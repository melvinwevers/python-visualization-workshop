Such is the importance of these developments that Mr. Simon Kapwepw~ , the Zambian Foreign MMinister, s pla4isng to leave the conference to\" f1 back to Lusaka todav and repOrt to ,President Kaunda. .This is not a Zambian walk-out, because Mr. Arthur Wina, the Finance Minister, is staying in London to head the de*M tlon Tie African Prime, Miniter, details in a special afer net session restricted to one inister and one official for each delega- tion. No Fundamental Change by U.K. Although it was being put about in Whitehall yesterday that Mr. Wilson's speech does not repreteat any fundamental change in British policy-certainly not such as to ustify the recall of Parliament- the African delegationb evidently felt that, without concedlnl their demand for NIBMAR (no indepen- dence before majority African rule), he had said enough to open up the posibility of a compromise.

   "text_content" : "By LEX I More of the ground lost last Thursday on the ICI interim was won back yesterday. by the leaders. The index ended the day 2.6 points to the good at 303.5, having been 3.1 points up at noon. Presumably the August trade figures, due to-day, led to the caution in the afternoon. Business is still at a painfully low level and yesterday's bar- gains were the lowest for any Monday since December 16, 1957. Winget Gloucester Winget Gloucester's gearing is quite something; at the end of March last Â£3.16m. of net assets was charged by Â£4.04m. of loans, debenture and net overdraft. The handicap this imposes on manoeuv- rability is formidable. The over- whelming consideration must be keeping ah eye on the Â£2.7m. over- draft-it has dropped to a lower level now-since the opportunities for funding are nearly non-existent at the moment. This is not the time to -sell assets to claw back cash. nor is it a time for a rights issue in view of the recent dividend cut. And for the moment, quite apart from the shortage of charge. able assets, the convertible loan stock will prevent any kind of addi- tional charge on assets until it finally goes into the limbo of non- conversion next November. Watching the pennies is plainly one reason for the dividend cut since banks do not take kindly to fnancing short-earned dividends and maintaining the 15 per cent. rate would have meant just that. One the face of it, however, even the reduced rate, 12% per cent.. not quite covered, is vulnerable. After all 40 per cent. of the 'Â£14%m. turnover is accounted for by the construction equipment division where demand is tied to bousing to a large degree. How. ever the. prospects are not that black. Th:' ,re of'the business is fÂ£1m. betwe va rous fttpg S.e sni i ~leh are largey b ng theft 'own. Moreover if there is gong - be a rationaliattion of :the gonstruction equipment indus- ty Wingt should take a leading rote. At 8s t.e yield is 8 per cent. but that is what. it should be- all the time the group's hands are tied by the shortage of cash. See also Page 15 Keamey & TreekWr Kearney and Trecker's bid of 20. a share for the 3.4 per cent. It does not hold of Kearney and Trecker-CVA is fair enough. It is the same price paid for the former managing director's 30.9 per cent holding in June and represents 19.2 times prospective earnings. However, the crux ,of the matter is that K & T Is starting a massive investment programme which could mean \"no dividend will be paid on the Ordinary shares . for some years ahead.\" Since the Sbulk of the unquoted Ordinary Sshares in public hands are held by Semployees and ex-employees, it is *obviously sound labour relations to. ve them a chance to bail out Thi is a much better example of SU.S. controlled companies' Sbehaviour towards their minority SU.K. shareholders than we have recently seen. First there was Crown Cork which just gave up dividends for three years despite a , clean balance-sheet without any gearing or overdraft. Thefs came North British Rubber which made a rights issue above the market price, forecast higher profits and then omitted the dividend seven months later. A bid from the parent, U.S. Rubber, some six weeks after that was hardly designed to endear it to the minority who accepted with dis- tinctly bad grace. See also Page 15 A. B. Engineering Selling Bergius-Kelvin to Ruston and Hornsby has shown up the weakness of what is left of Associated British Engineering. The previous year Kelvin con- tributed Â£130,000 before tax and Mackay a: Â£55,000 loss, so the rump, Parsons and British Polar Engines, made Â£55,000 before tax. In 1965-66, however without Kelvin and Mackay and excluding a special hon-recurring dividend of Â£19,000 the rump has produced only Â£18,000\"pre-tax. Not enough Sto pay the Preference let alone te t repeated 6 per cent dividend. For Sthis profits would have to rise to Saround Â£120,000 pre-tax. The trouble is it Is difficult to Ssee what hope ABE has of hitting this target True, repaying the Loan stock will save Â£18,000 in a full year. But the real villain Slooks to be demand for the group's r marine engines. and with competi- t tion sharp in the field ABE could Swell find life staying at least as hard as it already is.

SSee alio Page 14 Berni Having zipped up from a little over 7s to 13s in 1963.64. the Berni Ordinary have since demonstrated their abilities in the other direction I' and the current price is 5s 10%d SDespite the tiny, 2.04 per cent., yield, the fall looks as though it has gone far enough. It is true that fast growth looks unlikely this year but then a 10% times p/e ratio is not looking for a lot Moreover the share price ignores the chance that the group will eventually Sdecide to buy other companies to use its management expertise, See also Page 14",

The signing over the week-end of the trade pact between Indc nsia and Siniapore is expected to channel more rubber into world trade, and this was the immedia- reason for yesterday's fall in price On the other hand, marke sources are finding it very dificult to pinpoint precise reasons for the steady decline in values which has now been going on for several weeks. There is a current surplus of better grade rubber in Malaysia, where production has been run- m lng at high levels, but the under- yIg statistical position of the material certainly does not appear to wholly justify prem vs le. The Soviet bloc, for one., is ex- pected to take substantially more rubber this year than last, as is Commnst hina. It is su sed, however, that because a re pro- oron of this trade in th form f bilatral areements between the countries concerned and does not use normal market channels, it will take sometime for the hea Communist offtake to be refected n values.

C. Brackenbury, metal brokers, in London yester day. His company, which is associated with the well-known metal brokers Rudolf Wolff, was Slaunching a book dealing with all aspects of the LM's work. Mr. Brackenbury said that the Exchange had been in operation for 84 years, but there were still many firms who could use its facilities with benefit, and who had little or no knowledge of its functions. The book, running to 109 pages, is probably the most comprehen- sive of its type. It explains futures trading, hedging operations, and includes records of price move- ments of copper, tin, lead and zinc from- the reopening of the market after the war until June this year.

In those diffult inter-war years the pold store aid well, and so did another pnev n venture, this thie int clsivted blackberries. Beifre- th wna ever 70 acres of blackberries were being grown, mostly for canning. Ufortunately the crop became infected with a virus,t wicheduced yields to less than a half what they had pre- viously been. To-day virusfrees viously been. To-day virus-free Edward and Henry Crowther. stocks are available, but the sma now is the high cost of pickin, even if one can et togethr a su- cient gang of pickefr. Indeed, the cost and dificulties of getting hold of the large num- bers of casual workers growers have traditionally relied on is now largely determinmg the pattern of crops grown. The Crowthers to-day employ 25 men and 15 women full-tine, plus 100 to, 120 casuals. But for picking fresh peas and beans, for instance, they now rely heavily on schoolchildren dur- ing their summer holidays and the trouble is that not all crols ripen neatly within that eight-week break. The Crowthers' answer to the labour problem is the obvious one -mechanisation. The problem is made more difficult for many growers in the Vale because not only are the majority of holdings s mall, even the little land nmost Sgrowers have to work is badly frag* -mented into anything up to a dozen plots which may be miles apart s The Crowthers themselves now have a farm near Pershore as well r as their land on the outskirts of w Evesham, but they have at least I been able to simplify by cutting M out sprout gowing on the Cots 5 wolds 20 miles away. 3 Real progreis towards mechani- Ssation of harvesting is being made. W Many of the trials with the -* National Institute of Agricultural i Engineering's prototype vegetable a harvester-now to be manufac . tured under licence by Catchpole e Engineering-were. carried out on f the Crowther's land. The brothers' is conclusion is that it will work y splendidly with leeks, delivering ot the crop into a trailer which then s takes them to the central pack- hoqsit or wash nd paok=nn sending to market uay, the ain e wi tdo a go job with bA , ut io this instance t I i -not ssilciently h1igh ca mn - -a- -- ^ &lhve tmoe be deslga to e with the crop on the head- lands. It will also work well with sprouts bavest,,Ung the complete stems which *ll then be stripped in the packhousc. With palad onions, where the gross return can be as much as Â£800 per acre for a crop occupy- ing the land only three or four months, labour adds up to 80 per cent.or more of the Â£300 per acre Whih the crop costs to grow. Bti thais case mechanical har- ;wh i seems out of the question atthi stage, as the young onions need delicate handling if they are not to be damaged, which would mean .a .much reduced market returai . .The Cowthers are experiment- ing with a drill which will allow much moreprecise seeding. Not only does this mean less seed is i wasted-ad some vegetable seed is gdear-but it means both trans- planting and thinning can be avoided. There can be difficulties -as farmers who have tried drill- ing sugar beet to a stand have leartt-but the immense labour savings the new technique makes possible makes the Crowthers. confident that it must be the eventual answer. For the future they are both t much concerned with marketing , developments. The Vale of Eve- a sham has to some extent lost t giound to other areas because they Swere better able to meet the needs 1 of the bigger buyers. Evesham X has beea the home of traditional t co-operatives which serve mainly g the smaller growers, while the . bigger growers have mostly con* tinued to market on their own. i- But the time has now corne when ;. the chain stores are handling an e increasing proportion of the trade. l and they need to be served directly IV with large, regular and totally c- reliable supplies. This is something le neither the present co-operatives n nor individual growers can do by s' themselves.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "Roll) of dIaluahm foil stacked and awaiting Snal cutting and packing for hosehold me at the S Reynolds Metals plant In Richmond, Virginia. From Our Own Correspondent WASHINGTON, Sept 12. THE JOHNSON Administration's formal defence .of the new pack age of mild deflationary measures opened to-day with a firm promise to cut public expenditure by S3,000m. An apparently rather sceptical Ways and Means Committee oi the House of Representatives heard evidence on the programme from Mr. Henry Fowler, Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Johp Connor, Secretary of Commerce, and Mr. Charles Schultze, Director of the Budget Bureau. For the most part, the evidence was taken un with somewhat repetitious justifi- cations of the proposed suspension of the 7 per cent tax credit on new business investment in plant and equipment. The most informative part of the proceedings, however, was the evidence of Mr. Schultze, who made at least some attempt to prove that the Administration means business on the Govern ment expenditure side. He announced that Federal Agencies were being instructed to-day to cut back drastically on their use of paid overtime. Each Agency is required to take steps necessary to reduce overtime to the 1967 Budget level or to 25 per cent. below 1966, whichever is the lower. He was unable to say pre cisely how much would be saved, but officials indicated that it might be as much as several hundred million dqllars. Mr. Schultze repeated the President's contention that it ould be impossible to say exactly where the other cuts would come before th- completion by Congress of th- Budgetary appropriations for this Year. But he said that an absolutely definite \"first slice\" of SJOOm. in cuts was already being made. Of this $S1500m., about 70 per cent. ($1,100m.) represents delays and postponements of construction or other capital investment contract awards. Direct Federal construction, grants in aid, and loans, are all inr -olved. This represents about 10 per cent. of the Federal Budget for con. struction. About $50m. represents reduced spending for personnel and general, supbly procurement and the remaining $35Qm. Is spread among various Federal programmes. The second slice, with a target figure of at least $1,500m., will be cut later this autumn. Mr. Fowler's evidence, as expected, underlined the pressures created by the tremendous sur in capital in- vestment. His main difficulty was to explain, in the face of some per- sistent Congressional questioning, how the suspension of the tax credit would relieve this pressure here and now, since most of the existing orders for plant and equipment have a long time lag. This was partcularly em- barrassig for him. since he himself had pointed out this difficulty in evidence to the same committee last January. His answers to-day amounted to the belief that the chief effect of the suspension would be psychological; the fact that it was a suspension and not an absolute repeal that was nro- posed would, he said, tend to make it more effective in this respect. * Reuter reports that Mr. Fowler said after the committee hearing that the outlook for the U.S. economy in the months ahead was very healthy. He did not feel wage and price controls would be needed in the foreseeable future..",

Po rather usneppectddly, open housin has become the main issue in the.race for the Democratic o0mi1saton for Governor of this nottheastern state. Uptil six weeks ago, the. clear favourite for the nomination was Carlton Sickles, 45, at present a member of Congress. An extremely liberal legislator-he has a 100 per cent rating from the Liberal Americans for Democratic Action -Sickles has claimed that \"with Presient' Johnson, I authored. much * Great Society' legislation.\" He is a prot\"g6 of Senator Joseph Tydings who in 1964--campaigning on the theme \"throw the rascals out \"-led an effort by younger Democrats to remove the \"old guard\" of Democrats from rural areas. Sickles has promised Mary- land a \"new era' and calls the scandals which have hit the accident-prone Tawes administra- tion (J. Millard Tawes, the present Governor, cannot by law stand this time) the \"visible outcroppings of a rotten system.\" $380,000 Campaign His main rival has been Thomas Sinan, 52, who is currently the state's Attorney-General. He has had to tread delicately between defending too fervently the record of the Tawes Administration and dissociating himself from policies he helped to implement. Without doubt, Sinan has the.best-organised and best-financed campaign (by last week he had spent $380,000), but only recently has he begun to make an impact on Sickles' clear lead. As one aide told me: \" In July we were in deep, deep trouble, but that's all changed now.\" What changed the situation was the surprising emergence of open housing as the leading issue of the campaign. Sickles has consistently stated that he favoured \"the strongest possible\" fair housing measure. He promised that should the President's Bill fail in Washing- ton, he would propose a State Law which would have the same effect. Originally most of his opponents supported open housing (except for Charles Luthardt of the Fighting American Nationalists who wants As one aide told me: \" In July we were in deep, deep tr~uble, but that's all changed now.

Sickles has consistently stated that he favoured \"the strongest f~aibk\" fair housina measure. promised that should the President's Bill fail in WashiogÂ· ton, he would propose a State Law which would have the same effect. Originally most of his opponents supported open housing (exoept for Charles Luthardt of the Fighting American Nationalists who wants to arm all whites against negroes) but as the campaign wore on more and more came to feel that open housing was a certain vote-loser and carefully retreated. They retreated becaiase of the impact on the electorate of George Mahoney, a 65,year-old Baltimore contractor who has fought six un- successful campaigns-three for Governor and three for the Senate Mr. Carlton Sickles. -since 1950. Despite this record of failure, Mahoney is no crank candidate: he has always run well and occasionally come close to winning. This year he is fighting on one issue-vigorous opposition to open housing legislation in any form. \"Your home is your castle -protect it\" is his theme, and on canvassing trips an aide bellows into a loudspeaker that \"your castle is what Mahoney is fighting for.\" And to Maryland Democrats -who in 1964 gave George Wallace of Alabama no less than 42.7 per cent. of the votes in their Ptesidential Primary-his promise to veto any state legislation enforc. ing open housing has an appealing ring. The Sickles camp acknowledges that the Mahoney campaign has hurt, especially in the lower-income white neighbourhoods around Balti- more. Equally worrying, there are clear signs that Sickles is losing ground in the heavily-populated counties of Montgomery and Prince George's-suburbs of Washington which two months ago most candi- dates had all but conceded to Sickles. Mahoney has gained some support, but Sickles' followers are, more angry at a tabloid mot \"e over 100.000 voters in Prt George's County by local anI:\"a dates supporting Sinan. This makti out that Sickles advocateds thel relocation of indigent WaslsltW | Negro families in Maryland ild \"1 the \"busing\" each day of Negro . O-.; children in Washington to better ., schools in Maryland. The pamphlet implies, none to6orr lplomatically that the election of ickles would mean a massive exodus of poor Negroes to Mary-;: land. Sinan has refused to disown the pamphlet-arguing that he can- i not control all his supporters. To . Sickles, this proved Sinan was \"in- a bed with the bigots.\" The impact of these racial innuendoes was sufficient to force Sickles to devote a great deal of the last few days to trying to shore up support in his own district. Open housing has not. of course, been the only issue. Maryland's other problems have occupied much of the candidates' time-the State's finances, its education, crime and transport as well as its ailing oyster industry. (\" Sickles equivo- cates over oysters\" was one Sinan charge.) Pollution in Chesapeake Bay caused a brief flurry of accu- sations. Eventually Sinan went for a 30-minute swim in the bay to \"show\" it was not too polluted. 20% Undecided Nevertheless, the key to to- day's election is open housing. Over the weekend, all candidates exuded confidence, though they all have reason to worry. For every opinion poll shows an \" un- decided\" figure of at least 20 per cent.-and some even show a figure of 30 per cent. Most show Sickles still a slight fraction ahead of Sinan, with Mahoney third, but these findings are for the most part worthless. Maybe the undecideds just will not vote; maybe they will put prejudice aside and choose Sickles or Sinan; and maybe they will plump for Mahoney (which would give the Republicans an excellent chance of capturing the Governorship despite the three-to- one Democrat advantage in Mary land). The last prospect worries the leading candidates consider- ably: as a Sinan assistant said, \"if half these don't-knows are just people who won't publicly admit they're voting for Mahoney we are finished.\""

   "text_content" : "The 43rd annual general \"m ' \" of The Caledonian Trust Company Limited will be held on October 5 in Glasgow. The following is the cirulated. statement of the Cirman,. M J. L MumaAv: This-is my first statment as Chaim an and I would fid like to say how sorry the rd are to ee my brother, Sir R.Alistair Murray, sever his long connection with the Company. He retired as Chairman on reaching the ,age of 70 and is not seekin relection as a Direc- tor at the A ual General Meeting. Shareholders too will appriate how -much the ~iment strength of dthe rompny is due to his judg. ment and guidance, first as Joint Manager and since 1963 as Chair- man. Your Board are putting forward for election at the Annual General Meeting, Mr. J. R. Johnstone, a partner of Whinney Murray & Co., the Managers and Secretaries. Legslatve Complleatlem SThe past year has been a diffi- cult one. 'Conditions generally would have made it so anyway, but to these have been added the distortions of the 1965 Finance Act, which apart from the time and *fort expended in interpreting the law, have rendered the normal use of reasoning and logic in invest- meet decisions a matter of con- siderable difficulty. Dividends and Interest received during the year to 1st July 1966 amounted to Â£772,090 against Â£712,622 for the year to Ist July 1965. The figure for the past year. however, included a number or dividends which would normally hav; been paid after the close of the year on Ist July last but were in fact paid before 6th April 1966 by a number of Companies so that they could take advantage of the provisions of the 1965 Finance Act. We received in 1965/66 more than one year's income from these in- vestments.and it follows that there will be a corresponding short fall in. 1966/67. We. have therefore deducted such dividends totalling Â£52,929 from the gross revenue for .1965/66 and after providing the appropriate tax of Â£21,833 have transferred a net sum of Â£31.096 to a Suspense Account in the Balance Sheet under the heading of Revenue Reserves. The balance standing at the credit of Suspense Account will be brought into revenue in 1966/67 where it rightly belongs. After making this adjustment and taking into account the inevit- able decline in estimated Double Taxation Relief and some increase in underwriting commissions the gross revenue for the past year amounted to Â£780,646 against Â£794,684 for the previous year. This allowed a dividend on the ordinary shares of 11% per cent. again to bq paid leaving as surplus revenue for the year Â£40,980 which was added to the carry forward making a balance of Â£885,122 to be carried forward to next year. Delation Sies laeeaetve SAt home we are in the midst of a severe incomes and cadit squee imposed at a moment when the economy would iapear to \" V6 been turnin downwards apa. Prodroticna In April, My aind 1une a sinace then the delinelr as eoestper. Doubtless the delaory measure taken will benefit the balance of payments osition in the short term but are they lly any lasting solution for our basic problems in the longer term? Any course which tends to destroy confidence and the urge of manufacturing industry to modernise and expand and nullifies even temporarily agreements relating the wages of employees to production must lead to a lack of Incentive and to stagnation-a trend which may be difficult to reverse. In America the economy has also become overheated. There are signs of strain in productive capacity, prices are rising and imports are increasing. The war in Vietnam is increasing defence expenditure this year by S8,000m. and the cost is still going upwards with the result that the country is now carrying a sizeable balance of payments deficit accompanied by the symptoms we know so well of shortage of credit and higher interest rates. The Americans have managed their economy very successfully'n recent years and no doubt they will overcome their present difficulties, but their room for manoeuvre is now more restricted than it used to be and there would seem to be little doubt that they will have to introduce higher taxation to control the inflation and allow the economy to cool. The Future In the conditions which I have outlined the prospects for revenue in the current year can only be described as unfavourable. We are bound to get some reductions in dividends and in 1966/67 we shall feel the full effects of the loss of Double Taxation Relief. I would hope that revenue for the year will be sufficient to cover the present dividend of 11 V per cent next year without recourse to our revenue carry forward which is substantial but a maintained divi- dend seems certain to involve the distribution of a higher percentage of revenue than in the past.",

SHMnFMa (the chairman) presiding. The following is his circulated p statement: oi In my statement accompanying a last year's Accounts I said that, providing nothing unforeseen ociurred, I anticipated that this year's trading results would show o' further improvement. I am now pleased to be able to tell you that not only has the confidence I showed th been njustified but also that this ear's profits are a record for our Group, t It is my considered opinion that n this is a very satisfactory achieve T ment. We have had to face % numerous additional c6sts, many tl of which are the result of Govern- n ment legislation and so beyond our o control. On export contracts and o most long term contracts in the v U.K., increased costs cannot be n recovered from customers, but ti have to be offset by greater al efficiency and higher turnover. On the 29th March, 1966, we established a Holding Company. si the name being changed to tl Horseley Bridge Limited. This will a facilitate the co-ordination of our e operating Companies and should sfrengthen our organisation to meet C the challenges of the future. Commander Buist, who has been h our Deputy Chairman for a con- a siderable time, has now reached a the age when he would like to res- trict his activities. He has, there- fore, resigned as Deputy Chairman, but is willing to continue to serve F as a Director. In this way we hope to retain his services and wise counsel, which have been such a benefit to us in the past. I am very pleased to inform you - that your Board have elected Mr. Vincent Senior, our Managing t Director, to be Deputy Chairman. Mr. Senior has been largely res- ponsible for the Executive Manage- ment of the Group since 1953, and during this period we have emerged successfully from a serious reces- sion in the Capital goods industry without showing any serious diminution of profitability. In his new position of Deputy Chairman ] he will still carry out the executive I control to further the progress into the new fields of Engineering we are entering. Financial Comments The Group profit before tax amounts to Â£401,453, compared with Â£361,468 for 1965. The re- vised basis of valuation of work in progress, which I mentioned in previous years, i now operative tebuslitst. the Group :and will permit morre-alistic omparisons of trading sults in futtue.

Your Dimre- tor recommend that a Final dlvi. dend of $% should be paid on the Ordinary Share, mlakn a total dividend of 7% for the year, and that Â£127,600 sould be put to Inoeral reserve, raising it to 2 0,o00. If them recommenda- tlon s accepted, a balance of unapprpriafted profit of Â£218,161, will be carried forward. The Directors of Horsley' Bridge Limited at the annual general meet- ing held yeterda, decided reluco tintly to amend the final dividend to 5% In accordance with h govrnment's requltt not to in, crbas dividends at the preant time.

France to-day took a slightly more flexible attitude towards the problen of International liquidity, in retrn for a tough declaration from an six Common Market coutries on the need for the US. and U.K. to get rid of their payments defcites. , After to-day's meeting of the Common Market Finance V Ministers the chairman, M. Werner, Luxembourg Prime Minister, said he thought France would participate in the next round of negotiations on a contingency plan for the creation of fresh ,international liquidity. But he also made it clear that differences of opinion still remained between France and the Five on the desirability of elaborating new international monetary institutions right away. These differences are evidently somewhat smaller than at The Hague meeting of the Group of Ten, when it appeared doubtful if France would consent to join in future negotiations. The report of the Oroup' of Ten had proposed that the next stage of international talks should take place jointly between the Group of Ten and executive directors of the Inter- national Monetary Fund. Contrary to the tradition of the three-monthly meetings of Com- mon Market Finance Ministers, the French to-day insisted on the .publication of a communiqud of substance, and' thiy are clearly satisfied that their bargaining position has been considerably strengthened for the meeting of the IMP towards the end of the month. They have had to give some ground, but they will go to Washington less isolated than before. Two Main Points The two main points stressed in the communique are: 1-No' new mechanism of interna. tional liquidity should be put into operation until there is a better ' ullbrium in the payments balance of the leading countres, notably the reserve currency countries, and until there is joint agreement that there is generalised shortage of reserves. No such shortage exists to-day, says the communique. 2-The deliberate creation of inter- national liquidity should not be em- ployed as a means of aiding the less developed countries whose economic growth requires diferent and specific forms of aid. such as investment aid, technical co-operation and trade policy. Since the Americans first launched the idea of a worldwide conference on liquidity the less developed coun. tries .ave, seized on the iea a a way out of their economic difficulties. The Common Market countries, on the other. hand, are aware that they are likely. to have to bear the main burden of financing any fresh crea- tion of liquidity, since they are the world's leading creditor countries. SThis point was made very strongly in a- declaration issued just before to- day's meeting by M. Michel Debrd. French Economics Minister, who stessed the price the European coun- tries would have to pay. He also 'appealed for solidarity from the Six, and the communiquE after the meet- ing shows that his appeal did not go entirety' uhheard.",

The Bundesbank report denies that renewed export Surpluses will have an undesirably extensive influence on Sthe home economy, since export orders are growing at nothing like the 30 per cent. rate at times recorded in 1959-60.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Corespondent THE DUTCH shipbuilding industry should concentrate on the production of tankers, less compli- s cated freighters, container carriers, naval vessels and drilling plat- Sforms. Larger production units should be formed through mergers of individual yards. These are two of the most important recommendations of the Keyzer Commission, a group of shipbuilders, senior civil servants, a shipowner, a trade union leader Sand a banker. They were appointed by the Government last Septem. ber under the chairmanship ot former Transport Vice-Minister, Mr. Mike Keyzer, to recommend ways to improve the competitive position of the Dutch shipbuilding industry. The Commission notes that the average Dutch yard now builds new ships at a considerable loss. For every Fls.1,000 (Â£100) earned in this way in 1964, the average yard had to pay out Fls.1,120. Repair work, which is relatively important in Holland, yielded an average profit of only I per cent. As a result of this and other sac- tors, the tonnage launched by Dutch yards in 1964 and 1965 was only 40 per cent. of the 1960 figure. (Over the same period, British production went down to just over 80 per cent., German to about 95 per cent., while the Swedes increased their newly built tonnage to. some 155 per cent.). At least one section of the Dutch report is'bound to cause consider. able anger among trade unionists. It says that workers- in Sweden and Japan work much harder than those employed in Dutch shipyard' where \"during an official working week of 45 hours we estimate the number of hours actually worked at between 35 ahd 40, while the working tempo in Sweden is much higher.\" But the Commission adds that most Dutch yards do not have a proper policy for treatng and promoting staff. THE HAGUE, Sept 12. In recommending that a Shipbuild- ing Council of not more than three members should be set up to help carry out the proposed mergers and the other recommendations in the Keyzer Report, the Commission says it is confident tiat its plans if realised will enable Dutch yards to regain profitability within four or five years. A thorough study of future demands has led the Commission to expect that world orders for new ships in the 5-year period 1971-75 will total the some 65m. gross register tons, an lew average of 13m. tons per annum. This ery Agure varies widely from the 19m. ray tons which Britain's Geddes Com- say mittee forecast as the actual tonnage is tobe produced world-wide by the year ad, 1975. ly Not Divulged tch The Dutch Commission asked the 40 Board of Trade in London to divulge ver on a basi of reciprocity how the on Geddes figures had beep arrived at st. \"Much to our disappointment the ile Board of Trade was not prepared to R y do this,\" says the report. ) Commenting on this. Mr. Keyzes ch told THB FINANCIAL TIMES: \"We er* think the British have been very short. It sighted over this. If their estimate nd is right our Dutch yards will be in an Ie unexpectedly favourable position re 'since we have naturally based our of recommendations to the Dutch in- of dustry on the assum tion of our 'en smaller world demand figure for 1975.

   "text_content" : "By Our Geneva Correspondent I3Vgs KRWS7PA B] nkMlhh.. me.,s,\".!. . .:W. . . ,, SWISS NEWSPAPER publishers and business interests are at odds over the succesful development ol commercial advertising launched Jla than.two years ago by Switzer tlan uped'rvised television etwork. Advertisers are not par ticulariy happy about a 16 per cent, irafte icrute for TV spots that will go lntq effect next January 1 with o backig of publishers. The newpaper publishers, on the other ha , a agimnt a proposed ex- t i6ftthe daily amount of time no to commercials as sup- pOrte- by industry interests. The opinion of the publishers carries a good deal of weight in this matter since their national associatio holds a 40 per cent. in. teret in the Aktieqgesellschaft for das Werbefernsehen, the company responsible for selling and broad- casting TV commercials. Another 40 per cent. is owned by the Swiss Radio and Television Corporation (SRG), while organisations repre- senting trade and industry, mer- chants, farmers and journalists hold the remaining 20 per cent. Swiss industrial circles, however, are understood to have worked out plans for raising the Werbefern- sehen company's capital from its present Sw.Frs.500,000 (nearly Â£42,000) and at the same time to expand industry's shareholding to around 30 per cent. They argue that since industry is the predomi- nant customer it ought to have a bigger voice in running the enter- prise in charge of television adver- tising. Press advertising damaged The publishers, who want no part of this, claim that TV com- mercials have already caused more damage to newspaper and maga- zine advertising than originally foreseen. They point to a survey among association members which showed that companies buying television spots had reduced their advertising in the Press by an average of 15 to 20 per cent. Par- ticularly. hard hit were medium- size newspapers with circulations of about 15,000 to 40,000, while small local papers and the big city Press generally fared better. In many cases these losses were offset last year by an expansion in other rs advertising, including advertise- ds ments from local merchants em- of ployment notices and political ed advertising, but this may not neces. r- sarily happen again this year. n' Understandably, publishers tr favoured the forthcoming increase it. in TV advertising rates, as they i considered it justid following the th rapid increase in television viewers le in Switzerland. The original rates er had been fixed two years ago, when x hardly 450,000 TV subscribers were e paying an annual licence fee of P Sw.Frs.84 (Â£7) to the Swiss Post Office, which keeps 30 per cent. rs for its technical services and trans. in fers the rest to the SRG. The al number of set owners has now just n, passed the 700,000 mark and is r expected to reach Im. in the next Sthree to four years. r Not to exceed n 12 minutes -r. This tremendous growth was not ts foreseen in 1957 when the SRG signed a financial agreement with r, the Swiss Newspaper Publishers' It Association aimed at keeping â¢. advertising off the screen. Under ts this 10-year contract the publishers y were to pay Sw.Frs.2m. a year to o help finance the television pro- o gramme until the number of sub- e scribers reached 180,000. This i. happened at the end of 1961, much a sooner than expected. Short of r- funds, the broadcasting corpora- r. tion sought to terminate the deal ahead of time, and after difficult negotiations agreement was reached on the introduction of advertising on television. In authorising this venture the Swiss Federal Government stated o that the total amount of commer- i- cials was initially not to exceed 'e 12 minutes a day, with no adver- i- tising to be shown on Sundays and y national holidays. Flooded by Sorders and aware of the large sinan- cial needs of the expanding g national television service, the ir Werbefernsehen management this n summer asked the Government for r- permission to broadcast commer- 1- cials 15 minutes a day starting next is January. e The Publishers' Association, y according to one of its officials, lost n no time in advising the authorities :t in Berne that its members oppose ;r such an extension in order \" to give Snewspapers a chance to overcome i1 the initial shock dealt them by tele. Ivision advertising.\" The publishers - recalled the Government's stipula tion that the Werbefernsehen com- a pany should see to it that the Swiss e Press suffers no disadvantages from y TV commercials, but it remains to e be seen whether their arguments i will be successful. Broadcasting cs circles, in any case, appear optimis- a tic that the request will be granted e shortly so that advertising contracts f for 1967 can be concluded. It Advertisers have shown strong i. interest ever since they received the Sopportunity to utilise the Swiss e television channel on February I, t1965. During that first year, 427 s companies bought TV spots to t present a total of 538 products, with foods, detergents, textiles, non- alcoholic beverages and electrical household appliances leading the list. (Advertising for alcoholic beverages, tobacco goods and drugs t is forbidden.) Orders for the cur- Srent year ran about 70 per cent Shigher than the amount of time available and demand for 1967 is said to be bigger yet. An official said that even if the daily time limit should be extended next year all orders could not be completely filled, though he conceded that some companies asked for more time than they actually wanted in Santicipation of the necessary cuts. S Three language Sservices S Whatever the publishers may Shave hoped, business has obviously not been scared away by the higher Srates to be applied next year. A I 60-second spot shown in all parts of Switzerland will then cost Sw.Frs.7,000 (about Â£580) instead of the present Sw.Frs.6,000. Prices Sfor the more popular 20, 30 and ' 40-second commercial will also be raised by around 16 per cent The rates are scaled for the thas : language areas of the country and I combinations are possible for any two of the three language services. SA one-minute spot televised in the t German-speaking part of Switzer- land, where about 70 per cent of the country's 6m. people live, will t thus cost Sw.Frs.5,600 next year, i while Sw.Frs.2,340 will be charged Sfor the French-speaking or Italian- : speaking area.",

But to increase the rate to five a month would have two benefits-a big jump in turn- over, and almost certainly a big jump in sales. \"This is a question of making the maximum bonus from our lead time in the supersonic field,\" *Sir George declared. \"Such an increased rate, however, clearly involves further joint initial outlay, and these things are now being Searnestly considered on both sides Sos the Channel.\" Last week, it was reported that the two Governments were now estimating a total development cost for Concord of Â£500m. (or Â£250m. each) by 1973, but this figure is understood to be still based on the Sthree-a-month production rate. Rapid Progress Commenting on the progress with the Concord, Sir George revealed that to date 90 per cent. of major structural items for the first proto- type, 001, had been made, and 78 per cent. of those for the second prototype, 002. Of a target to first flight of 35,000 manufacturing draw. ings, 29,600 have already been issued. He claimed that while the Con- cord had been described as a \"pres. tige project,\" in fact it was designed to make money, both for its operator and its manufacturer. He quoted the conclusions of Trans World Airlines, which had ordered Concords, as confirming his claim. TWA's estimate was that, after spending $142.5m. on a fleet of six aircraft, including spares, and operat- ing at a 55 per cent. load factor with 121 seats, and a utilisation of 10 hours daily, the Concord would earn a profit of $2538m. gross in a year, or 1l Am asftter nterest and tax. lrep. I C 5t -1.4m a r t t a -me enting a net return on its investment of 16 per cent. Discussing the Anglo-French Ja jet strike-trainer project .Sir said that drawings covering over 1,700 parts had been issued to the manufacturing shops here and in France. Prototpe construction wa advancin and we look forward to the first ight 1968.\" As to the projted Anglo.Prench variablegeometry icrft Sir George said that \"the conmno propo-sl or October, 1965, ha'hbee conrmed M t. all the sbseuent answers by both companies to official questifonnaires. A great deal of thought and wor' had gone into the design of this air- craft and when the task concerned had been defined. \"our cooperation with Dassault has been excellent.\" Referrin to other possible Anlo French joint projects for the futur, Sir George said he would like to see joint European projects supported by European airlines. \"I recall that at the Air-Bs Symposium held at London Airport in October, 1965, the airlines of Europe were expressin toncem at bein, left to the mercit of the American manufacturers. \"I see little sigs. of them doing anything about it, and 'it seems to me that BEA are liely to be the only major European operator not argelv committed to American aeroplanes. Derision-making The Duke of Edinburgh, addressin the Congress as Honorary President of the Royal Aeronautical Society, sai that while international co-operation had been surprisinly successful at t technical level, \" te system of ficial cooperation and decision-making still seems to be a bit vague. \" If it is important to see that avia- tion is fitted' 'into the national economy in such a Way as to enable it to function most eiciently, it is even more important to work out an international structure which will en- bance and encourage the chances of success, rather than frustrate and rdeift tiTm.\"",

   "text_content" : "From Our Scientlfc Corespondent BERKELEY, Gloucester. Sept. 12. One of the most important projects in aaid at the Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories of the Central Electricity Generating Board is aimed at saving at least 2 per cent, and possibly as much as 5 per cent., of the cost of fuel to be used in Britain's new advanced gascooled sctor power stations. Over the 20-year book life of each plant this could mean a ut of from.Â£1m. to Â£21m. on the Â£50m. total fuel costs for eact eactor. i Potential saving in the expected 30-year life of the 8,000 MW of plants in the second nuclear pro- gramme is put at Â£20m. This saving would be achieved by modifying the composition of the -nuclear, fuel so that the first loading could be left in the plant for four years instead of two. By analogy, a car started on a cold morning needs a different compo- sition of fuel-through the choke system-than one that has been running for some hours. The modification to the fuel is the addition of a certain amount of \"poison\" which absorbs the excess of nuclear particles. These would otherwise make the reactor too power- ful, more difficult to control and more complex in design. The poisons are destroyed after a period of time durin, which the power of the fuel a :h ko en of ess ild er-. ire ire me nel dreo? to more easily controlled levels.. The work is fairly well advanced and may even cheapen still further the power from the first advanced gas-cooled reactor, Dungeness B, now put at )AS7d per unit. Staff at' Berkeley are to-day prepar- ing to receive 130 guest physicists from the U.K. and abroad-including Russia-to discuss the difficult prob- lem of measuring the extremely low levels of radio activity such as those surrounding nuclear power stations. The conference is being organised b the Institte of Physics and the Physical Society in onjunction with the CEOB.",

The race is between two men-Mr. B. J. Vontr and Mr. Ben Schoeman-but late to-night Mr. Vorter's election had hta a rtidal N ari,nt become a virtual certainty. Mr. Vorter, who is at present Minister of fustice, has proved himself tr strong -man of the pa. thermore his election w bel fair result in that it would rct the popular support he undehbly enjoy in the con- stituencies. Very strong pressure was being put on Mr. Schoeman to-night to withdraw his candidature so that Mr. Vorster would enjoy the prestige of a unanimous election. The news of the London stabbing of the South African consul will in the present atmosphere, harden still further Afrikaner MPs' de- termination to choose the toughest man available. It is inside the caucus that his popularity is less evident. Im- mediately after the assassination Vorster made is clear that he was bidding for power and it quickly became clear that any struggle would become a test of strength between preferences of actual party bosses and actual voters. Mr. Vorster has only a few real supporters in the Cabinet and the older leaders would prefer Mr. Schoeman, the Minister of Trans- port, who is a middle-of-the-road adminisator, ouh and eficient, and enerally wellikd. Both men are from the TRn=nv; the Cape has no hope of provdin the next Premier because Dr. Dogps, the Finance Ministe is too old and Mr. P. W. Botb- the Defence Minister, is too young. In theory, Schoeman would have a good chance of victory because Senator de Klerk and Donge two senior leaders with reat influence, are both likely to prefer him to Vorster. Moreover, young, ambi. tious leaders are liely to spport the older man who would probably step down after ten years at the most. Division of Power If it is correct that Vorater is going to win, it can only be because the older leaden have decided-for whatever reason-not to throw their full weight against him. This may, of course, influence the future division of power between leaders. ( ever wins, a major Cabinet reihue is not expected until the end of the present Parliamentary session.)

Industrial policy will continue to be based on the resolution of 1956 which earmarks specific industries for establishment in the state and private sectors. Emphasis is also. placed on decentralisation of industries and encouragement to small scale and new. entrepreneurs. The manifesto reiterates that \"the policies and programmes would take the country towards a Socialist society where the principal meas of produc- tion would be progressivly speeded up, raising the standard of living of the people and ensuriva equitable distribution of the national wealth.\" Beyond this general enunciation. the manifesto does no, spell out the specific memsure of .ponue of action. There are, 'OWever. some recommmendatios like the. impositin ofaem r r inco es Its~~~ C t~s a.~~v distribution of house sites to the poor.

Actually, the drafting subsCommittee with tih Conyress Pe _d nt Kamaraj and Prime Minister lndira Gandhi as members, .favoured specific mention of bank nationalisaton, but onl to attract the wrath of the vocal right. wing leaders.

The draft manifesto speaks of t;h revival of the movement for self reliance, reducing dependence on fordign help and maximising utilie- tion of idle industrial capacity.

   "text_content" : "By Our Souathat Asia Correspondent TAIWAN - -1CE a Japanese coloOy and now undergoing a ftsurgence of Japanese economic influence--inevitably reflects the :Â«a eho*oa in Jsapr as to the cnoitic-effets of a possible end to the VietnPm r within a couple o 'yeart: Japanese businessmen apper to feel mid-1968 is the most liely date, and they are by no means happy that they can shrug off the loss of war-orientated export markets. ' Taiwan has not committed itself to thl trade to such an extent as japa=` b.tt it is none the less in- volvd in the general trading pat- terin which would be upset by an outbreak of peace in the Par East. The most ineresting medium-term development in Taiwan's economy this year has been the emergence of textiles as the best foreign ex- change earner, a position formerly held by sugar. The mountainous sub-tropical island with its 12m. or so poplation suffered badly from the world price fluctuations affect- ing its sugar sales in recent years. Bananas seemed a promising candi- date to replace sugar as chief ex- port crop, but most of Taiwan's bananas go to Japan and the Japanese importers have driven a hard bargain. Thus,,. the new concentration on textiles represents to some extent the familiar weariness of under- developed countries with depend- ence on fickle agricultural crops. However, about a third of Taiwan's textile fibres, fabrics, etc., go to the United States, and if Hong Kong's experience is anything to go on, American demand for tex- tiles is closely related to the war boom. Robust Chemical Industry Another robust new Taiwan industry is refining and chemical production. Much of the export demand for this industry-for instance for polyvinyl chloride sheeting-also stems from the war. So, probably, does part of the need for electronic components, which are now being widely produced in American - financed plants in Taiwan and shipped back to the United States. o aiwan's export economy 1 so a largely orientated towards Japan a as well a the UdvEi Strals that e a Japane recession caused by a e fall-olf in wnr demand would d seriously hit mnyi idltstries. e FortunAtelythefood caning busi n, ness, whi has.bo shipping out it -huge quantities of the delicious a Taiwan mushrooms, pineapples g and now asparagus, to North I America and Europe is not likely to' be affected. f Undoubtedly the' war boom has s cushioned the end of American aid for Taiwan-though in fact the l effects of the phase-out will not f be fully felt for a year or two, t as the aid in'the pipeline also dries n up. Taiwan can continue to expect v shipments of American surplus a foodgrains if it needs them, though \" the Americans may insist that it y virtually abandon its lucrative sales s of home-grown glutinous rice to r Japan. It is also already receiving sizeable sums of American private Sinvestment, particularly for the chemical and electronic industries. s Infrastructure Well S Developed The big question is whether Tai- t wan can continue to attract enough investment and in a wide enough . spread of economic activities to .continue development at its recent s pace. Already, the infrastructure is well developed by Asian standards, Sand the World Bank has made loans for further work on the roads Sand railways. The Government has r a large reservoir of investment ex- pertise but if private investment is to be attracted over a period of years it will be necessary to keep labour costs at their present very low level. This will be increasingly difficult as shortages of skiled Slabour become more acute, though I there is still a big under- t employment problem in the r countryside which can help supply the unskilled industrial work force for some time to come. I The obvious source of capital 1 should be'Japan, but Japanese pri- Svate investment so far has been Ssurprisingly low-estimated by the Economics Ministry in Taipei at only about SlOm., though there o may be almost as much again in n concealed investment. .The Taipei it Government, which screens all a foreign investments, may not have' 4 been keen to come completely into . the Japanese economic orbit until i. all other sources of capital had at been explored to the full. I Rigid Political iy Stance This Government. after all con. \" tinues to regard itself as the legiti- \" mate Government of the whole of Ae China, of which Taiwan is merely t a province. Its political stance is 3, rigid and extreme, and it would be ' in a seriously embarrassing posi- \" tion if it were at the end of an economic leash held by Tokyo. h whose political attitude is in- it tentionally ill-defined and whose M great commercial ambition is to 0 open up trade with the Communist g Chinese mainland to a much e greater extent. e At the same time, economic de- velopment must continue to be a main concern of Chiang Kai Shek's regime-his prime slogan is: \"Construct Taiwan, regain the mainland.\" The two aims are closely connected, for the National- Sists consider it incumbent on them. h selves to show that their rule is h more successful economically than Sthe centralised effort of the Com- t munists. What infuriatesthem most ' is the Communist charge that they , have been built up simply by mas- Is sive American aid. This is one reason why Taipei keeps up a Smodest but rather effective pro- t gramme of agricultural aid in small ,f African countries. The other, and more cogent, reason is of course P the need to keep Peking out of the y United Nations. d The Chinese consider themselves h particularly well qualified to r- advise other developing nations, ie but their enthusiasm for the pre- y sent moves towards tighter regional e co-operation in South-East Asia is rather tepid.' Perhaps, the il Nationalists feel that to divert their i- attentions in this way would be n an admission that they could never ie return to the mainland, an opinion it which no Chinese official in e Taiwan would ever express openly.",

SPIRITS are low among the 100 or so British companies represented here at the International Leather Week, some of whose stands the U.K. Ambassador to France, Sir Patrick Reilly, visited this after noon. Along with many of their com- petitors from other nations, some report a sharp fall-off of as much. as 30 per cent. in orders, inquiries and even attendance at the Fair, which ends to-morrow. Two main reasons are beins offered. First, there is a widespread belief in the trade that leather prices are on the way down and more advantageous buying terms will be possible in a few months. In the second place, all the firms I talked with agreed that the rising cost of money throughout Europe and Amierica was forcing com- panies to cut back on new orders and run down existing stocks. Leather fashion goods is the one section of the trade that seems to be holding out against the gloom prevalling elsewhere. Business here, I was told, was well up to normal, although it only accounts for 20 per cent. of the industry as a whole.",

There is no mystique about pro- 1 ducing effective. foreign-language i literature-only good sense, careful planning, and know-how. Never- iheless, it is true to say, pitfalls The commonest mistake of: ot allowing enounk time, tatdo the job properly creates dificulties and results In inferior produdtions. Translation is the key to success and must be carried out by pro- fqssionals. It .is, best done by natives of the country in which the literaturetis to be used, referably Qspeone connected with; or.having complete knowledge of, the indus- ry concerned. This ensures not only idiomatic and technical preci- son but also accuracy of style.

Designing for foreign-language printng is a hsgly specialed skill and a qualified graphic 'designer can mai Pe psible several interest- ing and effective ways of presenting multi-language literature economic- aily. To begin with the ultimate: eanh language could be produced as a separate publication, and a ;uefil tip hee is to print the title ii English in a convnieni place (for example, op the back cover -Of a booklet). 'Provided require- ments can be foreseen. cost can be =aved by designing literature so that blocks can be commoq to all abguiages and printed as a separate -n if .they are in colour. International In prestige work it may be a good idea to print several languages in one booklet. Thus an international scale of activities is put across in the best way: It is occasionally possible to produce a booklet in English and interleave it with pages, perhaps semi-transparent, bearing one or more languages. Captions can then be prited in the correct position w'ith the appropriate illustration visible through the interleaving sheets. Successful large exporters set up elaborate organisations to ensure accuracy and quality in their foreign-language literature. The smaller exporter cannot afford to st up a comprehensive' organisa- lion, but provided he'intends to do the job properly he can obtain all the help he needs to produce the right business-inducing article. The great majority of printers do not set out to provide this service and may take on an occa- sional foreign-language job as they would any. other job, but there are printers who can take the exporters' English-language copy and carry out:all the operations involved through translation, design and printing, to delivery on. to the exhibition stand, including. all. the necessary documentation, crating and transportation.

He thougt the best solution lay in deflning long-term strategy vuia wbich a variety of tactical decision could be taken aceording to the continuing play of bvent*. The sheer uncertainty of the future needed Wome derie of humility in not laying down hard plane. Stumbling Block But he could not see that any consiltant could do other than asume that vast general, social and indultial iamprovements would con- tinue. On fhat other basis was one to work? But it was this long- term viewpoint which was the great stumbling block for council- lors whose midds tended to be beset with present shortages and strinsgenies. In 1962, a year befor his report, Professor Buchanan addressed the RIBA conference with his earlier thousht on the acute problem of trafic in towns, presenting only two alternatives for its solutiot: either we adapt our towns to triffic or We adapt trafic to the town. To-day he spoke of the three years since his report which have enabled him, as Professor of Trans- port at Imperial Colloge London, and the subsequent tithlor of a number of considered plans for cities and regions, to look back upon the growing insistence of the original problem and to offer fur- ther and maturer views on the immediate future. That the future is immediate is certainly not in doubt. In 1962 Professor Buchanan estimated a total of 35m. vehicles on Britiph roads by the year 2000, with 26m. private cars. His present estimate is a total of 21m. by 1976 and 32m. by 1987. with a long-term estimate of 40m. soon after the tur of the century-augmented by a urther 20m. population It is not so far of. Main Principle He stipulited one principle by which ithe resulting problems of accessibility and environment could be sorted out. This is \"gradually to create, inside towns and cities, units or areas where consideration of en- vironment are paramount and take prechdence over the movement and rking of vehicles.\" The essential orollary \"is to have a highway net. work (outside the towns) on to which longer movements of vehicles from PWL.

There- fore in such areas futurb demands would have to be cut down to sizs. Broadly peaking the cut was bound to fall, not on the use of motor vehicles for the essential commercial and industrial purposes, but on the use of cars for optional purposes, especially for journey-to-work for which public transport could be pro- vided or exists. Sgrhat deal of money would be ee to accommodate triffic in town and society was faced with the hard choice of finding the money or curtailing the trafic. Society could not continuo indest- ing at the prtesnt rate in the purchase and runniSn of motor vehicles and yet refuse to put an equivalent in- vestment into accommodatin the traffic that results. When a ensely populated community decided to arm itself with motor vehicles on a big scale the results were moit embarras. sing. Alternatives Professor Buchanan was at pains to discount the impression that his 1963 Report contained positive recon. meadations for early and elaborate urban reconstruction. On the contrary it set out to isolate the three main variables aplicable to all urbeh areas: Firstly the required level of accessibity, secondly the required standard of environment. and thirdly the cost society was prepared to pay in altering the physical structure of an area to improve accessibility., or environment, or both. If a town wanted to use a great deal of traffic in civilised conditions it must be prepared to spend a great deal of money on physical altertos. It need hot spend the money if It reconciled itself to having less traffic. But what it could not do was to have lots of traffic and not spend any moneyv. money. a imall amount oh tefi Â« bÂ« d tth t valid. achl wa So Sacifice out .some fairly dr i measures In CmMidnt a te o stuh4 tr had e20 t rioulc it ,oath, ProcyfEor Bu ha .hlds te ld not aes an answer to lte trtc problems there which did ns tt nvota sacrifice of the city's arthtectura heritage with out some fairly drastic measures, in- clhis ea tnt elT in Towsh area. csp tral**''' and tho o others.

Ptua Steae, of the Scent.al Institute of o rnomic and Social Research, said that the con- struction industry would need to in- crease its output by 2 r cet. a year to achieve the l,000m. to 240,000m. worth of work required dyer the next 40 years. It would not be easy for the in- dustry to secure an average rate of ncrease of this order for a period as of new housing mlaht in the long run long as 40 years. An increase of productivity at this level would imply anoutput per worker of 150 per cent. reater at the end of the period than is achieved tofday.\" The raising of the lusing targt to 500,000 dwelins a year by 1970 im- plied an annus increase of nearly 6 per cent I the short run such a rate of outtput might only be possible if the resources devoted to other sectors were reduced or at best kept Constant. A slower rate of raising the output of new housing might in the lng run result in a more efficient use of resourcets. Mr. Z. A. Weld-Thrmpa, In a paper on \"Colour in the External Environ. ment,\" said that colour more than any other factor had been responaible for the cheapening of architectural cx- presson during the last 10 years The country Is already sprinkled with bad examples of buildings that evidence this situation.\"",

This move comes at a time whet the motor industry is sxperiencinj a turn-down in demand as a resull of the economic situation. Biggest Customer Ford's own labour force is, it fact, already its biggest single cus tomer. About 6,000 new cars are bought by Ford workers ever) year and an unknown number of sales result from recommendations to friends or their influencing ppur chases among relations.

The rankd of the office orkers have been persistently groang: forty yeamr ago.there Mere i m.; to-day there ar\" well over 3t., the vast majority of them women. Indeed, between 19S3 and 1963 the annual in- creae averaged 3 per cent.- compared with a mere 6.7 per cent. expansion in the U.K.'s total labour force. And industry and commerce would have em- ployed still more if only they had been available.'. No Change This position will not change. Official studies predict that b the early 1970's the need will be for 600,000 additional re- cruits; employment agents say that this is an underestimate by as much as 10 or even 15 per cent. Certainly at the moment the shortage in London is \"almost as high as it has ever been,\" according to the Employ- ment Agents' Federation, and, what is more, this shortage has now extended to many other parts of the country which were previously less affected: the rest of the South-East and the Bir- mingham area are said to be particularly badly off. In Central London there are currently four vacancies for every job-seeker. In conse- quence, salaries are again higher than they were 12 months ago; they are higher, too, than at the beginning of the year. A salary of Â£1,250 to Â£1,500 for a secre- tary is now claimed to be the rule rather than the exception. It is in fact likely that if 30,000 clerical workers were suddenly to become available in London alone they would be rapidly absorbed, and within a year there would once again be the same shortage: demand is multi- plying all the time. There is thus no evidence of redundancies, nor is there the likelihood of any; When the 1962 recession met up with the \"bulge \" of employment seekers (over 35 per cent. of girl school leavers go into clerical work) the ratio of vacancies to girls never dropped below 1.2 to I in any one week even during the worst months. All these shortages mean that for an employer it now costs II I I aondon's tedly. rm) or an \"v'pl n o sy111 them. *sortage in Load I.l, at end of he \" * eaptif' As i esulf drift therre e how miore girls than men in Britain' larger coniirbations. \"They drifted for the glamouj and the wages from Harog to Leds and from No pton to \"ondon.\" But as more office jobs becobme available Ih the provinces, too, had.more inpor- tant. rates of pay,re levelled up, the girls prefer to stay put and London's of re anagers have to find -sew ways and means for getting the work done. A good miany companies hve changed over to centralised lic- tating systems and otheeforms of \" pools.\" Private secretaries are allocated-only to top men: the rest of the work is.carded out on a production-line basis. All the 18 companies recently surveyed by the Institute of Personnel Management agrqed that the advantage of this hew arrangement outwelghed the dis- advantag . .-. They reported higher productivity,. Ã½eduction in staff recruitmdnt, more even distribution of the work load, *More efflient service to execu- tives. better quality of work: more economplc use of staffT avings in costs and time. and greater flexibility. In two cases the intake. of secretaries wa reduced by 5Q per cent, Brief Respite Almost all the companies found that both shorthand and obpy typists were ' favout'able in their attitude' to the central- ised system and can be success- fully trained. as audio typists.\" Six companies gave an increase in salay b'tothe audio typists when t'y introduced aentral- ise dd tatoi!-o - company offered coMpensatory terms amounting to abbot six weeks' wages to ihorthand typists will- ing to train as audio typists. In four cases, however, there were resignations. But If U.S. experience is any- thing to go by. the centralised system may well bring only brief respite: it is said that a complete reversal of Ideas is happening across the Atlantic. There the middle echelons of U.S. management are being iven \" think-time.\" and to facilitate this process their female staff are being restored to them. The Americans are increasingly. up-grading the female's role in business because they are recognisinsg the com- Plimentary nature of male and female aptitudes.\" If such a development were to be repeated in Britain, t would need colossal traninig efforts. Apart from the top men's top secretaries, clearly a class apart, there are few who at present could readily step into the breach while their middle manager bosses retire to have their \" think-time.\" But as long as realistic job evaluation, selection in accord- ance with such evaluation and not by personal whim,, and systematic training remain the exception, the office staff prob- lem will not be resolved-in spite of centralised systems, or a wider use of temporaries, as is also suggested by some. It takes 120 staff to do 100 office work units as and when these are required, claim the advo- cates of using temporary staff. This means considerable permanent over-staffing. Filling Gaps At present the agencies be- tween them employ some 24.000 \"temporaries\" and hire them out. They insist that 10 per cent. of these women would not be available for employ- ment on any other basis. Another 10 per cent. are likely to be between permanent posts, and the rest is made up of those wbo are temperamentally un- suited to work permanently in the same office and of the older women who cannot find a per- manent position because of their age. The use of this labour force in a planned and well- organised fashion could fill many gaps, avoid mis-employ. ment of the better qualified, and under-employment of perma- nent staff \"hoarded\" to cater for peak times, and thus help to reduce labour turnover, which in central London has reached the astronomical figure of 50 to 55 per cent. (A mitigat- ing factor is, however, that nearly half of this turnover may be \"involuntary,\" that is, due to moving away from the area, for health reasons, and so forth.) As for systematic training, a recent Labour Ministry report disclosed that only 8 per cent. of the U.K.'s young office workers get any such treatment. There is only one nationally recognised training scheme- the Commercial Apprentices Scheme. As the shortages con- tinue, emphasis must clearly shift from numbers to qualifi- cations, and managements and clerical workers alike must be made to realise that this will be the only way out of a perpetual stop-gap situation.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Economics Staff Personal saving rose threefold in the period 1952-55 to 196265, even when the fall In the value of money is allowed for, according to n analysis In the Bank. of England Quarterly ulettn for september, pubil eu to-day. As a ratio of personal disposable income, personal saving increased from less than 4 per cent. in the early 1950s to around 8 per cent. in 1960-65. The peak, in the savings ratio have usually followed periods in which real disposable incomes have been rising fast They generally Occur in years when action has been taken to correct inflationary conditions and when growth in real consumption has fallen. Thus measures to control the growth of incomes after the rapid increases of 1955, 1960 and 1963 curbed consumers' expenditure and led to peaks in the savings ratio. in 1956, 1961 and 1964. On the other hand, when the savings ratio was law, measures were,taken to stimulate demand-in 1954, 1958 and 1962. The Bulletin stresses three ,reasons for the growth.in personal saving.' One is the rise in general prosperity.- as people become richer they are' able to save a greater proportion of their incomes. The growth of pension schemes, particularly ocupational schemes, has also had a big influence, with life insurance and pension funds accounting for about half the in- crease in saving. The spread of owner-occupation 'and the asso. ciated growth in saving through building soieties has been another important factor. The personal sector's share of total domestic saving rose. from 17 per cent. in 1952-55 to 31 per cent in 1962.65. This increase was largely at the expense of com- \"\"I ---~Y ~~~~I~IYY I panics, whose share fell from 57 per cent. to 48 per cent., and was related to a rise in the proportion of profits distributed as interest and dividends. Capital Expenditure Personal saving takes three main forms, the Bulletin states: (1) capital transfers to the public sector (death duties, less grants to bodies like universities which form part of the private sector); (2) capital expenditure, largely new house buying and. investment by unincorporated businesses (which also come into the personal sector); (3) investment in financial assets. Although capital expenditure in- creased by 80 per cent in real terms during the period, and there was also a substantial net rise in payment of capital transfers, the growth in saving was very much greater. So the personal sector's financial position has swung from a deficit in the early 1950s to a current surplus of over Â£600m. a year. On the liability side most of the personal sector's identified borrow-- ing, the Bulletin states, falls into two categories. The first, consist- ing of bank borrowing and instal. ment debt, largely finances con- sumption. This has been restricted during periods of credit control, and the Bulletin shows that con. ~\"' \"\" ~~\"\"'\" '\"\"\" \"\"' \"\" sumer purchases of durable goods are strongly influenced, by the availability of credit ahd also, to a less precise extent, by changes in personal income. .The second category, borrowing for house purchases is freer from official control. Total borrowing rose from a yearly average of some Â£200m. in 1952-55 to nearly Â£600m. in 1962-65 and was associated not only with the growth. of owner-occupation but also with the rise in prices, which was particularly steep after 1958. Short-term fluctuations were caused largely by changes in the build- ing societies' net receipts on shares and deposits after a time lag. On the asset side, one of the main treads has been a steady fall in holdings of marketable securities. Since the figures became available in 1961 the personal sector has made large net sales, rising from Â£325m. in 1961 to an average of over Â£700m. a year in 1963-65. The largest and steadiest growth on the assets side has been that of life assurance and pension funds, which are regarded in the national income statistics as the collective property of the personal sector.",

At present the estate Is served by : short road which leads out of a crescent containing some 50 houses. Following complaints from the re dents about the heavy traffic passing heir homes, the Minister of Tras. port has signed an order limiting lorries to 2 tons unladen weight. The managing director of one cf the factories, Mr. J. H. Elvins of Harvey Ironworks, said yesterday that his order had been passed without any consultations or a public inquiry. He thought that the local council was as surprised as he was at the sudden decision. Mr. Elvins stated that a lot of the companies on the estate were involved with exports and used very heavy lorries. Two factories have been there for 20 years but 11 more have moved in during the past three years with the local council'sencouragement and Board of Trade approvaL . Mr. Elvins explained that he and the other companies understood the residents' complaints. The solution was for the council to build a 600 yard road from the aide of the estate away from the houses to a main road.",

But it was never thought the least bit likely that the dlter gence would be corrected to any appreciable degree by advances in the general level of Interest rates in the U.S. itself. The presumption of a lasting Sga between American and other rates was implicit, indeed, in the decision of the U.S. authorities earlier In the 1960'8 to introduce special tax arrangments to eqalis U.S. rates with those prevailing elsewher in respect of borrowing by the more -dvanced countries. Thus it was rgued that oply by this means could borrowers in such countries be discouraged from permanently :laning on the New York market to an undue extent and doing so for easons of telative cost rather than aP inably to satisf thoi. .eqm eknts1elewhere .

The hnt eflect is that. without necessarily having intended to, the U.S. has been in process of moving from a defensive to an offensive position 'in the international interest rates war which has been developing over the past year. And just as she has had to take action to protect her balance of payments and domestic finncial structure &aainst other people's dear mponey rends in the past, a situation is now being created wherein other It people are having to strt tlhhklid 1in terms of prottordg their bat.

Some of the dmnibrrassiu con- Ssequences for the outfside world Sthis highly . mporant .change in r the international Interest rates Ssituation is calculated to hve re I already becoming apparent. The6 are to be seen, for one thin, i the steep rise in the cost of obtln. Sing finance for supporting ltle 0 national trade in the Euro-dollar market-whereas rates here were 1 running at less than 5 per cent. in the early months of last year, they Sare now in the 6Y2 to 7 per cent. range. They are to be seen, for another, in the fact that for countries whase borrowing in the U.S. Is subject to interest equalisation tax penalties, the cost of raising capital there has become more or less prohibitive. For even countries with atroo balince of payments rasons tor W anting to bofrow abrfad cannot justify paying rates for finance in foreign countries that are well above those obtaining in their Sdomestic capital markets. The SAustralian Government reent] Sindicated, for instance, thtt ft Swould not be able to renew dollr loans falling due for redemption t during the course of the next year C if U.S. Interest rates reinained as Shigh as they are at present.

   "text_content" : "FOR SOME TIME past now, a number of British Ministers have been suggesting that the real objective of their efforts to implement an incomes policy is to arrive at something similar to the Swedish system of wage bar- gaining. Whenever the incomes policy suffered a setback, Mr. Brown or someone else was cer- tain to point out that it had taken Sweden years to achieve what the British Government was trying to do in a rush and against the background of ex- ternal crisis. What Ministers have seemingly failed to ask themselves is whether the Swedish system is designed to produce the economic results they are trying to achieve. Near to breakdown Sweden is a country with a high standard of living and one which, at least until this year, could serve as a model of in- dustrial peace. It has not, how- ever, been any more successsful than Britain at containing infla- tion and last year saw a marked deterioration of the trade bal- ance. For some years wages have been rising faster than pro- ductivity and the latest wage agreement ensures that this trend will be maintained. One particularly ironic feature at present is that Ministers' admira- tion of how the Swedes handled their industrial relations has been voiced at a time when the Swedish system came nearer to complete breakdown than at any time in the last 20 years. Centralisation is the key feature of wage bargaining in Sweden. At intervals of one or more years the trade union organisation (LO) and the Em- ployers' Federation meet to argue about and eventually agree on a nation-wide settlement for manual workers. Both sides work from carefully prepared economic briefs. Usually the' main point in the debate is what* sort of wage increase the national economy can in fact stand. And in recent years at any rate, the negotiations have been con- ducted in the full knowledge that, whatever overall figure is agreed, wage drift in an overfull employment situation is certain to add a few more percentage points to it. When Mr. Callaghan last week hinted .that the Government would have to continue run- ning its incomes, policy until the CBI and the TUC were able to handle the problem between them it was pre- sumably the centralised method of striking a bargain which he was thinking of-minus the acceptance of wage drift, presumably. But what must be realised is such a system can only work if the trade union movement as a whole enjoys sufficient authority to make its members accept any settlement reached. In Sweden this is pos- sible because there are fewer unions, most of which cover whole industries, and because there is a coherence of purpose which is manifestly lacking in this country. Greater flexibility In the last resort, no method of wage fixing will stand against the pressure of economic forces If labour is in short supply, its price will be bid up. Centralised wage bargaining can never be a substitute for economic policy. Where the Swedish system of trade union organisation does score is in the recognition that a tightly knit and therefore very Spowerful union movement has a Sresponsibility to the nation as a I whole as well as to its members SThis feeling may not do aiythini to moderate wage increases: Swhat it does encourage is much r greater flexibility in the approact . to new working methods and I techniques. It is the Swedish S ous willingness to help ensur . mobUity of labour and its more t idlclent use which should be the I teal model for this country. i tecnnlques. It is me Swedisn ; usions willingness to help ensure 8. mobility of labour and its more t idclent use which should be the It eal Model for this country.",

Implicitly, the job also involved judin bow suc- ssfl he Stock ange is in assessing companies' prospects. A good deal of work went into the exercise. The results, add the implications, seem to be worth setting out and discussing. After all, some of us have been brought up in the belief that the back two pages of THE SINAN- CIAL TIMEs do play a consider- able part in directing the nation's capital resources into the most profitable channels. And much as the British may dislike the idea of profitable investment, our future depends on it. \"Picked with a Pin\" The recently piblished book, \"Higgledy Piggledy Growth Again,\"* by Mr. A. C. Rayner and Dr. Ian Little, waswidely interpreted as putting those back pages of the Pink 'Un in their place. The pages are a mine of information, and very useful to investors. But on the Rayner- Little findings they do nothing to help capital to find out where it ought to go. \" Growth performance does not enable one to detect manage- ments which should be entrusted with more of society's savings than others.... The investor is not successful in spotting com- panies whose profitability will increase.

It might - s well be picked with a pin.\" That's forthright enough. But it's not new. Before the last war I Mr. John Thorman, then a . member of the London Stock Exchange, studied the price per- I formance of nearly 1,000 equities : over the period from 1874 to 1938. He found that when the group was divided into two por- tions, the initially higher yielding I portion always in the end per- formed far better from both an income and a capital point of view than the initially lower- yielding shares. Fortified by these historical I findings, Mr. Thorman produced his High Yield System, and set up a portfolio based on its rules in May, 1939. We don't, to my knowledge, have any record of a low yield portfolio set up at the same time, but we can compar- the performance of Mr. Thor man's high-yield portfolio with that of the FT index shares Swhich are, f cotrse, all market leaders. it The results, which are set out * in my table, bear out Mr. Thor- a man's thesis, and are not flatter- : ing to the judgment of the - market in 1939 in its evaluation * either of the supposedly more : risky and less poomising high i yielders or of the supposedly - sounder and more promising 9 market leaders. G Classic Example Moreover, as it happens, that 1939 high-yield portfolio in- l cluded what I personally regard d as the classic example in our -i time of Stock Exchange mis- s judgment - Great Universal y Stores. f The GUS record is sum- : marised in my chaMt, which is mainly based on fgures whih the company wasglpod eSouao , to provide& 'n 7 on a logarithmic scale- many other British companies would require the use of such a Sscale to record the growth of their profits over the last thirty years? What I have called the \" price-earnings\" ratio is in fact Sthe number of years' purchase of a profits the market capitalisation Sos the equity represented year by Syear. The dividend yields, where z available, are those ruling at the time of the issue of each year's accounts, except that the final yield figure is the current one. It is quite clear that th- t investment world looked down its nose at GUS consistently I during that company's most r dynamic growth period. It . wouldn't touch the shares in the 3 late 'forties and early 'fifties when they were yielding 7 per *a cent. and more, and their market s capitalisation represented only -e y.ear'T pt4CLtg bi profits.

Jiul -of -tir sytem; partly because the yield was too low. Other Mistakes There aren't many Gussies i the British economy-more's the pity-but any student of invest- ment knows the other mistakes the investment world has made through its extremes of fashion; the post-war years have been littered with booms which went wrong in, for example, atomic energy, hire purchase, insurance, industrial holding companies and so on. All this seems to suggest that Mr. Rayner's belief in the old pin may have a good deal to commend it. It so happens, how- ever, that earlier this year I was Tn: FINANciALTIMEst companiet would be described. Anyway, the market performance of the ten U.S. income stocks between 1950 and 1966 is almost identical with that of the Dow Jones Average. But whereas the Thorman -ystem demonstrated that high yielders did better than our index, the Babson exercise made it clear that ten low yielding U.S. shares, selected on the underly- ing investment characteristics of each company rather than on detailedforecasts of future earn- !ngs growth, did much better than the \"income \" portfolio. The periods covered are not quite identical. Although the t-o Babson portfolios were =elected in 1950 (and in contrast to Mr. Thorman's high yielders have since been left undisturbed) the figures were in 1950 carried back to 1940 (a year later than the Thorman base year). The latest. valuation for the Babson portfolios was in February this year, or before the break on Wall Street, just as Mr. Thor- man's 1966 valuation was made before our market broke. The two tables, it seems, are reason- ably comparable. Finding an Answer So far as I know, as I have said, we have no comparable list of U.K. low yielders going back as far as 1939 or 1940. But if Mr. Thorman's main thesis is right, and history seems to have proved conclusively that it is. his High Yield Portfolio would",

   "text_content" : "Sir,-A number of facts arise from your editorial and the corre- i. spondence on it dealing with the information on price movements collected by the Purchasing Officers Association and given to the Department of Economic Affairs. In particular may I correct one J error? k Your editorial implies, and Mr. SAshley's letter (September 6) states Sa condemnation of a professional d body being used \" as confidential d informant not for the general Y ptblic or for industry as a whole, Sbut for a Government.\" However Sthe facts behind this statement are Sincorrect, The Information on * price movements, collected by the Purchasing Officers Association * from certain members, with the r approal of their companies, is Is published by the POA in the it \"Purchasing Bulletin\" which d appears weekly and Is available to - anyone who wishes to subscribe. d This Information is also pssed to s. the Department of Economic e Affairs, and the relevant data of v the previous price Is also included, d The only matter which Is not pub. lished is from which of our members this information has been received. Everything which is passed to Government is available to industry. Therefore any implied criticism concering confidential in formation not available to the public, is both inaccurate and unfair. Professional bodies should be willing to assist and co-operate with Government, as long as these. requests are reasonable and do not run counter to professional and ethical standards. We would be most critical of Government if its policy was based on inaccurate in- formation. When Ministries sped- fically ask for help in compiling correct data professional bodies should be the first to assist Lastly, no one has bothered to point out that although the Pur- chasing Officers Association advocate that its members should do everything to keep prices down we are the first in normal times to hold that justifiable price in- creases must and should be met. The success of a good contract Is one that is fair and advantageous to both buyer and seller. Pari EMEv, Director, Purchasing Offcers Assoclation. York Houe, Wetminsir Br'idgJ goa d, S.E.I.",

It is understood that talks comprised an informal examination of the terms under which the chairman of the National Steel Corpration will be appointed. The search for a chairman from either Inside or outside the idiix- try has apparently not yet been finally concluded and yesterday's consultations appeared to centre on the size of salary and conditions. Allowance Salaries at present paid to chair- men of State enterprises range from Â£11,000.to Â£12,500, though the head of British Overseas Air- ways Corporation, Sir Giles Guthrie, receives Â£15,000, and an extra Â£1,000 allowance. If an appointment is made from within the steel industry, it seems likely the Government, with final Treasury approval, will have to ,offer a higher salary than usual. A precedent was set when Dr. ichard Beeching was seconded from Imperial Chemical Industries to the chair of British Railways. Mr. Marsh is expected to make an early statement when Parliament resumes on the progress which has been made in arranging to set up an organisin cotmmtte to smooth the way or theState take-over. The chairman of the proposed Steel Corporation will play a key role in the interim period before Vesting Day under the Iron and Steel Bill, which gives him the right to be consulted' about the appointment of between 10 and 16 otner.members. Both the DIA and the Ministry of Power declined yesterday to make any comment about yester- day's Ministerial talks. Federation Views Meanwhile, the steelmakers' organisation, the British Iron and Steel Federation, is believed to be well advanced in preparing a more detailed statement about its feelings on the future shape of steel produc tion. Its development co-ordinating committee, under the independent chairmanship of Sir Henry Benson, is now planning to submit in due course a set of detailed proposals for merging steel companies into large competing multi-product groups.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Reporter SOME workers at the State-owned steel works of Richard Thomas and Baldwins, Bbbw Vale, could lose as much as Â£2 a week as a result of a pooling system ps labour agreed between the management and the five craft unions. It will, however, avoid redundancies which would otherwise have taken 'place. RTB last night described the agreement as \"quite revolutlonary\" and praised union officials for relising the necessity for reducing costs. Pay Losses Possible The agreement affects 250 auxi. liary craft workers, including mates. They Will go Int a labour pool and the company will be able to use them oanany work within their unions. But tle craft unions have also agreed to the possible transfer of workers from one trade union to another; the 250 workers will therefore be eligible to fll pro. duction department vacancies. Workers entering the new pool will not automatically lose money, but they do face the pos- sibility of.losing shift and night- work payments, and this could lead to losses of around Â£2 a week. A national official of one of the five unions involved said that simi. lar pooling systems were being arranged In oher' steel plants so that labour could be more effi. clently employed and. redundancy avoided. The RTB agreement has been approved by local officials of the five unione-the Amalamated Engineering Union. the Electrical Trades Union, the Bollermakers' Amalgamation, the Associated Society of Woodworkers and the Amalgamated Sdclety of Panters and Decorator, .

   "text_content" : "By Our Economics Editor MThe Bank of England expects a substantial improvement in the balance of, pyments, Swhich should show a surplus in 1967 as a whole. It can also already \"see signs of a A slght easing la the dom(stc economy.\" The rtemalr l mnrnmPmnt will tatI Inn.. *a m. ..... n . The .eternal improvement will take longer to appear, partly because of the timq needed for last July's measures to work through the system, partly because of tight money abroad and partly because \"confidence, seriously impaired, needs time to grow again.\". r--- -- again. These views are given in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin for September published to-day. As was to be expected, the Bank fully supports the July measures as \"an earnest of the * Government's resolution to maintain the exchange rate for sterling.\" If they are to. have full and permanent -success, the Govern- ment's measures should be, in the Bank's view, \"understood and accepted by the nation as a whole.\" The measures involve \" unpalatable restraiit, restrictions and postpone- ments,\" necessary in the short term to reduce home demand and cor- rect the balance of payments. \" Profits will be harder to earn at honie and there will be an incentive for firms to make the most eft- cient use of manpower,\" Payments deficit Thie B6lftiin: reveals that the paymentir deficit in the second quarter of 1966; is likely to be less than .in teflrst, when it reached Â£99m. As the adverse balance of mbnetary movements, so far is at p.taet k qown, eha'thi* ,e .blancg item \"must have 'been negative in the second quarter, largely as a result of the outflow of short-term capital which contributed to the July crisis. Despite the more favourable payments prospect, the Bank re- ports that there were still uncer- tainties in the sterling markets after the announcement of the Govern- ment measures, and \"the under. tone remained hesitant\" In August as well as July drawings were made on the facilities provided by central banks. In July the Bank had to provide the forward market with \"quite heavy support\" again, after two m6nths of little change in out- standing forward commitments. The July crisis The Bulletin still does not reveal the true cost of the July crisis to the reserves. But in the quarter ended in June, the reserves bene- sited by Â£45m. sterling from special swaps with the U.S. An earlier drawing of Â£54m. from the same -source was repaid early in April, but fresh drawings of Â£99m. nit were stbsequently made. These are in addition to the drawings on the swap with the Federal Reserves last June of an undisclosed amount As the published reserves fell by Â£106m. in that quarter, the real loss amounted to a figure in excess of Â£151m. The reserves also bene- sited in June by Â£12m, from a drqwing on the U.S. Ex-Im Bank, 'to reimburse dotlar progtess pay- menf' on Americatn military air- craft. - The Bank makes it clear that the central bank facilities announced in Basle on' June 13 were designed to offset the greater par of any reduction in the U.K. reserves due .to fluctuations in other countries' sterling balances whether official or etar mrI r fm lt 1006. 1up , - -. e ro er",

   "text_content" : "By Q RG0ALY Y .,Â·IÂ· TRfEWBLSH poured into Bris- tol last week.end, and the English invaded Wales: every- one was tyiog out the new bridge across the Severn. On Sunday the traffic jams were five miles and more long on each side of the bridge. ' Alt. this Is temporary. 'The questions people were asking at the weekwend were abodt more permanent thigsp what effect will the bridge have on the Seconomy of the whole Severn- side region? Will it make any difference to shopping, iht-seeing, the culture of Wales? In an attempt to fipd some of the answers I have just spent four days driving in and around the whole area. What follbws is literally a man-in-the-road's view of the effects of the bridge. The first of these is that it knocks some 50 miles-and therefore about 1 hours-off the trip between Bristol and Cardiff. The iaving in time and petrol is clearly greater than the 2s 6d toll charged for the bridge crossing. But of far greater importance than this is the fact that it is now possible to travel by car between both cily centres in around 1I hours. This will be cut to under an hour when the motorway be- tween the Welsh side of the crossing and the Cardiff side of Newport is finished in a few months' time. New Bus Routes The first to take advantage of this have been the transport operators. The Bristol Omni- bus company is running two services to Bristol and Cardiff, while British Road Services is proclaiming its lorries to be the most efficient method of local freight transport. British Rail- ways, which can still do the inter-city trip fastest of all by using its Severn Tunnel, did not seem to figure in conversations about getting to the other side. Buses up the Wye Valley for trippers, and Welsh chartered buses for visits to Bristol, were already on the road at the week- end. Restaurants and hotels in the Wye Valley expect to do well, and so do Bristol shops,* but Gloucester fears the loss of the Wye Valley and Monmouth- shire trade to Bristol Newport stores might also be losers. As between Bristol and Car- diff itself, however, there is not much to choose in shops. Bristol's shopping centre is the newest of the two, and contains all the maior chain stores; Cardiff's elegant old arcades have the same store names-as well as a few native ones of their own. Where Bristol has a clear advantage is in bright lights and enterprise. It is a bigger city, with far.better hotels, more and better restaurts, the \" Bistol Centre \" a vt Mecca develop. ent wi th, hall and ice rink ncludd d a host of pancake-bas, Wimpy bars, coffee houses, and (ubiqui- tously) Berni inns to attract young spenders. It is true that Cardiff, like Bristol. has a Top Rank dance hall-but the band on Saturday night was distinctly square. while on offer at the \"Scene\" was a group called.' The Syn.\" Bristol has its BristolP Old Vic, its Hippodreoae, and its Zoo. Tc the visitor the victor is clearly Bristol, whose attractions are paraded everywhere. Bristol is, therefore, likely tc do better in winning local trippers' trade (its shops re: ported a roaring trade in Welsh mioney on Saturday), but it might not win an immediate advantage in industry. What Ihe Bristol area (like so man, otbers) needs ir skilled labour. others) needs is skilled labour, of the service centre at the Its unemployment rate is still around 1.2 per cent., compared with a Gloucester regional figure of 1.4. Ip the Wye Valley and the Forest of Dean the figure is something'like 1.7, while fur- ther West still the need for alternative work for miners seems more pressing than ever. \"The trouble is,\" I was told in Bristol, \"these men are not immediately ready for work- most of them are unskilled or semi-skilled and need extensive retraining before they could be taken on in our engineering or aircraft factories.\" Even so, the prospect of bringing busloads of Welshmen across the bridge to work in Bristol factories is already present on the Bristol side at least. There remains the question of foreign tourists. The bridge probably cuts little more than half an-hour off the trip from London to central Wales, but it makes a great deal of difference to the atmosphere of the whole region once one is there. This could be one way of showing visitors around. Travel to Bristol in a Pullman in two hours, hire a car, drive up into the Oeo beauty of Clifton. There s at least half as much of. this kd of attraction to show the foreld tourist as in Bath, and if he 1 then taken by car through the motorway complex at the docks he will see something of modern Britain. The trip could then contliul (as mine did) along the Avon gorge, beneath the famous Brunel bridge (now lit up at night, like a crown in the sky) with a chance to tell of the glories of Victorian engineering. The city's ring road then runs up to the little bit of MS already constructed, and from there across the magnificent Almondsbury interchange to the MS and the bridge, which is undoubtedly one of the glories of modern British engineering. If the same cannot be said of the service centre at the Bridge entrance, then at least it is modern (with foot pedals for hot water and hot air for drying hands) and has a good view of the bridge. But once in Wales the advertised charms had better be of the scenery in the moun- tains or the picturesque grime of the southern industrial belt; even Tiger Bay lacks the jazzy attractiveness of Harlem. Cardiff does have its mock- Roman civic centre-a group of square, decorated buildings well separated by grass and, to cap anything yet mentioned, it has the Llandaff Cathedral. In- side it is the magnificent Majes- tas by Epstein-a floating cast aluminium statue of the risen Christ, set against what seems to be a concrete pipe standing on end above a compressed motorway bridge. It is, in fact, a concrete parabolic arch sup. porting the organ. The whole structure is grand, worshipful and, in its modernity and its materials, a piece of 20th-cen- tury art fit to be seen at the end of a journey across its engineer- ing counterparts in the motor. ways and the Severn Bridge.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY ST~Ai Joining the list of companies that have had second thoughts about a dividend increase is John Hagga, which is rescinding last week's extra 2 per cent. Asocdated Briteh Eaglaeerig profits have dropped, even after adjusting for the changed struc- ture of the group, but the divi- dend is held (see Lex, Page '). Derritron disappoints with profits well down and the divi- dend 5 points short of the fore- cast. But Motor Gear and Engiaeering has come up with a good half-year statement. Motor Gear The half-year figures for Motor Gear and Englaeering show pre- tax profits up from Â£225,000 to Â£250,000, and an effectively higher interim dividend of 8.3 per cent, against an adjusted 8 per cent., made possible by last October's Â£330,000 one-for-four rights issue and Clause 12. Subsection 7, of the Prices and Incomes Act The increase in profit, however, hides two points. Although the tufted carpet side has sold 20 per cent more, profits are burdened by the extra cost of expansion and have slipped slightly from Â£170,000 to Â£165,000. The engineering activities. on the other hand. are still surging ahead and, with benefits flowing from re- equipment, profits are 54.5 per cent. up at Â£85.000, compared with a 10 per cent. advance in sales. The value of orders is up on a year ago-reflecting more business and not merely delayed deliveries. Rut carpets contributing 66 per cent, of total profits are the mainspring of future growth, and although the next year or so could prove difficult Motor Gear is making sure of its position once things take a turn for the better. In the meantime the group is confident of holding its own and. assuming the Â£25.000 profits increase is held. a total of Â£550.000 with earnings of 53 per cent. look possible. A 20 per cent. dividend against 25.6 per cent. is a minimum hope (there is scope for more), so a 7.9 per cent. yield at 16s 9d and 6 P/E ratio looks fair enough. Derritron Last March Derrltron issued a statement to the effect that although it was- unlikely that the pre-tax forecast of Â£125,000 would be achieved, a \"reasonable\" profit was on the cards. But clearly the last two months were badly miscalculated, for the total is only Â£46,000, against Â£99.000 last year and Â£41,000 at the half- way mark. Moreover, although no mention was made last March of revising the dividend forecast of 25 per cent. on. capital increased by rights issues, the rate is now 2percent. This is hardly sur- prising. for earnings are only 16.3 per cent., and unless there is an improvement in trading, even this rate looks in danger, The basic cause of the setback is that - the domestic market for: electronic goods fell flat duling the year and remained so despite. hopes of recovery. On the Indus* trial side, business was bette and, exports did well but there weretill disappointments-for example, on, important order fell foul of oth' NATO embargo, In addition. ,t. appears that the bank oveardrkf4t is high and Interest charige, wlt up.

RQliAso A fair relehtinl Of the general declinq l world sto' k M ar tecan be seen In the reportof R.ateo N.V. This Dutch growth-fd formed by Robeco in November 1965. was very liquid at its year- end with as much as 25.38 per cent. of assets, Fs.218.7m.. repre- sented by cash or the equiva- lent. Astute managements are rarely caught on the wrong foot; the net asset value of Rolinco Ordinary shares in the balance- sheet is SIs.173 against the Pls. 166.50 issue price in November. And while the Board points out that the ample cash position is par ticularly opportune when price are low its intention is to Invest the available funds \"gradually.\" A geographical split of invest- ments at June 30 showed that nearly 24 per cent. of funds was invested in the U.S.; and one-sixth of that amount was in shares of one company-l.B.M. Portfolio adjustments in that country in- cluded the sale of Xerox which. with others, was considered \" over- valued.\" Funds attributed to the U.K. totalled over Â£1.lm. which was invested in seven companies, among them the Exchange Tele- graph Company. Although the Board has \" hesitated\" to increase its investment activity in the U.K.. it has nonetheless added to its holdings since the start of the current financial year. At 39s. the sub-shares yield a mere 1.3 per cent., which may not suit the normal run of investors; in the first half of 1966, however, 351 dealing$ in Rolinco shares and sub-shares were marked in London. Cooper Industries The report from Cooper lndus tries is reasonably optimistic about prospects; an improvement has been seen in the first quarter and profits for 1966-67 \"will not be worse\" than those of 1965-66, Â£246,000 pre-tax, against Â£231.00( -ex Â£70,000 from a non-recuttrri item. This is good going since roup profits last year were splil between building 41 per cent. engineering 28 per cent. and steel I 31 per cent., none of which have been having an easy time with thi S\"squeeze.\" In fact both the building divi Ision and the engineering side di( Sextremely well; house sales wer \"buoyant\" and the group's preci sion jigs and fixtures were in demand from the motor and air Scraft industries, particularly the I latter.

   "text_content" : "rroM 01 erose xoyalty and Taxation ... 3viwiueWJ &yt3'I ,UwR Mine production in the fir vixi months of 1966 was adversely fected by a s ious industrial dispute. The production of ore and the output of lead, and silver in concentrates were oolsequently lower than in the corresponding six months of 1965. Production of zinc concentrates Inceased slightly due to the higher grade of ore mined. The dispute was settled at the end of May and the rate of output reverted to normal in June, sincewhen the mie ha bee operating at full capacity. The substantial fal in profit for the first half of 1966 as comparedwith the irst half of 1965 resulted from lower prices realised for lead and zinc and a lower tonnage of lead in concentrate told. FORECAST RESULTS FOR 1 Based on the present production and sales programmes and assuming that there is no significant change from the present lead and zinc prices during the remainder of the year, the profit for the year 1966 before royalty and taxation, is estimated at Â£6,731,000 compared with Â£9,196,000 for 1965. The royalty payable on the level of profit indicated above would be Â£2.356.000 (Â£3,710,000). Taxation, which would be disproportionately lower owing to substantial capital allowances, would amount to Â£1,449,000 (Â£2,308,000) leaving a net profit of approximately Â£2,926000 (Â£3,178,000). The accounts of the subsidiary company will be consolidated for the first time this year following a receipt by that company of a substantial dividend from Sulphide Corporation Pty. Limited. The profit of that subsidiary, esti- mated at Â£172,000 (Â£41,000), will be added to the sum of Â£2,926,000 making a total available for appropriation of Â£3,098,000 (3,219,000). In addition, the Company is due to receve an amount, estimated at Â£370,000, which arises under the transitional \"underspill\" provisions which form part of the United Kingdom tax changes introduced by the Finance Act 1965. INTERIM DIVIDEND The dirtors have declared a interim dividend of Is. 4d. (UJ.. currency) per share, less United Kingdom income tax on the issued share capital of the Company in respect of the year ending 31st December 1966. This dividend will be paid on 2nd January 1967 to shareholders on the London and Melbourne Registers as at the close of business on Moeiday, 28th November 1966. If the actual results for the year 1966 are as indicated above the directors would expect to recommend a final dividend of 2s. Od. per share. MINE DEVELOPMENT The Company has decided to sink a new 24 foot diameter shaft 3.700 feet south of the present service shaft. The new shaft will be sunk initially to a depth of 3,000 feet and will provide ventilation and services for future large scale mining operations in extracting zinc lode ore from lower grade ore bodies to the south of the present main production areas. The cost of sinking and equipping the new shaft with winderhouse and other ancillary structures is estimated at Â£UK2,800,000 (SA7,000,000) and will be met from the Company's axailable resourts. It is expected that the shaft will be in operation by 1972. By Order of the Board, J. R. FRANCIS-SMITH, Secretary. 12th September, 1966. I I",

   "text_content" : "INTERIM 81 Unaudited aoeounts of the Ooup for the first eix months ended Sth June 1966 (27 weeks), show a profit ubject only to taxation, of approximately Â£250,000 compared with a profit of Â£225,000 for the first twenty-six weeks of the preceding year. Sqles of Tufted Carpet increased by 20%, 'but due to increaed expense and costs, profit. abilliy was slightly lower at Â£165,000 (Â£170,000 for 26 weeks). Sales of Engineering Produots lceasd by 10% and profits were raised from Â£55,000 to 865,000. At a Board Meeting held on 12th September 1966, an interim dividend for 8+% was doolared on the existing Ordnary Share Capital of Â£585,589 TATEMENT which lat October was inread by a Rights Iaue of 1 for 4 (last year,I% on Â£468,471). The Carpet Company is continuing to expend by the installation of additional productive and handling equipment and by introducing new carpets to meet the growing requirements of the Retail, Wholesale, Mail Order and Export Markets. Whilst the turnover of the Bngineering Com. panles increased by 10%, the value of orders out- standing at 5th June was greater than at the end of the corresponding period last year. Although it is impossible to forecast remults for the year, it is believed that both Companies are in a reasonably strong position to withstand the ffects of recent credit retrictions. mmnmmmmummemm I",

The boir neroegy ml deigned and built by William Boalto, engineer, cleaning ups prior to glazing at R. I. and S. L. Plant' china factory at Stokeon-Trent.

William Boulton has successfully adapted what is called a vibro- energy mill originally designed for deburring and polishing metal.com- ponents, to tableware. In this the rubber-lined container is partially filled with wooden chips and then subjected to three-dimensional, high frequency vibration that causes the chips to progress spirally round the container. Ware is' fed piece by piece into the mill and is cleaned by the time it has made one revolution. The latest development (not shown in the picture) is an automatic spiral ramp unloader so the ware can be taken away by conveyor. The mill, it is claimed, can be operated by the unskilled, is more economical, and handles all types of ware without adjustment. Four are now successfully working in the pottery industry, apd the com- pany is currently negotiating its first export order with a Finnish customer. The mill is also being adapted to handle plastic componerts.",

These factors, coupled. witthe inclusion of an estimate4 Â£172.000 profit from a subsidiary- hould give New Broken a net profit available for appropriation of Â£3,098,000 against Â£3;219,000 last year. A reaction from the peak metal prices of last year has, of course, been the basic reason for the turn-round in earnings. But the company was also hit in the first half of this year by.an industrial dispute and this is shown up in a fall in ptre-tax profit for the past six months to Â£3,507,000 compared with Â£5,341,000 in the first. half of 1965. In its dividend forecast, the com. pany has bad to bear in mind not only U.K. tax considerations, but also the decision, now announced, to sink a new Â£2.8m. shaft .This -will be financed from internal resources and is expected to be operational by 1972. TRONOH FACES A DIVIDEND CUT AJthough profits are expected to be higher this year as a result of ex. panding tin production, Tmoeb no longer feels that it will be possible to maintain the 's 6d dividend rate on its increased capital as was hoped in April when an. option on 1.7nm. shares was exercised -by Charter Conolidated. In his annual statement the Tronob chairmani'd . ,. W. Simms, explains that since then the tin price has fallen (by about Â£160 to Â£1,226 a ton last night), Charter has exercised its option on 49 per cent. of the im- -portant Ssmgei Bidor subsidiary and, of course, Tronoh now has to pay full U.K. tax on dividend distribu tions. On the other hand. the *ong term outlook for the Malaysian tin group remains encouraging, especially in re. gard to the Sungei Bidor expansion. The dredge at work on this area should be joined in October next year by the Southern Tronoh No. I unit which is now being re-erected there and it is hoped in the next few months to start the tranfer of Tronoh No. 5 dedge to the area. Mr. Sun, & 6comes the restora- tion of peacl relations between Malaysia and Indonesia and calls for the removal of the tin profits tax which was understood to be a tempo- arry measure designed to finance Malaysia's defncet needs. Giving shareholders a useful review of the commodity situation, he is confident about the outlook for tin. He takes the view that it is lack of supplies rather than high prices which eighten the risk of substitute materials and .e points to the im- portance of maintaining a good price level in order to keep the marginal mines in action. The statement was not known in market hours yesterday when Tronoh 5s shares closed un- changed at 19s 6d. NEW MOUNT ISA PLANT OPENED Mount Isa's big No. 2 concentrator and the new deep K57 shaft have now been officially 'commissilWed by the Queensland preiner, Mr. G. F. It. Nicklin, despite a union call (or. a 24-hour 4trike. The concentrator is the bigekt single project in the Australian lead-zin-copper.producer's 10-year expansion .programme which aims at a daily ore output of 16,000 tons compared with about 11,000 tons at present.' A gradual increase in the daily ore treatment rate can now be expected but full benefits of the new plant and shaft will not be felt until the middle of next year. Going down to 3 800 feet the SAllm. shaft is Australia's biggest high-capacity unit. It will eventually be, an important asset in the mining of a new major copper orebody discovered at 4,200 feet and below the existing deep-level -workings. Mount Isa's life, in fact. stretches far ahead, beyond the lives \" of anyone present, or their children,\" according to chairman Mr. G. R. Fisher at the annual meeting in November. GLEN LAKE SILVER OUTPUT HOPES According to the general manager, Mr. M. C. Halstead, prospects are excellent for another good year's ro- duction at Canada's Glen Lake Silver Mine.- As already reported here, _ ---- silver output hit a new peak in the year to July 31. Final settlement n fiures now show that the 12-month r total was above earlier estimates and amounted to 1,353,556 ozs compared with 1,277,205 ozs in 1964-5. P But it is still not known whether I the company will pay a dividend for the past year. A major consideration is the company's outside exploration; Sis anything worthwhile is found, funds will need to be conserved for the Sconsequent financing needs. Meanwhile, Glen Lake, like other SCobalt area mines, tends to live from hand to mouth as far as ore reserves. are concerned and over 40 per cent. Sos capital spending goes to explora- Stion work. This is producing the de- f sired results and a recent estimate Spt over 3m. ozs of silver in sight. SThe 1S shares are quoted in London at 12s 9d. SGOLDRIM SEEKS MORE GROUND Canada's Goldrim Mining is endea- vouring to acquire further ground adjacent to its Plelauff lead-zinc-silver prospect in northern France. The main zone at Plelauff is estimated to contain approximately 152.000 tons of ore averaging 6.5 per cent. lead. rand 7 per cent. zinc together with some cadmium, silver and germanium. S As already reported here. a $300.000 exploration programme is to Sbe carried out in three stages at the SBrittany property. The company's a consulting geologist thinks that suffi. Scient ore has been already disclosed I to warrant the operation of a 200 tons 0 fore a day mill for at least three years. Goldrim\" are currently around 6s 3d in Canada. j MINING BRIEFS e ELECTROLYTIC ZINC OF AUSTRA. 0 LASIA-Four weeks to August 24: Risdon Works 10,690 tons zinc.

The following is the circulated statement of the Chirman, SiR Nicsnoi.s CAYZR Dr.: Since last we met a number of significant changes have taken place In the affairs of your company. On 31st March of this year you were advised of t pa ment of a further 22Y, per cent. gross on account of thie \"old arrears on the Preference Shares, of the receipt of dividends amounting cumulatively to Â£325,000 from CrewiLrne Investments Ltd., and of the consequences which flow therefrom. 'ou were infAInrmd l.,.n that this wax all in accordance with the Scheme 'of Arrangement and Further Reconstruction approved in February. 1962. As we start a new chapter in the affairs of the Group it may be useful to take stock of the position as it is to-day. So far as the capital structure of the Company is concerned we have now reached a stage where, under certain conditions. dividends may be paid on the Ordinary Share Capital. The. conditions which have to be met are that the current fixd. cumu* lative dividend of 5y per cent. per annum is paid on the Preference Share Capital and that a further 2% per cent. pr annum is paid on account of \"old\" arrears on this Capital. The present Ordinary Share Capital is Â£300,000, but this may be increased to Â£500,000 at any time prior to 31st December, 1971, if out. standing options to take up a further Â£200,000 of Ordinary Shares, at a premium of 25 per cent, are exercised. Profts With regard to profits I think the best guide I can give you is to start with the Group Profit for the year to 31st March, 1966, of Â£108,905. You will have noted that in arrivingat this profit a deduction of Â£13,714 has been made in respect of Minority Interests in Crewkerne investments Ltd. and there is stated by way of a note that \"in future the net income of that company attributable to Sterling Industries Ltd. will be 50.5 per cent.\" As the net income of Crewkerne Investments Ltd. was Â£74,389 it follows that if the new division of profits of Crewkerne had been in operation for the year under review the deduction for Minority Interests would require to have been increased by Â£23,109 to Â£36,823 leaving a net Group Profit of Â£85,796. In order to appreciate the position more fully it is necessary to have regard to the nature of this income, that is, whether it is \"franked investment income\" or trading income which has been subiect to Corporation Tax and which, if distributed, will have to be charged gross in the Accounts. If, for this purpose, we assume that the only franked income of the Company arises from its shareholding in Crewkerne Investments we have available net franked income of approxi- mately Â£38,000. The Group Profit may now be restated as follows:- Profit per Accounts ..................................... Â£109,000 Adjustment of Minority Interests ..................... 23,000 Â£86,000 Of which:- Franked Investment Income ......... Â£38,000 Other Income ............................... 48,000 Â£86,000 Franked Investment Other Income Income Interest of Shareholders in the profits of Sterling Industries Ltd. ............... Â£38,000 Â£48,000 Deduct: Preference Dividends (net) in- cluding additional 2* per cent ...... 16,450 Â£21,550 Â£48,000 Gross Equivalent ........................ 36,680 Â£48000 Expressed as a percentage on the existing Ordinary Capital of Â£300,000 ........... 12.23% 16% Expressed as a percentage on the Ordinary Capital of Â£500,000 assuming options exercised and interest earnings of 7 per cent. on subscription of Â£250,000 ..... 7.34% 11.7% I regret that it has been necessary to burden my remars with this somewhat academic explanation of our affairs, particularly as the figures which I am using refer to an earlier period. However, I have felt that this background information may make it easier for you to place a proper interpretation on the figures and state- ments included in the Accounts. The Outlook Having taken stock of the position I will now turn to our future prospects-our hopes and aspirations. At Crewkerne we have a first-class modern factory engaged In branches of the precision enineering industry In which we consider there is scope for expansion. Here, in hydraulics, sinterings and electro mechanical instrumentation we seek to create a pattern of continuous development and during the current year we are not only replacing outmoded plant, but also dding further modemr uipment to Increase and improve our output, The acquisition of Huntley & Sparks Ltd. fits neMly into our dmvopment programme for not only does it produce a wI raie Of high precision units for many leading companies in tish d ry, but components for our own production are mnufacturld in is fatory at Mitcham. Inevitably, there is a tinmelag between th incurring of capital expenditure and the transtlIon of the Incrdasd capapity into profitable employment. HbeI .lour M agli Director tI well seized of this problem and iNkh every pol1 o wans of reducin it to a minimum. We are very indebted to him and to his staff whether on the factory, loor in the ofhie p as managers. for thei efforts on our behalf. This review would not be eomplet i thut ip ere to the present economic itatllont. We, it I te ourselv from it and, while I ha vevey confld the teprospect of this Group and alttlug profts to d shw.dmunprovemen as comnared with the profIa for th S period of last year, must advise you that wae ra It IpenadIfo or o success on th< ganeral level of econole aetMOty; pRvl Ijo in the Country. ,,.

An example of t-h former, to my mind, is his record- ing of Bruckners Fourth Symphony with the London Sym- phony Orchestra. He does not appear to \"do\" anything, apart from faithfully following the score and securing first-rate orchestral playing, and the result is magnifi- cent. Last night, on the other hand. his skilful, unobstrusive devoted musicianship continually: for me, stopped short of illumina tion, and I wished he would do something-though I must admi: that when he did (as for instance, the drawing out and underlining of important chords here and there in the Great C major Symphony) I did not like it. In the G minor Symphony of Mozart, K.550, finely played and meticulously conducted, the fire obstinately refused to descend. It was good but ultimately uninterest- ing. Everything was there except the life-enhancing rhythm, the touch that can quicken a phrase so that it suddenly catches at your heart-strings. Or am I merely con- fessing that I have heard the work too many times and need an exag- gerated interpretation to stimulate my overloaded reflexes ? It seemed to me that the curiously plodding and unsyncopated effect. of the Minuet was an undoubted objec tive fact. But in such cases one is driven back on cloudy generalisa tions to justify a vague but per sistent impression. The Schubert did not seem to be really any better. This is admittedly Sa work which, in my experience, very few conducto-s measure up to (Beecham, Toscanini. latterly lemperer) and in which many fall ruinously as Kertesz certinly did not. There was little to quarrel with, apart from the occasional over-emphasis already referred to, and much to enjoy in his lucid, no nonsense approach to a work that conductors are apt to wallow in Sunashamedly. S In the main section of the first Smovement the tempos. So often Sbungled, were so nearly right that * it was surprising be did -not get. . them quite right instead of setting a pace which obliged him to slow up slightly for the second subject t (though he sensibly retained this reduced tempo more or less con- f stantly thereafter) and in the pIA 1 moto coda accelerating to a speed I which was just too fast to allow the final statement of the opening A theme to be played in tempo. But A in general the care and zest and e judgment of it all were exemplary. SIt was simply that the grandeur, '\" the great driving momentum. the Pt heroic temper, the huge energy, e the \"heartbreaking show of spirit s in adversity\" (as Tovey calls the . tune of the second movement) rk were missing. That at least was my impression. SWhat can hardly be disputed was d the admirable quality of the play ing which Kertesz obtained from the LSO throughout last night's - concert and which added fresh s distinction to a wonderful year at Sthe Proms-a quality that was r sustained in six .of Mahler's Knaben Wunderhorn songs (sung e by Sybil Michelow and John y Shirley-Quirk), though these are a, not pieces that go well in the o Albert Hall.",

   "text_content" : "by CLEMENT CRISP Three ballets in the programme instead of one is welcome news 'from Festival Ballet, after a sum- mer of swans and quaint old Flemish jollification. Last night, after the obligatory ballet blanc opening-a polite but blank Les Sylphides-we settled down to the serious and pleasing business of good ballets and good dancing. Festival Ballet are in need of Sstrong, short works, and though the acquisition of the lamented London Dance Theatre's artistic direction last autumn suggested that we might see some fruits from the merger rather earlier than we have, Sit is better late than never that Janine Charrat's exciting Phkdre, one of LDT's best creations, has - now arrived to embellish the Festival season. It is a ballet., boasting a fine score from Wilfred Josephs, equally good ddcor by Philip Tomasi, and eminently effective choreography. The sure way that Charrat has mingled private passion with public performance, the cun- ning use of Racine's drama S(cheated only by Phbdre's hanging herself, though this seems an almost essential coup de thddire), and the skilful characterisation- with a narcissistic Hippolyte, and an Oenone who is both confidante and dresser to Phbdre-all make for compelling ballet. The work receives sure per- formances from the whole cast, notably Alain Dubreuil's Hyppo- lite, and Galina Samtsova's Phbdre. If Miss Samtsova as yet lacks the dry, feverish passion of Belinda Wright's creation, she compensates largely by the strength of her dancing; indeed the evening was dominated by her performances here and in the pre- ceding Corsaire pas de deux which she and Andr6 Prokovsky dashed through with huge enjoyment much to the audience's delight. Finally Harald Lander's Etudes. long time a delight in the company repertory, and still as grandly effec- tive as ever. The ennobling dis- ciplines of ballet class are magni- ficently set out, the mounting vir- tuosity of the piece is well done by Carmen Math,. John Gilpin and Prokovsky, and the real qualities of Festival Ballet's personnel, for too long obscured under feathers and peasant costume, are at last to be properly appreciated again.",

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON The Bach week-end at Long Melford, an offshoot of the Aldeburgh Festival, is in its fifth year and firmly established to judge from the audience that illed Sthe large church on Saturday after- noon to hear the St. John Passion conducted by Benjamin Britten. * Opportunities to hear Britten con* duct a major work of Bach's are rare. They are to be seized Seagerly On Saturday the music, Britten's Interpretation and the un- usual and splendid setting so interacted on one another as to produce an experience of Saltogether unusual quality. The forces used were about those of Bach's day, the Ambro- sian Singers if anything sligtly outnumbered by the Englis Chamber Orchestra (unless there was an invisible and therefore Suncountable row at the front of Sthe choir-it was hard to aee). Long Melford Church is surpris. ingly free from unwanted Sresonance. Bristten's hoir and Sorchestra illed it with dry, clear Ssound ideally matched to his urgent tempt, buoyant rhythms r, instrumental textures pullat. n* with life, Bach's life, always there but normally obscured by Sheavy slnging and dull playlng.

This is certainly ivrue of Rembrandt and a study of the writings about bhimn ould prove most illuminat- ing. This has bee done for the period 16301730 by Professor SSlive, but the story needs felling Sdown to our time. it For instacti. the type of dramal Stic early picture which appealed ito a distinguished connoisseur and Scollector, such as Constantin Huy- t shens, in Rembrandt's own time a does not necessarily excite his - modern counterpart. Thus Sir A Kenneth Clark in his stimulating i Rembrandt and the Italian Renals- : sance (John Murray, 63s) makes i the point that a number of the t artist's early anti-classical paint- d ings are among \" the most unpleas- Sing, not to say disgusting, pictures ever produced by a great artist.\" SThere is much id what he says but , it could be argued that the very i delight in ugliness and the cult of e violence evident in such works i) gives them a special meaning for many in our own period. .. Sir Kenneth's examination of the a early Rembrandt, the Jacobean y. artist, as it were. sets the stage for I his search for the connections be- s tween Rembrandt and Italian b Renaissance art. It is a subject t about which he is particularly well s qualified to write. Although the Stheme has tempted other writers, g none has hitherto treated it in such n depth and so skilfully. The result e is a highly enjoyable and intrigu- .e ing book; Sir Kenneth, as hardly requires emphasis, has the art to enable the reader to see what he sees in art. He refers in his open- ing chapter to Professor Living- stone Lowes's celebrated analysts of Coleridge's Kubla Khan and his own volume will have the same honoured place on the shelves. His argument, shortly put, is that Rembrandt, dissatisfied' with the conventional academism of his time, both in its baroque and clas- sical manifestations, turned to the simplicity and concentration of nd pre-mannerist art. It provided him te with a basis of design which per- :e mitted him to present the truth with great directness. It was a ,. quest which inevitably made him St look with close attention at the ,0 great artists of the Italian Renais- a, sance. Francols Perrer engraving of antique relief However, he never visited Italy. This is not as paradoxical as it I sounds. In the mid-17th century, i Holland was the centre of a con- Iiderable art trade and a number of important Italian pictures came . on to the market. For example, in 1639 he was able to see two i mtasterpieces of Italian art in the Lopez sale in Amsterdam-Titian's ] Portrait of a Man (National Gal- i lery) and Raphael's Portrait of 1 CastiRlione. He combined the poses i of both pictures in his etched self- portrait of 1639. What is more, Rembrandt, like many other painters (Vermeer was Sanother), supplemented his earn- ings by art-dealing. Sir Kenneth t has wisely reprinted the famous S1659 inventory of Rembrandt's s possessions which shows the con- Ssiderable number of works by e Dutch and Italian artists which f were in his house. n Sir Kenneth's investigations are * greatly assisted by the layout of h his book which enables a point a to be made visually, so that, to i take one instance, we can im- e mediately graps how drawings such Sas the sketches* after Raphael's UMndnnna deFan Smdin influenrrd his conceptions. The passages on Rembrandt's drawings and: the problems of their authenticity are particularly instructive. Due attention is paid to the role of prints in enriching Rembrandt's imagination. Thus it can be seen how the grand design of Leonardo's Last Supper, as available to Rembrandt in a print, lies behind several of his pictures. including the great late Rembrandt of Claudius Civills. Sir Kenneth's argument is most persuasive that Rembrandt had a Ssight of. the manuscript of Leonardo's Trattato. which was in i the hands of the German painter Sandrart who was in Amsterdam Sfrom 1637-41. Classical sculpture was also r available in Holland and Rem- i brandt himself owned a cast of the Laocoon. To my mind, one of the Sm6st exciting quotations which Sir e Kenneth has traced concerns the t genesis of the Bathsheba in the I Louvre. He points out that this :s * derived from engravings after I antique reliefs in Frangois Perrier's s Icones et Segmenta, published in s Paris in 1645. So, he observes, 'these crude engravings of third ate artefacts helped to inspire one ,f the most beautiful pictures in he world simply because they :ould transmit a system of design erfected in the fifth century BC., he great form-determining period if the European mind.\" The chapter on Rembrandt's lebt to the Quattrocento is IUuminating. Sir Kenneth analyses he relationship with. Mantegna Rembrandt owned his engravings) ind Carpaccio. Of course, at.the hÃ½ads of a less sensitive inter- preter the description of such analogies could prove ham-fisted; all depends on the delicacy of the interpretation. What we are faced with, in fact, is a lucid exposition of the way in which a great artist transmritted his sources into his own majestic works and, by doing so, insight is given into the mysteries of the creative process. It is interesting to compare this book with the account of Rem- brandt provided by Messrs. Rosenberg and Slive in their Dutch Art and Architecture 1600-1800 (the sedtion on architecture is by E. H, ter Kuile) published in the Pelican History of Art (Â£5 5s Od). It is one that deserves every praise for the concise and serious way in which the various stages in his evolution are examined and, since the aim is not imaginative interpre- tation the occasional flatness of the writing should iot be held against it It offers, indeed, a most compe- tent history of Dutch art during its golden period. The balance is well preserved between the famous and less so. In this respect, much in- terest is attached to the chapters dealing with the Italianate land- scapists. The latest research has been carefully drawn on 'for the text: due attention also is paid to the political and religious back- ground.",

   "text_content" : "Superficially, Little Malcolm seems an ideal play for young players. All its five parts are young parts, students, to be specific, at Huddersfield Tech. who unite under the leadership of their self-appointed Fuehrer, Malcolm Scrawdyke, to raise the standard of Dynamic In- surrection. It is a marvellous play. and the London theatregoers who let it disappear from, the Garrick in February after two thinly- patronised weeks will have a black mark against them in my book for a l9ng time Let any of them who have seen the light since then come to the Royal 'Court They won't see a production in the same street as that at the Garrick, but the National Youth Theatre succeeds in revealing the heart of the play, and this is something to be grate- ful for. To recapitulate briefly, the story concerns a discontented student who is chucked out of art school and decides to assuage the hurt to his self-esteem by organising a secret society, ostensibly to seize political power, but actually to revenge himself on a society that fails to give him enough apprecia. tion. As the plans for his ridicu- lous coup go forward-he and his fellow conspirators are to steal a Stanley Spencer from the local art gallery and compel the head of the art school to destroy it so that they can blackmail him afterwards-we see the game becoming horrifyingly real. Nazism is being born before our eyes. The movement ~lickers out because the author, David Halli- well, has made his Fuehrer a weak character who fails to act when the scheduled moment arrives. Timothy Dalton, who plays Malcolm, has made this weak- ness a little too obvious. It is revealed mostly in the soliloquies that break up the action from time to time; but Mr. Dalton allows Malcolm's emotions to master him even when the other members of ihe movement are there. He becomes helplessly hysterical, for instance, when presiding at the miock trial of one of them, which turns creepily into a real trial; and he is clearly terrified out ot his life after the scene in which they savage a girl who has tried to break up the plot. What he has done is to take too literally the words that Malcolm speaks. Malcolm is in love with words, and he is capable of expressing emotions that he does ot wholly feel. With his theatrical estures, Mr. Dalton has made him less of a politician than an actor. None the less, it is a vastly promis- Ing performance, and this boy's mobile face and dark good looks could take him far. Anthony May. as Wick, the Rudolf Hess of the conspiracy, is probably an even better actor, though he has a less punishing part to cope with. The gradual inienc tion of hardnest into -his nice but excessively volatile character is subtly done. and he speaks better than anyone in the company. The other two conspirators are less complex figures. Irwin, the big simpleton who is hardly able to finish a coherent sentence, but who represents that sinister element in any political uprising, the man who goes along with it although he doesn't really believe in it, is com- petently played by Malcolm Storry; and Nipple, the helpless fantasist. is given an able performance by Barrie Rutter, though some of his vowels are so modified that I couldn't always hear what he was saying. It was not his fault, I think, that he was allowed to overplay his part so much at times. It is a charac- teristic of Michael Croft's direction throughout that the emotions are too close to the surface, and there is too much juvenile fooling about with goose steps and so on. After all, these chaps aren't schoolboys. they're boys of 20 or so, and Malcolm at any rate takes himself too seriously to see his scheme turned into a romp, even in private. However. I don't want to be captious. This is the first time the National Youth Theatre has tried its hand at a modern play; and though Little Malcolm is by no means as easy for young players as it looks, they haven't done at all badly, Certainly it deserves the fullest support.",

She entered the ballroom of Act 2 with some- thing of the same wonder that Pontey brings to this entrance In Ashton' version. VIkulov, until then playing an arrogant, confl. dent youth, lookd' at her, fell in love; and together they danced the pas de dexi with a quiet rapt ecstasy that had more emotion In it than the other interpreters had shown.

   "text_content" : "by f1SN WRIGHT Nearly everyosr at' . WAu HIaIt last wirk weed that it was a delight to return to sanity and matches luatin three ours of let, irttrUly hUose of us who ndured the dreary strokeiaY hreesomes lasting five and aha hours at the Carling event the week previously. Nearly everyone, that is, except the players taking part in the 54th POA Matchplay Cham- pionship' sponsored by the News ob the Wortd. Whether one regards these wellt paid performers as extremely for tunate to earn their large rewards in such a pleasurable manner or: more realistically, shudders at th- thought of one's bread and butter depending perhaps fresuently on putts of a yard or less, it is a trifle tiresome to listen so often to the complaints of our professional golfers. But on this occasion the rumblings of discontent about the method of prize distribution appear to have been amply justi fled and I make no apologles for introducing the subject of financ to this column. Take, for instance, the case of George Will, the Sun- dridge Park professional. He was eliminated from the championship on Friday morning, having played five rounds of golf, two of them in the 36-holes qualifying competi- tion. For this is reward was a cheque for Â£58 10s, less than hair the sum received by the man he beat in the first round, Jimmy Hume. of Formby. Hume earned Â£122 17s 6d b- cause he finished runner-up in the qualifying competition, won by Clive Clark. Likewise Clark de- parted atter two rounds of the championship roper richer by Â£268 2s 6d. Some Â£200 of this was his qualifying prize, Â£50 more than the prize for the best round in that competition-his record of 6- on the Old Course-and another Â£25 for surviving one round of match-play. Shillings and pence come into all these calculations because the PGA deducts 2% pe- cent. of all winnings. * Clark .was beaten by Bernard Hunt (Hartsbourne), who duli reached the quarter-finals, onl) then to allow Peter Alliss (Park stone) to wriggle off the hook Four down with four holes to play 0 Alliss eventually won an extra ordinary match at the 26th hole Hunt took home Â£97 10s for hi! Spains, and doubtless these wen considerable, and Alliss, beaten ii Saturday morning sem-finals, a mere Â£243 15s. So in Britain's premier match- play event it is more profitable to win the strokeplay preliminaries and be knocked out in your nrst match than to battle through seven rounds of golf to the semi-finals-- a ludicrous situation. But the system of distribution of , . the Â£1,706 Ss allotted to the finalists was scarcely less absurd- Â£1,218 IS to the winner, Peter Thomson, of Australia, who took the title of British Matchplay Champion for the third time; Â£487 10s to Neil Coles (Coombe Hill), the runner-up, whose hopes -of winning this title three times in succession were thus dashed. It is fairly common knowledge that in this type of event the finalists more often than not agree to split equally the prize money- before the final. Such ridiculously top-heavy distribution virtually forces them into this iniquitous practice, by which the public is sometimes deceived into thinking 4 that hundreds of pounds could hinee on the tiniest of putts. SOn to more pleasing aspects of the week, during which Thomson Sdemonstrated a quality not re- Squired of him when winning his I five British Open championships. 1 I have never seen him hit so many Sdownright poor golf shots, nor putt with less inspiration. He has been I troubled all the year by muscle I strains in the right hand and wrist, Sand seldom been able to display the serene, almost mechanical shot Sproduction one has come to expect a of him. But the hallmark of the Sgreat golfer 'is his ability to , scramble when his best form a deserts him. And Thomson y scrambled like a demon when fully s extended by a succession of e mediocre opponents he would n normally have brushed aside. It 4 was a wonderfully impressive per- r formance, as was that of Coles in ,f reaching the final. e Few of the iron men who com- is pete in professional golf at its r highest level can give their all, as Coles did at the Carling tourna- d ment, and hope to retain their y form all through the week follow- y ing. Unfortunately Coles lost his c- form at the vital moment in the c. final. But all praise to him for a y, great fortnight's work. Why he s. should be such a dangerous com- e. petitor only in the second half of is the season, however, is as much a re mystery to him as it is to everyone in else."
