Despite the remark by Mr. Bowden yesterday that he was \" a little more hopeful,\" it is probable that the British party will leave for London late to-morrow night or early on Tuesday. This is because Mr. Bowden will discover to-morrow- at his next meeting with Mr. Smith-whether there is any point in his staying longer. at this is necessary. but it seems As one official put it to me: that Mr. Bowden is still waiting for The British team has been \" waiting for the sticking-point.\" Mr. Bowden and the Attorney- General, Sir Elwyn Jones, spent to-day relaxing, after attending morning church with the Governor. Sir Humphrey Gibbs. Explanation for Optimism Up to now neither side, for reasons of its own, has been in a burry to accept that the deadlock still exists; this reticence has been the real explanation of the opti- mism that has been coming out of Salisbury. Mr. Bowden's task has been a double one. First, he has been following the brief of the Commonwealth con- ference communiqud and has been spelling out the British Govern- ment's intentions to \"all sections of opinion in Rhodesia.\" Second, he has evidently taken the opportunity to make the most serious bid since November to find a settlement. Everyone who has met him is cpniyiscq that, whatever Londog Iay say. he s \" ngoatin.\" Bu it is almost equally certain that no real progreus has been made. There is no sign of any \" give\" by the Rhodesian regime and British hopes that Mr. Smith him. self might be prepared to do a deal-and sell it to the Rhodesian rublic-if only he could be isolated from his own right-wing, are likely to prove as illusory as they have always done. Search for Cabinet \"'Moderate\" The search for a \"moderate,' within the Rhodesian Cabinet has always turned out to be a red herring and the British Ministers are probably making a mistake It they think Mr. Smith himself will fill the role. Mr. Bowden has now completed both these tasks, because over the past week he has met almost every. one, with one very important ex- ception-he has not yet been allowed by Mr. Smith to meet the restricted African Nationalist leaders. Mr. Smith has been told Mr. Wilson By Our Poll Sir Morrice James, the senior Commonwealth Office official re- cently returned from Salisbury, reported to the Prime Minister at Downing Street yesterday on last week's talks between Mr. Ian Smith and the Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Herbert Bowden. The meeting lasted 1' hours. It is not yet known when Sir Morrice will return to Rhodesia or now long Mr. Bowden and the Attorney*Oeneral, Sir Elwyn Jones, will remain In Salisbury. What is being emphasised in Whitehall, however, is that the British position remains (nohanned after the first round of talks. anross had been r.ade should also th treated with caution. Flegnallty., Mr. Smith has returned from his Rhodesian Front Con- grass In Bulawayo more assured than ever of the plaudits of his supporters. He has been assured from the floor that he has \"the timilityons have of a Schweiton er, the te impact of a Churchill and the sim- lcity onferea Lincoln.\" This s heady stuff for any Prime Minister and it it undeniably believed by many Front members. It should be added that there are still many Rhodesissued whoby thinke Britis re- mark the biggest joke of the week. gets report ticii Reporter There will still be insistence on the Six Princimples-notay bythe first, which requires unims talkinged proseriss to majority rule, and the ifth, which requires a solution to be accepring to theembarrassm people of Rhodesia as a whole, It is claimed that Mr. Smith is well aware of the British Govern. ment's attitude. and his comment that a solution of the crisis might be near should be seen against this background. In other words, It is one Smith who will have to show himself willin to negotiate on the hasis of the S Prinoiples and n the Brit all Government whicthe will have to compromise on them UK. have to compromise on them. an answer. Clearly, the Commonwealth Secretary cannot wait for ever, now thct there are no other meetings left to fill in the time, and always provided there is no real chance of an agreement on a return to legality. And it must be repeated that there is no hard evidence, as distinct from hopeful conjecture, that any such chance exists. However, the fact that negotia- tions have been going on this last week is a fascinating comment on the impact of the Commonwealth Conference. It may be coincidence or it may be waste of time. but the immediate result of the \" ultima- tum \" issued by the British Government under Commonwealth pressure and dismissed with apparent complacency by Rhodesia is that Mr. Smith is talking seri- ously to a British Minister and suffering the embarrassment of that Minister sitting in Government House interviewing almost every- one he wants to see. No Mandate from the Front But it all goes back to the will- ingpess or ability of the two sides to reach a dcmpromise. The U.K. 'Government's thinking alay, be opaque, but from here the attitudb of the Rhodesian Front is very clear indeed-Mr. Smith has never had less of a mandate to renegoti- ate Rhodesia's independence. As for the report of growing optimism in Salisbury, it would be unwise to read too much into Mr. Bowden's comment that he was a little more hopeful than when he arrived.

Iihe men, employea by the Longbndge ciroup of Delivery Agents which handles most of the production from BMC's Austin factory, voted overwhelmingly in favour of an immediate strike which they call on their union, the Transport and General Workers' Union. to declare official. The meeting had been told that the employers had rejected a proposal for work-sharing and had gone ahead with the issuing of notices to 333 of the 649 drivers. Alternate Weeks The work-sharing proposal put forward by the union on Friday had suggested that the men should work alternate weeks and draw unemployment pay on the weeks on which they were not employed.

   "_id" : "FTDA_1966_0926_0001_015",
   "text_content" : "it has taken the market five years to realise that Coats Patons is not a growth stock. The effect on the share price, helped by the general setback and the chairman's succinct re- marks about Whether the divi- dend could be held, have com- bined to cut the share price from the 40s-50s range of recent years to 34s 3d. The yield now is 7.9 per cent. and the p/e 10.7 times so at last the share price is coming to grips with the problems. World wide Coats is a classic example of a group that has been, and still is, enormously successful world-wide at one thing, making sewing thread. Moreover, it has been in this poai- lion for a long time. It lost Â£2.4m. of plant and equipment on account of the Russian Revolution at the end of the First World War, and at the end of the Second World War a similar sum was stripped off the group by the expropriAtion of the factoriek in Hungary, Bul- garia. Yugoslavia, and so on. he group's problem is crystallised by these examples. Coats was a major international group in 1914 and ever since it has beed' losing its sewing thread world markets as, inevitably, new nations set up n textiles first. Thus in Coats itself, which is mainly sewing thread, and contri. butes around Â£15m. of the group's Â£21m. of profits before tax, the outlook is defensive and has been that way for some time. The aim is to maintain margins on sales (a respectable 15.4 per cent. for the group overall) to justify the high ratio of capital employed- Â£137m.-to sales of Â£155m. Nor is there any obvious scope for sud- denly improving thread profits. An obvious move would be to absorb English Sewing Cotton which has an estimated .30-40 per cent. of the U.K. thread market. The competition here must exag- gerate Coats' need to carry the enormous stocks it does-Â£72m. But the problem is that ESC owns American Thread. Coats also has sub-W1bII ndip toe business there, accounted for a ifth of net assets and 18 per cent. of group profits. The drawback is that these two businesses can never be put together because of a consent decree in 1914 with the U.S. anti-trust authorities. Taking over ESC therefore would merely bring up the crucial problem of disposing of American Thread into unfriendly hands. First Step The difficulties then are quit. clear. Thread profits are massive and have the virtue of being steady as a result of the group's dominat ing position. But they are no mor: than that which means Coats has 10 look elsewhere for growth. Patons and Baldwins was the first real step in this direction when It was taken over in 1961. It is big, profits of around Â£4%m. before tax last year, but not unfortunately a growth point. Knitting wools have run into problems with the growth of acrylics and wool price movements can have a nasty effect on profits. Pasolds on the other hand, though bought a little too early, profits dropped last year when for the first time the group found it had more than enough productive capacity to meet demand, was plainly a step in the right direction. The children's clothing market is worth Â£150m. a year and Pasold's with 7 per cent. of it at the moment rightly reckons it can take more.. But really it needs more than that to jolt group profits into action. Coats only has 54 per cent. of Pasolds which means that even if Pasolds' profits double the effect on group profits is an increase of just 3.6 per cent. Thus if more growth is the aim it will have to be bought. The trouble is that aim conflicts with the cash shortage. At the end of last year the net over- draft was Â£7%m. and cash flow under corporation tax is Â£7.3m. compared with a capital pro. gramme of over Â£8%m. There is scope for more gearing of course since overdrafts and loans are only Â£15.3m. against net assets of Â£115m. and the Preference could presum- ably be exchanged for loan stock (Unilever and Courtaulds style) at a modest saving. In the short term it looks as though the capital programme will be cut before the dividend, but this does not rule out a lower rate as well. There is no point in Coats hanging on to the dividend if this is going to mean endless repetitions on the same theme in future years. If the rate is cut then the share price is not at the bottom, though at say 30s the P/E ratio would be 9.3 times and low enough to stop the rot In the long term Coats has no doubt it will have to go further into the garment industry. But the size of thread profits means that an effort in this direction is bound to take a long time before it moves profits significantly. Grampian Holdings Grampian Holdnlags' share price has dropped fromt 19s 7%d to 9s 9d. so far this ar aits reputa tioli for begurg-,fo fe few hold. ing companies with rising profits has faded away. Nor will its interim statement come to the rescue. On the contrary, profits for the first six months are down from Â£623,000 to Â£522,000 before tax, and it is \" difficult to predict\" that the normal pattern of larger profits in the second half will continue. The only two divisions which are showing higher profits so far are construction and plant hire, and their prospects can hardly be bright in the immediate future. The trouble is, however, that if group pre-tax profits are no better in the second half than in the first, which would suggest a pre-tax total of Â£1.04m. against Â£1.43m., earn. Inge would only barely cover the 20 per cent, dividend rate. But then at its present level to yield 10/4 per cent. and selling at 9.3 times prospective earnings the share price is not expecting much more. See also Page 8",

(the Chairman) pre- aiding. The following is his circulated statement: You will see from the Annual Accounts of our Group that the Trading Profit before taxation was 335,094 compared with Â£321,670 for the previous year. In spite of Government restrictions which resulted in a recession in the Con- struction Industry and notwith- standing higher costs and increased competition we have managed to achieve improved profits both before and after taxation which must, I am sure, be considered satisfactory to all concerned. The year must be regarded as one of consolidation rather than txpansion, and the liquid position of our Group is such that we are well placed to take advantage of any opportunity which presents itself for expanding or diversifying our activities. In my previous statement I out* lined the various activities of the Group Companies and the follow* ing observations are intended to live you a review of the position at the end of the Group financial year and the prospects for the Future. At Houe Sydney Green & Saon (Henley) Limnited, continues to act as a Ser- vice Company to the Group; its main activity is the hire of Plant and Transport to the subsidiary companies. The contribution to the Group Profits amounted to 6 per cent. of the whole. Sydney Green & Sons (Road- ways) Lmhted and Asociated Apliat Compay Limhtd. The resources of both of these com- panies in road surfacing and ancil- lary work were fully committed during the year and contributed 42 per cent. to the Group Profits. I am pleased to be able to state that these companies are fully com- mitted at the present time and the forward position appears satisfac- tory. Sydney Green (Civi Eagaineering) Limited. The activities of this Company are confined to civil engi- 2cering construction work including complete road construction. Its resources have been fully extended during the year and there was a satisfactory expansion both in the value of work completed and profits. This subsidiary contributed 50 per centL to the Group Profits. Soi Eng&neering Contracting Company ited. The freehold property referred to in my last statement has now been sold at a satisfactory price and a portion of the 20 acres of gravel bearing land has been sold to our associate Company, Handy Cross Gravel Ltd., for use on the High Wycombe By-pass: contract. The remainder will be developed as opportunity permits. The trading activities of this Company have been taken over by the other trading subsidiaries in the Group as appropriate so it has made nb contribution to the Group Profits. Sydney Green (Building) Limited. Considerable difficulties were ex' perienced during the year with ouspig velopment due to the Government's' credit restrictions and in consequence it was decided to cut back the Company's activi- ties. The Group owns valuable building land and I am confident that on a return to normal condi-, tions it will show adequate. rewards for our past efforts. It contributed 6 per cent. to the Group Profits. Gravel Products (Hunts) Limited and Paxton Developments Limited. Due to the contraction in the con- struction industry there was a certain falling off in sales and profits. The new processing plant has now been completed, planning permission has been granted on an additional 400 acres of gravel bearing land adjoining the existing workings and I am confident that this Company will make a valu- able contribution in future years. During the year under review it was responsible for some 12 per cent. of the Group Profits, Motorway Joint Ventures. The High Wycombe By-pass contract No. 1 has continued to prove dis- appointing mainly due to variable weather conditions and to difficulty In obtaining suitable materials. All known losses on this contract at the year-end have been taken Into account in the figures as presented and subiect to unforeseen circum- stances and weather conditions It is not anticipated that further siii nficant losses should arise in completing this project. The earth' works, which have proved a most difficult operation. are now virtu- ally finished and the bridges are completed with the exception of final finlishngs. The remainder of the pavement and ancillary works should be completed by next July. The loss brought Into the accounts after adjlutments for previous loint ventures is cauivalent to 16 per cent, of the Group Profit figure. Fields A Pateman Limited. The transaction set out under \" Puture Developments\" in my statement last year was successfully con cluded. In accordance with the terms as set out therein. at the end of August. 1965. The contrif bution which this acquisition has made to the Group Profits for the year under review is insignlficant but it is hoped that following the reorganilation which is now in hand, the garage business wilt make a wothwhile contribution in the future in addition to the long- term potential of the freehord property and land.

Your Directors are also actively pursuing the possibility of securing a foothold in Australia where the long-term prospects appear to be particularly favourable.

City and Guilds Institute for the I award of its Diploma. It is antici- . ated that the first Road Works - Course for which all vacihcies have now been filled should start by I the beginning of September. es Tazatlom Although it is difficult to assess the full effects of the. changes in F) the basis of Company taxation, it r- is estimated that, as predicted in 1s my Statement last year, the Group It liability to tax for the year under y review will be at a lower level than 0O hitherto. 6 It is a great disappointment that the Government should have d' thought fit to include the construc- tion industry under the heading of e \"service industries\" whereby it bears the full impact of the Selec- Stive Employment Tax. Far from hoarding labour, the construction v industry has suffered practically ever since the last War, from a at shortage of skilled and unskilled \" labour due to the more arduous e conditions of working when com- pared with those generally prevail- ing in the manufacturing industries. ) The imposition of this tax is not 's only bound to lead to an increase :' in prices but is also going to put g our Group at a disadvantage when d tendering for overseas work because the planning, research and develop- a ment is done in this country by id staff who will attract the Selective d Employment Tax. Dividend Although an interim dividend of 15 per cent. was paid this year st under the transitional provisions a of the Finance Act 1965, it is not As necessarily the intention to do this Ad every, year in view of the additional te expense involved. Your Directors el had intended proposing an in- e creased dividend this year but in er response to the Government's re- ty quest they recommend restricting 3 the final dividend to 5 per cent .r making a total of 20 per cent. for in the year, which is the same as last year. 'p Finally, I would like to thank my Co-Directors for the support which d. they have given me throughout the x' year and the Executives, staff and th employera of the Group \"for iheir Ih continued efforts which have pro- Is duced such a satisfactory result in ! spite of the difficult conditions 'n encountered. ole The report and accounts were at adopted.",

   "text_content" : "The SIXTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of Man- chester Liners Limited was held at the registend office of the Company, St. Ann's Squie, Manchester. on' September 23. - The following is the statement by the Chairman, MR. KENNETH STOKER, M.A. J.P.. which had been circulated with,the report and accounts for the year ended 30th June. 1966: I stated in the Interim Report sent to Shareholders on the 18th March that because of the nature of ship-owning and the inhereni hazards of labour difficulties it should be appreciated half-yearly figures cannot always be considered indicative of the results for a full year. Unhappily my warning was prophetically accurate. This country experienced in May and June forty-six days of a seamen's strike which has contributed to the present disastrous economic state of the Nation. Coinciding with this misfortune your Company has also been hard hit by a prolonged longshoremen's strike in Canada. The losses incurred as a resull of these two strikes are included in the Balance Sheet in steamers' current accounts and therefore are not reflected in the 1966 Surplus from Trading. As the strikes were called off by the 30th June, yout Directors decided that provision ol Â£210,000 should be made for the losses incurred and credited to next year's Profit and Loss Account. All will be familiar with the course which the seamen's strike took and all will know that the Pearson Committee of Enquiry found that same was not justified, What is not known is what the commercial consequences will be and its ultimate effect on the Nation's economy. As was to be expected, like other Lines we have lost business to our foreign compe titors and our immediate concern is to win it back. Also as a direci result it has not been possible this year to reserve any amount foi Fleet Replacement, which. as I have explained before, is necessary each year so that funds are avail able to build new competitive ships as the older units come to the end of their useful life. The Accounts The Accounts show a reductios in the Surplus from Trading from Â£356,386 to Â£260,304 and this occurs despite increased care carryings. The dividend on the Ordinary Share Capital has beer maintained at ten per cent (paid as an Interim Dividend on March 31st), and the balance carried for ward has increased from Â£97.884 to Â£119,447. The remaining items follow the pattern of-former years and call for no special comment. The fall in profits stems from a number of reasons, the main ones being increased operating expenses which mount each year and were accentuated by the seamen's wage award,. in-April, .1965..* the- high initial cost of new ships, and thn -law turn-aroundin U.K. ports due to shortage of labour. Circumr stances. however, did not permit an equivalent increase in freight rates and to add to our discomfort when ships were held up we had to charter additional tonnage in a market where charter rates have been abnormally high. Further. more due to these lengthy delays we had to abandon a joint service with the Bristol City Line out ol Manchester and Avonmouth tc New York and United States South Atlantic ports. You will realise therefore that it has been all im portant to speed up the movemeni or cargo through the ports, and the first step to this end was taken b\\ the management of the Port ol Manchester when they introducec a rebate system on cargo presentec to them on pallets or in unitisec form. This imaginative and prac tical idea, I am glad to say, hat had encouraging results. Container caution You will have read much aboul the new Container Age in the Press. We are the first BMttis company to start in a modesi way a Container service to Chicago in conjunction with a new Customs' approved container. clearing depot in Manchester, From our limited experience In this field we realise that much more careful study, research and experiment will be needed before a full appreciation can be gained of how to achieve the best results., As the recent White Paper on Transport Policy has emphasised, the movement oi exports is not simply a port's oi a shlpowner's problem: Improve ments are needed all along the line, Including handling in the factory or depot, For our part we are continuing to increase our own productivity and have ordered two new vessels for delivery this Autumn, designed Sarticularly for speeding the anndling of unitised cargo and suitably ice-trengthertd Tor the inaugsturation of our first winter 'argo service direct to Montrual. In all our forward thinking the management of the Port of Man- chestpr has given us the ftllest collatoratio and we are indebtid to them for their Inteoret and Idonl. As I write theu words we are In the midst of probahly the uloomlsl nierind of ther conoml. history of this country. It 1: hardly the atmosphere In which to make an encouraging forecast, but let us recognin that World trade is expanding year hv vear. and that your Company is In good heart and aulpped to meet the challenge of ever Incroeaing cnmnltition.

The follpwing is his circulated statement: As you' may be aware. Mr. A. C. S. Irwin tendered his resigna- tion as Chairman of your Com- pany in February 1966, and I was invited to take the oifice.- It was due largely to the efforts of Mr. Irwin that the introduction of new management and reconstruction of the Board were possible. We are happy that Mr. Irwin has consented to remain a Director of the Com- pany. Mr. E. R. Heaton, F.A.I., and Mr. 0. E. Fisher, F.C.A., (who has been Secretary since 1960) have both been appointed to the Board since the last Annual General Meet. ing the former in the capacity of Managitig Director. Following the death of Mr. R. B. Price, a director, early in 1965, and by reason of the impend- ing retirement of Mr. W. J. Cale, who as the original Managing Director had been instrumental in building the Group, it became appatent that a large block of shares in the Company would be available for sale. An offer was made by Milbury ,Holdings Limited, a private company based on Manchester, with somewhat similar trading interets to Oldeani, for the purchase of these shares. The offer was subject to a condi- tion that Milbury were able to acquire one million shares in all. and in order to meet this require- ment, Mr. Irwin agreed to make up any deficiency from his own hold- ing providing Milbury extended their offer to all shareholders. Following the above Mr. A. M. Haworth and myself, both of us directors and shareholders in Mil- bury, were appointed to the Board of your company, and a little later Mr. R. J. Newcombe, F.R.I.C.S., who is also a director of Milbury joined us. Tradig Results The year 1965 did not produce the results that had been antici- pated, the main obstacle (as with 1964) being the non-completion by target dates of various develop- ments. Had it not been for certain profitable sales of land, Group trading results would have been less than the Â£67,448 finally realised. An area of land owned by a sub- sidiary investment company was acquired by a local authority at a price which showed a surplus of Â£145,887. This represents a capital profit and it is the intention of your Board to utilise it in expanding Group activities. Shareholders may remember that we had a number of flats under construction. and it was our inten, tion to let them, but because of conditions brought about by the Rent Act 1965 this policy has been changed and all flats completed or under construction are now being sold. Expansion Programme Continually .increasing land prices which have been particularly noticeable in the Midlands. our area of operations, mean that we must plan substantial increases in output for future years if we are to maintain growth in the face of the reduced margins that must be expected. However, even after our 1966 programme is completed we shall have sufficient land available from present stocks to continue our planned expansion for a further two years. We are constantly seek- ing suitable replenishment of land stocks and will if necessary widen the area of our activities although the effect of the proposed Land Commission Act and fluctuations in the availability of Building Society finance make precise for- ward planning difficult. Until the end of 1965 our Invest* ment income of approximately Â£31.000 per annum was almost ex- clusively derived from ground rents on private dwellings. We have since acquired modern shop properties producing rents of Â£10,000 per annum and further acauisitions will be made as suit. able opportunities arise. Share- holders will recollect that under our arrangement with Royal Ex- change Assurance we are able to borrow on mortgage to support such purchases. It is probable that, under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1965, Oldeani is a close company. It would seem, however, that even if the close company provisions do apply they have no real signifi- cance in our case. Dividend In order that the company would not be treated unfavour- ably for taxation purposes, two interim dividends in respect of the year ended 31st December 1965, were paid before 6th April 1966, to ordinary shareholders. After payment of the proposed final divi- dend of 8% the total distribution in respect of 1965 will be 25% compared with 30% for the pre- vious year. Following payment of this final dividend the deferred ordinary shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares and application will be made to the Stock Exchange London and The Birmingham Stock Exchange for the quotation at present given to be extended to cover the whole of the company's issued share capital. The cost of a dividend at the rate of 25% will, in future years. increase by Â£31,250. as a result of the present deferred ordinary shares ranking for dividend. Prospects Your company has passed through an unfortunate period, but I think we can now look forward to better things. The effect of various policy changes will not be fully realised until 1967, but results for 1966 so far lead me to believe that we shall certainly be able to maintain the dividend at 25% even with the deferred ordinary shares ranking for dividend. IYour directors have explored with the Board of Milbury Hold- ings Limited whether and to what extent it would be profitable for the two companies to work together or to integrate certain of their activities, and the subject has now been referred to their respec- tive financial advisers. I hope to let you have some further informa- tion within the next few months. The report and accounts were unanimously adopted and the other formal business duly transacted.",

   "text_content" : "Bank Rate 7% (July 14, 1966) Discount houses met with a further shortage of credit in Lombard Street yesterday, and the authorities gave a small amount of assistance, by buying bills from the banks. A rate of 6J per cent. was ordinarily bid for day- to-day loans, with 64 per cent. paid for \" made \" money and on occasion for other lines. Late balances, how- ever, were obtained at 54 per cent. Conditions during the week as a whole were difficult, and official assist- ance was required on each day. On Thursday, the help was given in the form of overnight lending at Bank Rate of 7 per cent. At the tender houses submitted an unchanged bid of Â£98 6s 3d for 91-day bills, and the average rate of discount rose 0.36d per cent. to Â£6 I5s 1.50d per cent. December maturities were quoted for sale by houses at 45-64 per cent. Lanr B.ifIi Hn7THileBilf Da- Sh'rt114 S I 4 tod'y prds.lmtbuths mtbh mtli mthbmth Sterling rose just over IA cent against the U.S. dollar last week to a little under 52.79A. In a week of erratic movements, a near eight-week peak of over S2.79A was touched on Wednesday. A strong demand for overnight sterling deposits abroad helped the rise, but it seemed that official purchase, with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York possibly playing a leading part, were an important factor in stimulating buy- ing. The statement on the Rhodesian situation by Mr. Smith also helded to some extent. Forward sterling showed no marked change. Gold was reduced I cent an ounce to S35.171-191 on balance-in spite of the best demand for several months on Wednesday. FOREIGN EXCHANGES Xeg.

   "text_content" : "INTERIM STATEMENTS ~ ._.. __ __ __ -------- LIMITED INTERIM REPORT for six months ended 81st May, 1966 As recently announced the Directors have declared an Interim Dividend of 8%% (5d. per share), less tax. payable on the 30th November 1966 to holders of Ordinary Shares on the Register at the close of business on the 14th October 1966. This dividend is at the same rate as last year. Norcros Limited reports profits after tax for the six months ending the 31st May 1966 of Â£494.000 (Â£496,000). Profits of individual Divisions are shown below. In arriving at these un- audited figures minority interests have been deducted and where subsidiary companies make up accounts to dates other than the 30th November the results for the first six months of these subsidiaries have been utilised.

The reduction in profit of Division C reflects the minority interest now owned by the National Pharmaceutical Union in S. Maw, Son & Sons. The benefits of this association, however, will be felt increasingly by both parties in future months and years. During the six months under review a payment of Â£50,000 was made to terminate a long term Service Contract This pay- ment is not taken into account in the above trading figures. In Division E, Jensen Motors Limited, although not achieving the high level of the first six months of 1965 nevertheless re- covered from the adverse effects of the last half of that year. Despite the failure of the gas supply. which affected alt companies throughout the Midlands in January, and which lost the company some Â£15,000. the results of the twelve months to 31st July 1966 are almost comparable with last year. The circular to Shareholders dated 8th July 1966 set out the details of the purchase of Ward Brooke & Company Limited in March this year. Whilst the Directors took the unusual step of purchasing assets, albeit at substantially below book values, and whilst Ward Brooke hap made losses totalling Â£90.000 in the twelve months ended 31st March 1966. the rate of loss has now been substantially reduced to the point where the figures tabulated under Division B above include a loss of Â£2.000 only for the two months April and May 1966. It is anticipated that this subsidiary will make Â£50.000 before tax for the 8 months ending November 1966; this figure would have been considerably higher had not production been most seriously disrupted by irresponsible wild cat strikes and unofficial labour agitation.

PROSPECTrS Sales of the Group for the first six months showed an increase ho 1.6% over the corresponding period in 1965. Expenses were, however, higher resulting in a decrease In profit before taxation, The contribution to profi of the first half-year is always consider. ably les than that of the second, and much will depend on the level of trade durins the Christmas period. Government policies will probably have an adverse effect on trading, the extent of which cannot at present be asessed. The Company has also to face the problem of Selective Employment Tax and higher finance charges. Taking everything into account, It is anticipated that the profit of the current year will not show any Improvement on the previous year. It has not, since 1939 been the practice of the Company to pay interim dividends, Such a dividend was however paid In March 1966, in order to obtain the benslit of the provisions of the Finance Act, 1965. The payment of an interim dividend will will pay one 9nnual dividend In Maof Grampian Holdings Limited Interim Report > n For Half Year Ended 80th June, i96 The unaudited results, which include one mlnoracquisition by a sublsdiary company, are broadly in line with the expected performance of the various industries withinh the Group. In the two disappointing subsidiary groups mentioned in the 1965 Annual Report, the action taken In Sports has produced better results. In Lighting a further reorganisation of activities has been unavoidable and no Improvement In results in 19M should be looked for at this stage. Hall Electric continues to make satisfactory profits.

Thi brought the cumaulative total commuitents of the three orgai fl*ia #&Plas1 1i.0 __ These figures are given in the reports of the bank, the IDA and the IFC, which are being presented to-day by Mr. George D. Woods, president of the three institutions, to the annual meeting of the Board of governors in Washington. For 1965-66, the World Bank commitment of S839m. (37 loans) compared with SI.023m. for the previous year, while the Inter- national Development Association's was also lower at S284m. (12 credits) compared with S309m. But commitments by the Inter- national Finance Corporation, the \"private enterprise\" wing of the bank. established a new record for the ten-year-old organisation at $36m. (21 projects). Meanwhile, at the end of its 20th year, the Bank had lent a total of S9.583.6m. Cheap Loans By the end of June, the IDA, the cheap loan branch of the bank, had only S322m. of uncommitted funds. The report reveals that at the close of the fiscal year the Board approved the transfer of S75m. from the bank's net income to the association which \"would enable the IDA to increase its rate of commitments.\" The net income of the World Bank itself in 1965-66 was S143.7m., while the special reserve increased to $289.7m. and the supplemental reserve, against losses and loans, was S663.8m. Generally, the bank's reports says in a special section on the world economy: \"Conditions were not favourable for satisfactory growth of developing countries.\" Specifi- cally, the report mentions in this connection the difficulties arising from the \"disequilibria\" in the balance of payments of major industrial countries. Also, it says that the Indo-Pakistan war \" led to an increased resistance in the donor countries to augmenting external financial resources for develop- ment.\" The report for the World Bank and the IDA (published under one cover) points out that, though new commit- ments were somewhat lower than in 196445. total disbursements rose from S$27.9m. to a record S935.3m. Transport Credits Of the 49 bank loans and IDA credits during the year. transportation projects accounted for about one- third, electric power and industry for about one-fifth each. followed closely by agriculture. The greater part of lending continued to be for infra- structure projects-particularly energy generation and transportation-but the report notes that \"a trend to- wards greater support of human resource development was clearly discernible,\" particularly towards agriculture. In the past, most direct assistance from the bank to agriculture has been through irrigation works and multi- purpose projects that have included power, irrigation and flood control. \"The emphasis has broadened, how, ever, and the bank has become in- creasingly and more concerned with the farmer himself, his land and its productivity.\" In 1965.66 about a third of all bank and IDA financing for apricul- ture was to supply funds for invest- ment on the farm through a variety of credit institutions in Colombia. Mexico. Morocco. Paraguay, the Philippines and Tanzania. The report acknowledges the difficulties of administering many small loans and ensuring their productive use. \" The bank.\" it says, \" has attempted to tailor its approach to the country's stage of development and the moat urgent requirements of its farmers.\" More than half of the bank's industrial financing (amounting to S233m.) went to selected companIes in India and Pakistan to enable them to finance imports of equipment. The rest consisted of loans to 10 develop. ment finance companies. The IFC contiued to make technical and financial appraisal of projects. The report stresse the need to strengthen and expand the machinery for development assistance co-ordina. tion which. the bank believes, would lead to a bettereconomic performance by developing countries and. ulti. mately. to a greater flow of resources, By June, 1966. eight consultative groups and consortia had been organ. ised under the bank's chairmanship, and 19 capital-exporting countries were members of one or more of them. In its survey on the world economy the report calculates that the flow of financial assistance was about the same in 1965 as in each of the pre. vious four years but, as a proportion of the industrial countries combined national income, official aid fell from about 0.8 per cent. in 1961 to 0.6 per cent. in 1965. Interest rates tended to become less concessionary. Private Capital Although the flow of private capital increased in 1965, the report says that \" the main beneficiaries of these flows, especially of direct investments, have been a small number of countries. chiefly petroleum exporters.\" Meanwhile, income payments on private. Investment continued to in- crease and may have exceeded the total inflow of private capital. But the rate of accumulation of public debt slowed down to 10 per cent., compared with a compound rate of 15 per cent. from 1955 to 1963. I",

   "text_content" : "that the deficit for this year and next will be no smaller than the S1,300m. of last year. According to. one eminent and highly influential American economist, who agrees with these estimates, no more than 25 per cent. of this deficit is likely to be financed henceforward by increased dollar holdings abroad. Assuming that both premises are correct, the gold drain from the U.S. is likely to be nearly Sl,000m. next year. This kind of prediction is bound to evoke expressions of gloomy dis- approval during the next few days from the Continentals (and especi- ally, of course, from the French) over the moral derelictions of deficit countries. Whether this atmosphere will actually endanger the negotiations themselves remains to be seen. As at the conference of Com- monwealth Finance Ministers in Montreal last week a good deal of attention and complaint is likely to be centred on interest rates and the indebtedness problem of the less developed countries which now threatens to eat up a quite unacceptable proportion of new development financing. The official British line appear. to be that world interest rates are unlikely to rise much higher and may indeed start to drop a trifle now that the U.S. is taking steps to deal with its own problem in this field. However, this view is disputed by many authorities and certainly World Bank officials feel that it is inevitable that their own lending rates will have to be raised once more in the near future from the present 6 per cent. Chancellor's Post Mr. Callaghan, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was elected chairman ol the Group of Ten Ministers this evening. This will mean that he pre sides at the few Ministerial meeting for the next six months. The Swedish Finance Minister was next in line, coming alphabetically after the Netherlands, but did noi choose to take up the opportunity, Of more importance than this largely honorofic position will be the chairmanship of the Group of Teo deputies which Mr, Otto Emminger, he present chairman, wishas to give up.

Disbursements at $21.9m. were also at an unprece- dented level. In a section reviewing the IFC's 10-year history, the report estimates that 5400m. borrowing facilities with the World Bank (agreed last year) will enable it to undertake individual loan and equity commitments of up to Sl5m.-20m. Previously the largest possible has been S6m. The new re- sources would widen the corpora- tion's ability to assist capital inten- sive industries like fertilisers, petro- chemicals and iron and steel. IFC's net income from operations during 1965-66 was over S4.4m. against S3m in the previous year. Funds available to the corporation were re- plenished from several sources, and the total rose $18.9m. to S192.9m, The growth in commitments caused a fall in uncommitted funds from $482m. to $31.7m. over the year. New commitments were made to 21 enterprises in 16 countries, includ. in for the first time Ecuador and Liberia. There was an increase in underwriting activities and, while equity financing was again a feature of IFC operatins, the corporation also made two. straight loans. Nearly one-third of the corporation's com- mitments were made in partnership with development finance companies in which the corporation is a share- holder. Editorial comment Page 6",

The trading profit for the year was Â£835.021 (1964-5 Â£769 9R)1, pretax profit Â£647.147 (1964.- Â£567.763) and the net profit Â£365.437 (1464-5 Â£224.763) after all deductions, I regard the trading results as highly satisfactory especiallv as costs of manufacture have risen progressively during the course of the year owing to Increnses In the copt of labour, materlsls and services. Rvery effort hna been made to Increase productivity In order to avoid the need to raite selling prices unduy;v Indeed. In many export markets it simplv would not have been possible to raise prices because of the Intense cnmnetiltion from foreign mnci. fncturers, Our success In thil direction is reflected in the trading results. The Finance Act of 1965 changed the basis of taxing compaonies by the introduction of Corporatio!i Tax in lieu of Income Tax and Profits Tax and by making comr panies accountable for the tax deducted from dividends paid to stockholders. In general the effect of these changes is to increase the cost of paving dividends. In view of the fact that the alteration in the basis of company taxation did not have full effect on the com- pany's results for 1965/6 and that a second interim dividend of 120/n was paid on 31st March, 1966. thereby enabling your company to take advantage of transitional reliefs, a non-recurring benefit has accrued to the company. Notwithstanding the adverse effect of the taxation revisions. Your directors consider that the profits earned would justify an Increase in the dividend distribu- tion hut In view of the request hu the Government to exercise divi. dend and wage restraint, your directors have decided to recom- mend the payment of a final divi- dend of 4% on the Ordinary Stock, making a total, with the Interim dividends already paid. of 25% for the vear, The general reserve is maintained at Â£600.000 and the balance of profits carried forward amounts to Â£411.506. It is appropriate at this functure to express the appreciation of the conmpany to its employees for their unstlnied efforts during the past vear. Without their loyal supaort the splendid results on which i have reported would not have bern possible. I am pleased to advise you that Mr H Marsden, the Manuging Director of The Chilling- ton ToVo Company Limited, was appointed SpecllDireor oafr ev industries Imited with et from the Ist August, 1966.

   "text_content" : "WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. Mr. Callaghan, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Fowler. U.S. Treasury Secretary, both sharply criticised to-day the often- expressed French idea of reverting completely to sold. The Chancellor said the idea was one of \" primitive barbarity.\" He was speaking during a joint tele- vision interview with Mr. Fowler. The Ministers agreed the aim \" should be to provide for deliberate creation of more reserves when they were needed-a subject ex- pected to dominate the IMP meetin. Mr. allaghan told Americans that Britain wanted to step up production and start paying its way again. The Chancellor rejected any idea that the U.K. would move into another economic crisis next year. Mr. Callaghan, who is here for the World Bank and IMF meeting, said: \" If we can get the level of pro. ductivity going that you have had here in the last few years, when you have had remarkable success I have no doubt that we can solve the prob- lem. Our whole underlying approach is to try to get an increase In our i productivity.\" They had to set their priorities. continued the Chancellor. and the first was \"to pay our way at the moment. That transcends all the others. When we are paying our way. then we can start doing some of the other things.\" Britain had a modified programme for its commitments in Asia and Europe. but it was not going to walk out on its peace-keeping commit- ments. U.S. Tax Increase? Mr. Fowler expressed full U.S. sup. port for the wage and price measures undertaken by Britain. As far as the U.S was concerned, be said the U.S. Administration was determined to pay expenses out of current revenues. Told this sounded like a tax increase in the offing, he replied: \" It is cer- tainly within the realm of prob- ability.\"-Reuter.",

It will be on -a 60-acre site at Tanfleld Lea, near Stanley, Co. Durham, and will include manu- facturing units, administration block, canteen and ancillary build- ings. When the first phase is com- pleted in 1967 the factory will employ about 250 and when the whole scheme is completed about 1,500. Mowlem has also just obtained a Â£75,000 factory extension con- tract from Clares (Holdings) of Wells, Somerset. The building will be of steel frame construction with brick cladding and will be used for light engineering work. A start on the job will be made on October 1 and will take seven months to complete.

In one project, to cost Â£451,000, the County Council is to build a new road at Eston. The second involves improvements to the Whitby-Guisborough road at Girrick Bank costing Â£92,000. Space heaters for building sites SPACE HEATERS are being in- creasingly used on building sites to speed operations and keep the workers warm. One of the latest to come on the market is the oil- fired Audaheat AS200V which costs Â£175 and under 2s 6d an hour to run. Producing 200,000 BTUs per hour, the heater, which is mounted on four wheels and powered by a % h.p. electric motor, can be used for drying concrete and plaster as well as for general space-heating purposes in large buildings. It is being marketed by Audax of Cen- tral Avenue, West Molesey, Surrey. Another heater is the improved Jan-Aire distributed by Vales Plant Register, Tolpits Lane, Wat- ford, Herts. This is stated to have an exclusive air balance control which allows precise adjustment of air-oilmist mixture to compensate for varying conditions of altitude, air mosture-content and calorific content of fuel. Mounted on two wheels these heaters can be supplied to produce 175,000 or 120,000 BTUs per hour. Houses and shops REDEVELOPMENT of the centre of Winlaton, Durham, is proposed by Blaydon-on-Tyne Urban District Council. No contracts have been let.

Tracked digger and loader A NEW CRAWLER digger and loader for civil engineering work has been introduced by Inter- national Harvester Company of Great Britain. Known as the International 125, it has a 60 h.p. 4-cylinder, indirect injection diesel engine. Drive is taken from the engine through a 13-inch single plate clutch to a sliding gear type transmission which gives four forward and two reverse speeds. The loader is supplied with a 1% cubic yard capacity bucket which has a width of 77 inches and weighs 1,485 lbs. A lighter general pur- pose bucket of the same capacity is also available as well as a 5-tine scarifier for ripping before loading. Â£500,000 Greaves' contracts THE GREAVES Organisation has been awarded three contracts together worth Â£500,000. All are for work in the Birming- ham area and the largest, at Â£300,000, is for a new comprehen- sive school at Perry Barr. In addition to classrooms, there will be a swimming pool, laboratory, library, gymnasium and assembly hall.

   "text_content" : "It can hardly be claimed that he Labour Government's first two ears in office has been in the lature of a success story. Indeed, imagine that those people who nake a virtue out of never mincing vords would maintain that it has nade a proper mess of the job. Yet it has to be admitted that here is one aspect of the British way of governmental life that it las handled with consummate skill. [n case you haven't guessed Llready, I am referring to the time- sonoured practice of ensuring that he blame for the Government's 'ailures is, as far as is humanly sossible, well and truly off-loaded into other shoulders. In the first 18 months of its eign, the scapegoat was, of course, he previous administration. The Conservatives, it was said time and ime again, had left the country's .conomy in such a deplorable ;tate that even a competent, enter- wrising and progressive Labour ad- ninistration could not hope to get things ship-shape for some little while -try as it might. The *ountry would, therefore, have to how a little patience while the tew Wilsonian broom swept away he cobwebs and created a sound )asis for the big leap forward that was certain to come later. It was over-played This excuse was heavily over- ,layed even at the start: The new 3overnment had inherited a size- ible external payments deficit, it s true, along with some domestic .conomic frictions, generated by he previous administration's be- ated efforts to get the badly seeded growth programme under way. But there were no problems hat a really competent enterprising mnd progressive team could not iave reduced to manageable pro- ,ortions in less than a year- %specially if it had taken the rouble to take note of the lessons aught by attempts to resolve sarlier crises. Yet the Wilson team nanaged to get away with the 'legacy\" story right up to the on- met of the \"crisis-within-a-crisis\" .hree months ago. Since it is, as President Lincoln ,ointed out in one of his more in- ;pired moments, impossible to fool ill the people all the time, it could tot be used to exonerate the 3overnment from blame for this atest affair and was consequently liscarded. But no time was lost n getting to work on the prepara- tion of something to take its place. 4nd what seems to have been decided is that the blame should iow be distributed more or less squally between the machinations )f an anti-British Fate and the waywardness of the British people. The \" Fate theme\" figured prom- inently, it may be recalled in the Prime Minister's exposition of the i background to the new super 1 special measures programme un- I veiled in July. Just when every- 4 thing appeared to be going like clockwork, he solemnly informed I the country, the Government had ] been blown off course by the 1 nauseating behaviour of world- i interest rates, with a little help from the seamen's strike. Your own fault The \"it's all your own fault\" refrain has cropped up in a num- ber of public addresses given by Ministers during the past month or two. But it found its most striking manifestation yet in the vicious attack on the morals of the people that Mr. Gunter, the Minister of Labour, featured in a speech he delivered at Doncaster last week. Britain, the Minister declared, had shown itself \"dishonest and thriftless.\" Between April 1965, and April 1966, it had paid itself in additional incomes nearly four times more than it had earned in increased productivity. Conse- quently, the confidence of our creditors and allies abroad had almost gone i.i July of this year and they had been more than justi- fied in demanding that Britain should give some proof of her willingness to come to terms with her problems. This is the Government's story and it obviously intends to see that it is rammed down our throats from now on just as remorselessly as the \" legacy\" theory was earlier on. But what possible justification has it got for this bald-faced attempt to portray itself as without guilt for the latest disastrous turn in Britain's economic affairs? The \" blown- off course\" part of the tale can hardly be regarded as capable of holding any water to speak of. The Labour Party's own insistence on using outmoded monetary policy weapons for meeting the threat to the Pound is itself to a significant extent responsible for the world in- terest rates war that is now proving so inconvenient. And, in any case, the challenge from this direction could have been effectively con- tained had the problem been given adequate attention at the start. Moreover, that other much exaggerated piece of so-called ill- luck-the seamen's strike-was nothing more than the culmination of a long series of income policy blunders that succeeded, among other things, in creating the im- pression that there was one incomes policy for the favoured profes- sional classes, and another for the rest. Turning to the \" people's guilt\" part of the official alibi, it is perti- nent to. point out that in no section of the community did the increase in incomes proceed faster in rela- tion to the growth of productivity in the period ringed round by Mr. Gunter than in that occupied by the Government team. Thanks to the massive increases in ministerial pay the Government sanctioned a few weeks after coming into office to take effect six months later-the delay was to give time for the crisis then raging to recedel- Ministerial salaries rose by any- thing from 50 to 100 per cent in the 12 months to April last. The proof of the pudding being in the eating, it clearly wouldn't be grossly unfair to describe the change in Governmental producti- vity during this phase as having been a minus quantity, in the light of what has happened in the past few months. However, though the Gunter- type charge that the blame for the present mess lies with the people would be less objectionable if the Government had made an attempt to practice what it was preaching, this is not the main reason tor taking vigorous exception to it. That lies in the cool assumption underlying it that it is quite appro- priate to make the people's alleged dishonesty and thriftlessness the scapegoat for the fact that British incomes have been rising so much faster than output. Two Theories There are two somewhat con- flicting theories about the nature of the mandate a British Govern- ment is given. One is that the Government has been appointed to rule the country in accordance with the expressed wishes of the people. The other-usually dragged out when Whitehall is manifestly acting in conflict with popular opinion-is that it has been sent to Westminster to \" lead.\" One thing that does seem to be univer- sally accepted is that its duty is to do one thing or the other. If then it pursues an economic policy that permits an acute disharmony to develop between the behaviour of incomes and the behaviour of pro- duction, it must itself accept full responsibility for the consequences. For it has obviously failed to carry out its assignment to rule and/or lead. And, when all is said and done, was it not the Govern- ment's grossly incompetent handling of the incomes policy issue that made it possible for the people to indulge their natural desire to get much bigger money incomes in the year to April last? And was it not the Government's insistence on keeping the brakes firmly pressed down on economic activity that prevented proddction recording more than a trifling in- crease? For it is quite certain that no community can possibly pro- duce more than official economic policy will allow it to.",

   "text_content" : "IN THE TWENTY years of its life, the World Bank and its chief affiliate have provided loans and credits of just on $11,000m. Production and income in the developing coun- tries have doubled during this period, and \"a few traditionally poor countries are nearing the goal of self-sustaining economic growth.\" Yet the old problems remain. Efforts to increase earnings of foreign exchange can still be frustrated by lower prices for primary produce; the value of an increased inflow of aid can be offset by the rising cost of servicing past debt; improvements in agriculture can be outpaced by the growth of population. What is more, the developed countries have recently become less rather than more ready to help solve these problems. In its latest year, the World Bank's report states flatly, \"world conditions were not favourable for satisfactory growth of the developing coun- tries.\" Down to 0.6% There were several reasons for this. Their exports grew, but less rapidly than world trade and less rapidly than in the previous year because of the relatively sluggish demand for commodities. The war between India and Pakistan not only diverted resources from development but made some richer countries think twice about providing more assistance. An increase in the outflow of private capital was concentrated on a few small petroleum- exporting countries and was probably more than offset by higher dividends and interest payments. Balance of payments difficulties forced one group of countries to trim their aid pro. grammes, budgetary difficulties prevented another from stepping up their programmes to fill the gap. Despite the rapid growth of trade and wealth, in fact, the flow of assistance from the haves to the have-nots has not changed much over the past five years. Official assistance has fallen as a proportion of national income from 0.8 to 0.6 per cent. and its terms-propor. tion in the form of grants, pro- portion tied, average life and interest rate of loans - have become markedly stiffer. For one reason or another, the gap between what governments preach and what they practice is becoming steadily wider. The outlook, as the World Bank is careful to stress, is not altogether bleak. Many develop- ing countries have become more skilled in the business of channel- ling both their own resources and their receipts of external capital in directions where they are most likely to help develop- ment. More of them see the need for urgent measures to in- crease domestic food production and control the growth of popu- lation, which entailed another fall during 1965 in their output of food per head. They are more prepared to accept outside advice and the co-ordination of development assistance from different donors. For the im- mediate future, moreover, the outlook for world trade and for their export earnings looks reasonably good. I.DA. finances Yet they will not be able to finance the volume of imports needed to sustain their economic growth unless more aid is pro- vided on terms that they can afford to meet. And the Inter- national Development Associa- tion, the affiliate of the World Bank that specialises in making soft loans for approved projects, has only $322m. left uncom- mitted: unless its resources are replenished quickly the rate at which it enters into new commit- ments will have to be cut sharply. The President has already pro- posed an increase to members of the Association, and he is known to believe that new resources should be provided for the period 1967-70 on a scale several times that of the recent past. The Commonwealth Finance Ministers were quick to welcome this initiative. Some way must be found round the balance of payments and budgetary obstacles which prevent rich countries from doing as much as they claim they would like to do to help the poor."

   "text_content" : "The annual conference of the I International Monetary Fund, I opening in Washington to-day, will once again discuss world liquidity problems. But progress is likely to be slow. Short-term strains as they arise are now * more and more often dealt with by \" swap facilities.\" This article describes how this system devised by the Central Bankers works In practice. T HE WORDS \"swap facili- ties \" have turned up several times in official announcements of international first aid operations involving sterling, with which we have been graced with increasing frequency since 1961. These have given rise to a certain amount of doubt about what exactly a swap facility is. and how it operates. The first point to clarify is that a swap facility is simply one of several methods of ex- tending short-term credit to a country suffering a drain on its reserves. As Mr. Charles Coombs remarked in March 1963, \"No Central Bank or Treasury official concerned with these defensive arrangements has any illusions that such devices provide any substitute for policy action to correct basic ir'balances in the payments accounts of the countries in- volved.\" His argument was simply that they could buy time during which more far-reaching policies could be developed. The detailed mechanics vary from case to case. \"recise infor- mation is confined to those in- volving the U.S. Federal Reserve System. Operations between the Bank of England and Conti- nental Central Banks are shrouded by a traditional veil of old-world secrecy. Basically. however, a \" swap facility \" is a standby agreement between two countries to provide each other with credit up to a maximum amount on a reciprocal basis, through a temporary exchange of currencies. Such credits are provided for a short period, usually three or six months. This can be illustrated by assuming such a facility exists for $50m. between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The swap can be activated by either side. If the Bank of England wishes to use the swap it would notify the Federal Reserve, which would sell to the Bank of England $50m. in exchange for Â£18m. of sterling. The rate of interest the two parties would pay each other on their deposits has not been disclosed, but is probably below the market level. Using Dollars In practice, if sterling were under pressur'e, the dollars drawn by the Bank would not be likely to remain on deposit for long, but would be used in the foreign exchange market to protect the sterling rate. The two Central Banks would consult each other before the. currency acquired as BRITAIN'S SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES Swap Facilities with the U.S. Federal Reserve. Begun in 1962 and gradually increased. Raised in September, 1966 from S750m. to S1.350m. SEPTEMBER, 1965. Additional arrangements with U.S. and other countries. Arrangements with U.S. still continue. No details announced. JUNE, 1966. Arrangements of previous September, for most Central Banks other than U.S., replaced by new Basie swap agreement in which credits are strictly tied to movements in overseas sterling balances. There is also believed to be an undisclosed longer term component to protect U.K. from running down of balances by sterling holders. SEPTEMBER, 1966. Further swaps announced. No details except increase in Federal Reserve Swap. a result of the swap was drawn upon' in this way. This exchange of credit bal- ances would have a counterpart forward transaction. The Bank of England would undertake to repurchase its sterling (with dollars) in, say, three months' time. Or-to look at the same transaction from the other end- the Federal Reserve would enter into a forward contract to buy dollars from the Bank of Eng- land. The forward contract would ensure that the Bank of England repaid S50m. whatever had happened to the rate of ex- change meanwhile. Thus both countries. are protected against devaluation of either's currency. In practice the process may sometimes be simpler than this description would suggest. If there is an outflow of funds from London, the Federal Reserve is quite likely to have purchased considerable quantities of pounds as part of its effort to support sterling. The swap operation then simply becomes a forward purchase by the Bank of Eng- land of pounds from the Federal Reserve-thus providing the latter with an exchange protec- tion which will enable it to hold sterling in excess of normal requirements. In all probability the U.S. has a very large share in the net- work of swap arrangements i a 3 a 1Â· a f c c s r r t rr I I r J c I I I involving sterling, and other countries' contributions are modest by comparison. The result is that when there is strong selling pressure on the pound from continental centres Britain has to draw heavily on the U.S. swap, and some of the dollars obtained thereby end up in Continental countries. The Americans have then to use their own swap facilities with Continental centres to prevent these dollar balances from being presented in Washington for conversion into gold at the expense of the U.S. reserves. Italy's Surplus This happened during the recent sterling crisis when U.S. drawings under swap arrange- ments with the Continent rose to $470m. The largest of these was a S225m. drawing from Italy, which is now enjoying a heavy balance of payments sur- plus. In late August the Americans made a drawing from the IMF. most of which they used to pay off short-term indebtedness to Continental Central Banks under the swap arrangements. Standing back from the tech. nical complexities it is not too : difficult to see the point of this operation. Britain borrows from the Americans, who are them- selves in deficit, and the Ameri- cans borrow from the IMF. > This enables Britain-whose own borrowing arrangements i with the IMF are nearly used up , -to enjoy the benefit of the U.S.involv drawing rights as well. The limi to this conat little arrange ment will arrive as the Amer cans begin to use up more and more of their own draw in rights and reach the stage at which nasty questions begin to be asked by the Fund. Central Bankers have beto use prepared to help each other out by holding each other's cur rencies, or ganting each othei short-term credits in other ways for many decades. A large paerves. of Montagu Norman's time in the inter-war period was con cerned with arranging transao tions of this kind. The first big publicised post-war Central Banking operation was the \"mentBas with agreement\" of March, 19to61 to offset the large specula- tive movements which broke out after the German Mark revalua- tion. Several Forms The largest amounst of credit outstanding in Britain's favour, under these arrangements, before the Selwyn Lloyd measures brought the run on sterling to an end, was approxi. mately Â£325m, This took several forms: part was in swap arrangem ments under which other Central Banks hold sterling, and part in straight loans of form then cur. rency to the Bank of Enwgland These Basle arrangements con- tinued in force in great secrecy, and were usIMF are nearlyto cushion sterling after the breakdown of the Brussels Common Markel negotiations early in 1963. But it was the Americans who But it was the Americans whc began in March, 1962, to build up the present much more for. malised network of swaps, largely to protect the dollar against short-term movements. These operations are conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which acts as agent for the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System and works in close conjunction with the U.S. Treasury. Opera- tions are conducted by Mr. Charles Coombs, who carries the title of \"Special Manager of the System Open Market ' Account.\" By the end of 1962 Mr. Coombs had negotiated swap facilities amounting to Sl,050m. This has been climbing ever since and reached $2,800m. this year, before the renegotiation announced on September 13 which raised the total to S4,500m. Credits under these ' swap arrangements can be drawn automatically for three or six months. The arrangements are renewable with the consent of both parties. But it is under- stood that in most cases they will be available for a year at a time before serious renegotiations begin. Short-term Facilities ' The value of the whole system is extremely controversial. Even the sceptics would agree that it is undesirable that countries should be blown off course by temporary fluctuations in their foreign exchange positions which may later be reversed. On the other hand, there are those who feel that an inter- national financial structure must be pretty rickety i' it has to be propped up by ever increasing short-term credit facilities, an- nounced at ever more frequent intervals. It is quite true that if countries begar to include their swap facilities in the computation of their official reserves, this could form a basis of a make-shift solution to the international liquidity problem. Because one country's domestic currency be- comes foreign exchange when owned by.another, there seems no limit to the potential creation of new reserves by mutual swaps. But \"' would require a revolution for -ountries to look upon their swap facilities in this way. At the moment they look upon them as potential sources of credit which have to be repaid quite quickly, and are therefore ineligible for inclusion in their official reserve total. Looking at it from a more parochial point of view, it is certainly arguable that the existence of these generous credit facilities has actually been a destabilising influence in the U.K. For they have enabled Governments to postpone tack- ling payments deficits until a large amount of indebtedness has been built up: and the result- Ing lurch to deflation has been more violent and worse timed in relation to the trade cycle than if these facilities had not been available and governments had been forced to take action earlier.",

The court held thai a \" contract of service \" existed ank ordered him to observe the recog nised terms and conditions for thi trade. The case was brought b5 the Amalgamated Slaters. Tiler and Roofing Operatives. However, the former Ministry of Pensions and National Insur- ance refused last year to grant any benefit to an ASTRO member in- lured at work. The man had been employed\" on a contract basis. In this case the Ministry accepted that he could be legitimately re- garded. as self-employed. Mr. Ray Gunter, the Minister of Labour, added to the confusion last autumn. when he stated that employers would not be able to evade their responsibilities under the Redundancy Payments Act by dismissing workers and then re- hiring them on a \" self-employed\" basis. Now the ASTRO has asked the Royal Commission on Trades . Unions and Employers' Associa- tions to recommend outlawing the use of contract labour. Included in its evidence there is also a request that \"labour-only sub- contractors\" be banned. These are agencies which undertake to obtain \" self-employed \" labour for companies which require it.",

Mr. Leslie Cannon, general secretary of the ETU. said in Glas- gow yesterday, after a meeting of Clyde shop stewards, that agree- ment had been reached a year ago permitting partly-skilled men to do work on ships being fitted out, because of the shortage of elec- tricians. Part of the agreement laid down that work study should be instituted as a means of in- creasing electricians' pay. Nothing, however, had been done about this. Mr. Cannon is to seek a meet- ing with the Clyde Shipbuilders' Association and, failing satisfac- tion from this, the union would withdraw from the agreement and semi-skilled men would.have to be replaced by electricians which could lead to delays in ship con- struction. he pointed out. The ETU wanted to see work study teams in the yard before making peace with the owners, he said. What they were seeking was not a pay rise but an increase in wages for higher productivity. There was no other way increased wages could be won. Mr. Cannon claimed that top class electricians on the Clyde received only 8s 6%d an hour, while the semi-skilled earned 6s 8d. At Vickers-Armstrongs' Barrow-in. Furness yard fully skilled electri- cians earned from 10s to lls an hour, he stated. A spokesman of the Clyde Ship- builders' Association said later that when the agreement was introduced the electricians were given an extra 9d an hour, chd since then 3d an hour had been added. He antici- pated that the union would recog- nise the established negotiating machinery if they had any new claim to make.

   "text_content" : "WASHINGTON, Sept 25. Dr. Ludwig Erbard will begin two days of crucial talks with President Johnson here to-morrow. The German Chancellor remarked on arriving last night that the talks \" would not be easy.\" This seems likely to be one of the larger understatements of the year. 7- The difficulties wil probably be minimised in public. The Admini- stration is well aware that Dr. Erhard's political health is pre- carious and that he cannot afford a diplomatic rebuff in Washington. Mr. Johnson may therefore be prepared to allow decisions to be shelved until the year-end, and he will certainly try to produce some \"sweetener \"-probably an agree- ment in co-operation in space research for Dr. Erhard to take home. Main Issues Nevertheless, on the main issues the U.S. Government is prepared for some very straight talking. The most immediate question is the offset costs of the American forces in Germany. The Bonn Government is far behind with its military purchases from the U.S. under the present two-year offset agreement and, to fulfil its part, must place orders for about SI,000m. worth of American equipment before end- December. The agreement runs out next summer and the question is already arising of how and to what extent it is to be renewed. Mr. McNamara, Secretary of Defence, has taken an extremely tough line both on the current and future agreements, and, in spite of misgivings at the State Department, the President seems likely to do the same. Congressional pressure to withdraw troops from Europe is mounting, the balance of pay- ments problem persists, and the demands of the Vietnam war con- tinue to increase. The West Germans appear to be adamant about wishing to reduce their share of the support costs burden-at any rate after the pre- sent agreement runs out-and are believed by most officials here to be resigned to some American troop reductions. These will there. fore almost certainly take place. The question is when and bow many. Tripartite Talks The President can be expected to put much pressure on Dr. Erhard to agree finally to partici- pate in the tripartite talks on offset costs with Britain and the U.S.. proposed by Mr. Johnson last month. This the Chancellor will be reluctant to do since he fears he will be the victim of an Anglo- American pincer movement. Dr. Erhard is likely to be told privately by the: Presidnt that the multilateral nuclear force, the Atlantic nuclear force and similar ideas are in practice dead so far as the U.S. is concerned. He will also be told that the probable withdrawal of American non-combatant troops some time next year will not .be made part of a deal with the Russians.",

   "text_content" : "IT IS A PERENNIAL pastime of lawyers every 'autumn to speculate on the development of the law in the coming year. The annual break from court work for two months-a practice that is being hotly challenged-pro- vides for stocktaking that is both refreshing and instructive. Laymen are excluded from this tightly-knit circle of lawyers practising the apotheosis of restrictive professionalism. They, after all, are only the custo- mers. Barristers often say, with only superficial jocularity, that they could do their cases so much better without the clients-which only goes to demonstrate how insulated lawyers are from the practical daily effect of the law in society. First report Now, thanks to the establish- ment of the Law Commission, the law's customers can take a peek at how the law is likely to develop by way of Parlia- mentary reform, if not through judicial legislating. This summer the Law Commission produced its first annual report, which seems to have aroused little public attention. Perhaps the contents of the report were not sufficiently enthralling to thaw out the wage freeze. But there is much in the report that deserves study and excites the businessman who justifiably wilts at the fustian language of lawyers. There are proposals for change on the law. written in a direct and comprehensive style. Codification has long been the bMre noire of English lawyers. To reduce a branch of law to one comprehensible statute covering all the rules and wiping away all the judicial rulings and interpretations is a Continental practice abhorred by th- English common lawyer. For him. what Tennyson called \" that codeless myriad of prec-dent, that wilderness of single instances, through which a few by wit or fortune led may beat a pathway out to wealth and fame.\" is much more delectable to the intel- lectual palate. The Law Comn- mission looks like reversing this process. The law of contract, that basic instrument of all commercial dealings, is to undergo a thorough refurbish- ing, resulting ultimately as part of a Commercial Code or, wider still, Code of Obligations. This work is also not to be just an idle exercise undertaken by lawyers for lawyers. The Commission states categoric- ally: \"We aim to produce, as a first stage in the work, an annotated draft; this will be made widely available for pro- sessional and lay criticism.... Informal consultations with out- side (non-Law Commission) experts have already taken place. As the work proceeds, there will be wider consultations not only to sound legal and other professional opinion, but also to obtain the views bs the public and the world of Com- merce.\" At last the legal horizon is dotted with people other than lawyers! Exemption clauses If the businessman thinks that this exercise in codifying the law of contract is meaningful only for his grandchildren. there will nevertheless be changes enough in the interim. One of the besetting evils of the concept of freedom of con- tract has been the right of a contracting party to contract out, that is make a bargain for the sale of a commodity and then simply in the contract exempt himself from all the liabilities that generally flow from the obligations of sale itself. The most common ex- ample its the selling of faulty goods; exemption clauses fre- quently prevent the buyer from suing his seller for selling him .goods that were not merchant- able. The freedom to contract out in this way is an acceptable feature of commercial agree- ments only if both parties had equal bargaining power in arriv- ing at the terms of the contract which includes exemption of liability. It may be that a buyer obtaining his goods cheaper than he might otherwise do from another seller is prepared to forego his legal rights as a good commercial risk. But so often the terms of a contract are simply foisted on a buyer who has no option but to \" take It or leave it. This is particularly true of those trades which by their trade associations produce standard form contracts. Working party The courts have proved un- successful in combating this commercial evil, and only recently the House of Lords plaintively called for Parlia- mentary action. And so the Law Commission with com- mendable lack of hesitancy has set up a working party of personnel from Government Departments experienced in industry, commerce and con- sumer problems together with a number of English and Scottish lawyers. Their terms of refer- ence are \" to consider what restraints, if any. should be imposed on the freedom to rely upon contractual provisions exempting from or restricting liability . . . that would other- wise be incurred.\" and then there appears the significant phrase. \"having regard to the protection of consumers of goods and users of services.\" Codification will not be con- fined to the field of contract. Anyone who since the war has been involved professionally, if not personally, in the rent restriction legislation will testify to one thing-its vast com- plexity. And this legislation is an engraftment on the law of landlord and tenant, itself not a subject susceptible of easy and ready intelligibility. Here again the Law Commission has established a working party of experts, and by all accounts the proposals will soon be available for public discussion. And so with a new law year in the offing, the eyes and ears of the commercial world will be focused not only on the courts but on the Law Commission whose task is to refashion our legal system to suit the needs of a modern industrialised society.",

   "text_content" : "Another good week for in- terims opens later today with British Theruostat, London and Thames Haven and Commercial Union (the Prudential interim follows up on Thursday). An- nual results from Glenlvet and Glen Grant may nourish the inner man to-morrow, but half- years come back into promi- nence on Wednesday when Uni- ted Biscits, English Sewing Cotton, United Newspaper and Lamson Industries are due. Much the same applies to Thurs- day-Morgan Cracible, Baker Perkins and George Winpey, although the final from Cromp. ton Parkinson is also expected. B. & S. Massey Coming out of 1965-66 with increases of 35 and 39 per cent. in sales and profits respectively, B. and S. Massey has also started 1966-67 in fine style. Overall sales in the first four months are slightly better than the comparable period and all sections are making profits. It is hoped that steel stockholding, fabrication and foundry companies will be able to maintain current sales, although working on short orders at the best of times they can be quickly affected by a downturn. More encouraging is that the machine building activities have enough work in hand to ensure full capacity for the full year. The main problem is to retain an adequate labour force; but given the prevailing redundancies and short-time working in the Mid- lands, there wpuld seem little danger of a repetition of last year's \" stringent\" labour situation. Due to the acquisition of Joshua Bigwood and higher production when the delivery of supplies was a long and uncertain business, year- end stocks were up from Â£1.37m. to Â£2.40m.., while bank borrowings were Â£791,000 higher at Â£1.29m.- an unfavourable position to be in at current interest rates. However, now that supplies have become easier, it is planned to fund part of bank indebtedness at a \"favour- able\" opportunity. The shares yield 8.9 per cent. at 7s. Anglo-Thai The war in Vietnam might be casting a shadow over Thailand's future, but this has not stopped the Anglo-Thai Corporation from mak- ing better profits. Despite a Â£34,000 provision for the rupee devaluation and a tax ratio of 48% per cent., pretax profits are up by 11 per cent. to Â£583,000. This reflects another boom year in Thailand, and better results from Malaysia, India and Canada. Pakistan seems virtually the only unsatisfactory area or operation. The dividend is maintained at 12% per cent. and cover is extremely strong for an overseas tnradin group-so there might have been a case for an increase but for the freeze. But for several reasons this might not have been forth- coming. Firstly, the tax-free holi- day of Thai Motors is over and overseas tax is now likely to be more than SO per cent. Secondly. a new building programme is needed in Thailand and Singapore, which will necessitate \" fairly sub- stantial capital outlays over the next few years.\" Since net liquidity is only Â£242,000, this suggests a need for retentions. But no credit has been taken for overspill and even on a higher tax charge, cover for the gross dividend should still be around twice. This factor and the healthy current trading position supports the share price, but at 8s 3d the yield is only 7.6 per cent. Hall Engineering For the first six months of 1966 Hall Engineering has lifted sales from Â£7.96m. to Â£8.1m., but with the pressure of costs and competi- tion also increasing profits have sone the other way. And allowing for stock value adjustments written into the 1965 figures the fall from Â£527,000 to Â£516,000 pre-tax is probably the best picture. Even so Hall has done reasonably well; the overseas side has come back, and the state of the building indus try at home has certainly not helped a group reputed to be the largest manufacturer and supplier of welded mesh to the construc- tion trade. The engineering interests, how- ever, have almost made up the difference, and prospects despite current conditions are viewed with confidence. It is comforting to know that Hall's motor activities are only a small part of the group, and not likely to be affected materially-unless conditions get a lot worse. It looks therefore as if profits are going to mark time yet again, but at 12s 6d yielding 8.1 per cent. on the forecast of a main- tained 20 per cent. dividend the shares are not expecting much more. Assuming the same profits in the second half, earnings work out at roughly 30 per cent. indicat- ing a P/E ratio of 8.2, which again looks fair.",

   "text_content" : "The Norcros share price-down to 9s 3d yielding 11.1 per cent.- will get no lift from the latest half- time figures. Sales are only frac- tionally higher and the 5 per cent. rise in pre-tax profits to Â£875,000 turns into a slight fall at the net level with tax taking 43% per cent. of the gross. The interim dividend, however, is held at 8Y/ per cent. Because of various adjustments the figures are probably better than they look, but not by much, and again it is really a question of swings and roundabouts; in terms of divisions it is three up and three down. The main improvements come from heavy sngineering-Â£145,000 against Â£83,000-probably reflect- ing the benefit of non-recurring losses with sale of Blythawood Shipbuilding and rationalisation of the Tinsley haulage business-and from manufacturing, Profits hero rose from Â£203,000 to Â£308,000. Hygena, kitchen equipment, could be doing better, while Neil and Spencer and Temperature were ex- pected to contribute more. The weak spot seems to be the transport side. Even allowing for the sale last year of Harold Wood, profits have come back Â£94,000 to Â£110,000, and since Jenson Motors does not appear to be the main offender, this leaves- Bulk Carriers to explain the shortfall. The real point in the interim statement, however, is that the deterioration in the economic situation could \" seri- ously \" affect the remainder of the year. So with cover only 1.1 times on last year's profits the 20 per cent, dividend looks precarious. The only comforting point is that Norcros has the resoarces to buy either profits, or support the un- earned part of the dividend cost if it comes to the worst.",

Current trading is satisfactory, but a warning is given that the recent deflationary economic measures could, during the remaining four months of the financial year, seriously affect subsidiaries- UUIus5i\"uI a. This, the directors say, applie \"particularly and increasingly \" tc the consumer goods companies. The first half pre-tax balance wa. arrived at after providing Â£102,000 against Â£96,000, for loan stock in terest, general charges, etc. After heavier estimated taxation oi Â£381,000 (Â£340,000), the balanac attributable to the group was littl changed at Â£494,000, against Â£496,000 External sales for the period were Â£12,205,000 (Â£12,158,000) and direci exports Â£877,000 (Â£1,175,000). A reduction in agency and distri bution profits reflects the minorit3 interest now owned by Nations Pharmaceutical Union in S. Maw Son and Sons-the benefits of thih association will be \"felt increasingly' in future. Â£50,000 to Terminate Service Contract During the six months a paymeal of Â£50,000. not taken into account ii the.trading figures, was made to Mr Kenneth Rouse, a joint managini director of the subsidiary Autotype to terminate his long-term servic contract, Mr. J. V. Sheffield, Norcro chairman, explained yesterday that thi Autotype acquisition was made at i cheap price because of life servico agreements. In the vehicles and transport divi sion, Jensen Motors recovered fron the adverse effects of the last hall of 1965 and results of the 12 monthI to July 31, are \" almost comparable' with last year. Losses of Ward Brooke and Co. acquired in March, have now beer substantially reduced to the poin where manufacturing division figure; include a loss of Â£2,000 only for thi two months April and May. It i! anticipated that subsidiary will maki Â£50,000 before tax for the eigh -- j , *-# -luuayj aLUswA months to November-this would have been considerably higher but for wild cat strikes and unofficial labour agitation. An unchanged interim of 8) per, cent. was recently declared-the pre- vious year total was 20 per cent. Minority interests have been deducted in showing the results, and where subsidiaries' accounts are for years ending other than November 30, the first six months' results have been utilised. The 1965 half-year figures for the vehicles and transport divi- sion, and the estimated tax charge, have been adjusted for the sale, in the latter half of fast year, of Harold Wnnm ant SnnÂ«",

   "text_content" : "Lower profits for 1966 are indicated by Lovel's Shipping and Transport Group, which is maintaining the interim dividend at 3 per cent. but sounds a warning note as to the year's payment. Estimated group profit for the sii months ended June 30, 1966 was just over Â£5,000 (after depreci- ation of Â£67,000) compared with Â£71,000 (after depreciation of Â£59,000) for the first half of 1965. This result was due to the pro- longed seamen's strike, says the chairman. Mr. G. E. Lovell. Other sections of the business were also affected and the overall cost of the strike to the group was about Â£65,000. But for the impact of the strike, profits for the first half of 1966 would have equalled those for the first half of 1965, and the directors feel this exceptional setback should not be the decisive factor in determining the interim. In the present uncertain economic climate it is impossible to forecast the results for the second half but indications are that the profit will be \"markedly lower than for the cor- responding period in 1965.\" In these circumstances and bearing in mind the loss due to the seamen's strike, the directors emphasise that the unchanged interim does not imply that if any further distribution Is made it will equal the second interim dividend of 6 per cent. paid for 1965. H. S. WHITESIDE A notice has been sent to share. holders of H. S. Whiteside and Co. reconvenin the annual meeting for October 17, The 1964 accounts have been prepared and passed to the audi- tors and will be completed as soon as possible.-it will therefore again be necessary to submit that the meeting be adjourned. As known, the com- pany is In the hands of a receiver and manager. The directors say they are informed that the Camberwell property has been sold for Â£420,000-part of the ore. mises continue to be used as officea on a rental basis, Also, the half In. terests In McCormick (U.K.) and Beatrice Foods (U.K.) have been sold to the American shareholders, while the hamper packing division has been fomed Into a now wholly owned sub. cIdiary called White Rose Pood Packers,. The receiver and manager is con. tinuing group trading activities, The statement on affairs at September 20, 1965 (the date of appointment of the receiver and manager), already circu- lated, showed an estimated deficiency a regards members of Â£2,032,502, subaect to costs of the recelvership and to any surplus or deficlency on trading pending reallsations, THIS WEEK'S CALLS mbe 30-475 per cent, on llmbo anek 7 per cant, Sub.

KIRKSTALL FORGE Owing to the recent deflationary measures Kirkstall Forge Engineering (commercial vehicle axles, drop forgings, etc.) has already suffered reductions in delivery requirements of some customers, reports the chairman, Mr. R. F. Butler. And he has no doubt that, in due course, \" we shall receive notification of reduced demands from other customers who have not yet felt the full effect of the present economic crisis.\" Commitments for capital expendi. ture have been cut from Â£216,000 to Â£76,000 this year, although the chair. man would expect the actual year's expenditure to exceed the provision. In the past the company has spent freely on new plant and machinery, and so in times of uncertain outlook can defer purchases without jeopardising its prospects. Mr. Butler explains. As It Is diffcult at this point to forecast for the current year he hopes in due course to give members Information regarding the first asix months trading and the general outlook. Group profit, before tax for the year ended June 30, 1966, was Â£338,826 (Â£325,338) and the dividend remains at 9 per cent., as reported on September 6. Meeting.

Second half profits are normally higher than in the first half, but in- dustry uncertainty and the effect on demand in the coming months of the \"drastic\" economic measures make it difficult to predict with confidence that this pattern of trading in the group as a whole, will continue, says chairman Sir James Hutchison.

Maney and Sons, is confident that in the longer term the established trend of increasing turnover and profitability will continue. --- Group sales for the first sout months of the current year show a \"slight increase\" over last year, but the chairman stresses that it is not possible to say whether the trend will continue. It would, he says, be \"fool- hardy \" to forecast the final profit in present conditions-but he tells members that all sections are presently trading profitably. Funding Planned Group, overdrafts at March 31, 1966, stood at Â£1,288,829 (Â£497,789) due principally to increases in stocks from Â£1,366,358 to Â£2.404,615. Steps have since been taken to reduce stocks which will relieve the reliance on bank borrowing, part of which will be funded \"at a favourable oppor- tunity.\" Commitments were estimated at Â£184,000 (Â£1114,000). As stated on August 23, pre-tax profit increased from Â£243,411 to Â£338,715 in 1965.66 but \"did not come up to our expectations \"-in the latter part of the year, marine orders for the forge fell away seri- ously and development of an extremely stringent labour situation prevented completion of several large contracts for machines which the directors had anticipated would be delivered before March 31. Group sales increased by 35 per Chairmaa's St cent. and in view of the continued and steep rise in costs \"it is credit- able that group profits also increased by 39 per cent.\" The trading profit - Â£430,395 (Â£283,690)- comprised general engineering, machine building and drop forging Â£249,983 (Â£148.205), steel and plastic fabricating Â£53,414 (Â£24,967) and steel stockholding Â£126,998 (Â£110,518). The company has continued to devote considerable resources and effort to new developments and the bulk of the development expenditure has been charged to the year's account before arriving at the profit. High Export Orders > The intake of orders for export was maintained at the high level of the previous year but home orders received a considerable reverse dur- ing the last quarter due to uncer- tainties which arose in the industrial climate and, to a lesser degree, the lengthening of delivery time after the very substantial build-up of the order book during the early part of 1965. A dividend total of 121 per cent. has been paid on capital increased by a one-for-one rights issue at par and the acquisition issue in respect of Joshua Bigwood (against the equivalent of 151 per cent. on smaller capital).

He stresses, however, that the forecast is subject to there being no major upheaval in the Far East. The tax charge is likely to be \" sub. stantially higher\" because the tax-free holiday enjoyed by Thai Motor In. dustries ended on March 31, 1966. Taxation Rate The overall effective rate of over- seas tax on group profits is, therefore, likely to be in excess of 50 per cent. against the U.K. corporation tax rate of 40 per -cent. Furthermore, as previously indi. cated, even to maintain the same rate of dividend will require an apprecl. ably greater amount of cash in future years owing to the 1965 Finance Act. Relief for tax paid overseas being allowed only against the parent com- pany's liability to corporation tax. As stated on September 17, group pre-tax profit in the year to March 31. 1966. rose from Â£525,100 to Â£583,272, but after a higher tax charge, the not balance was down from Â£296,375 to Â£285,470.

   "text_content" : "GENEVA. Sept. 25. Renewed and poslbly bitter criticism of the present long- term arrangement regulating International cotton textile trade is expected here this week, as the GATT Kennedy Round trade talks turn to this section of their current trade negotiations. The less developed countries, Western delegates anticipate, will renew their long criticism of the present long-term arrangement .when it comes up for annual review here these next days. The five- year agreement will be closely examined by the 29-member Cotton Textiles Cnmmittee of GATT. and conference sources doubt it will escape quite unscathed. The arrangement, negotiated on U.S. initiative, and expiring in September, 1967, is aimed at eas- ing the economic development of the less developed producer countries, while attempting to pre- vent disruptive results in individual import and export markets. For instance, it allows an importing country to take certain restrictive measures when that country be- lieves that cotton textile imports are disrupting its own domestic market. Complaints Many countries have repeatedly complained to GATT that their exports rate of growth have de- clined since the arrangement came into operation. India, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey the United Arab Re- public and several other exporting countries seem those most hard hit. They have claimed also that their interests are being harmed by. im- provements in the cotton textiles industries of developed countries. These lesser developed countries and others have also complained that some industrialised countries make excessive use of restrictive measures so far permitted, and have bitterly criticised the absence of international supervision of the arrangement's restrictive clause. These complaints are sure to be aired again this week. The develop. ing countries will take the oppor- tunity in this week's four-five day private meetings to air their views more than thoroughly, as the whole operation of the long-term arrange- ment is to be reviewed. But their hopes may well be short- lived. since the GATT committee is not expected to decide at this stage whether the arrangement will be modified, renewed, or merely allowed to fade away. London Conference The discussions in Geneva were at the back of the minds of delegates who attended last week's annual con- ference in London of the International Federation of Cotton and Allied Textile Industries. This could be seen in the official statement issued on Saturday at the conclusion of the meetings. Dealing with international trade in textiles, the federation said it was difficult to make specific recom- mendations, because of the controver- sial nature of the subject. Members, however, should keep the proceedings in Geneva under close observation. In view of the growing importance of cotton and allied textiles in foreign trade, and the great sensitivity of textile markets, the federation hoped that due consideration would be given to these products in future international negotiations. The conference was attended by more than 140 delegates from 23 countries, representing over two-thirds of the world's productive capacity of cotton and allied textiles. The Federation congratulated the coun. tries which had set up the newly- formed International Institute for Cotton. and urged other cotton- growing and exporting countries to join the Institute. However, the idea of an inter- national - commodity control agree- ment for cotton was again rejected. The Federation reiterated its view that such an agreement would be economically undesirable, and not technically feasible.",

   "text_content" : "w- w in t arrival of the Austra* lian touring team in early October, rugby players both at national and county level face a very crowded programme, and while they have their own problems of form and fitness an even greater onus than usual falls upon their selecton. Not least does it drop upon M. R. SteeleBodger, the new chairman of the England selectors, who are re- joined this year by D. B. Vaughan and add J. F. Butterfeld to their number. I recently asked Mr. Steele- Bodger his views on England's problems and their possible solu- tions. We agreed that although England had fielded some good last year, the team really daceda a player of extra class or outstanding authority with flair enough to inspire the others; one mused on the difference a Peter Jackson or a Richard Sharp would have made. Secondly, the pack had again been lighter than in the #o0d days of the 'fifties. Finally injuries to key members, particu. larly in Paris, had not only severely hampered the players, but also hindered the development of the team. In this context I asked how he could justify the wholesale drop. ping of four players after the Welsh game last year, and was told that one was forced to pick the team from match to match, and that with certain exceptions a poor game in an international was usually followed by an appreciable lack of form in club rugby. Accepting these points as valid, but hinting that a new spirit was needed, I asked whether we could expect any innovations either selectorially or more especially in the format of the Friday before the international, and it was inter- esting to learn that the chairman, with the help of his colleagues, will closely advise on the wide tactical implications of the game in hand. The players will be told in more specific terms what is expected of them; not that the captain will be deprived of _Â·Â·_Â· flexibility in tactics, for ultimatel) it is he who directs the ame. . Purthermore, greater time will be spent during team practice on a thorough appreciation of the prob- lems to be faced in thatarticuli game, and on careful inculcation ol possible methods of winninga This extra attention at a prolonged prac tice could do much to obviate the disadvantages for a team which draws its members from wide: areas than any other of the Home Countries. Clearly selectors cannot take players completely into their con' fdence on certain points. However, Mr. Steele-Bodger hopes that the communication of ideas and inten tions (without being too rigid) will give the players more confidence in themselves. Where else, I asked would the confidence come from, The new chairman set store on a win in the first game to give them the necessary impetus to show their true worth. This does 'hnot mean that we shall see open rugby for its own sake, but that he hopes the team will be geared primarily to win, and secondly to entertain. This they hope to do by playing to strength or concentrating on opponents' weaknesses. Since this notion of very close communication between selectot and player is something new, I pur- sued the idea of confidence among the players, suggesting that, in addition to the trials, selected players could spend a week-end in team training and playing. This would give the selectors in my view a much more symmetrical view of the individual abilities. While seeing the benefits of this scheme Mr. Steele-Bodger pointed out that it would need the approval of the International Board, and that clubs and counties might be reluctant to release their players further. Certainly such a scheme is impossible this year, he thought, while accepting that it would be an ideal time for a pooling of regional ideas. The first trial is only three weeks hence, but already selectors, guided by their chairman, have carefully evaluated their priorities and, as I see it, Mr. Steele-Bodger faces the alternative of unearthing a couple of class players or providing the established with more authority. Pailing these two courses he must adapt the established players to rather different instructions. Two final points make one feel the England XV will be better this year. Firstly, England have only provided five Lions, and thus the team will not experience the tremendous physical and mental jadedness of having to play for three consecutive seasons. Secondly the Wales match will be the last England game in April. This post- ponement should do much to relieve the tension always associated with this game and, who knows, unless we have freakish weather, we may see a game worthy of the occasion and the players.",

   "text_content" : "FOLLOWING three days of superlative racing at Ascot, and with the first October meeting at Newmarket in the immediate offing, it is not surprising that to-day's fare at Nottingham and Hamilton Park is of a modest order. At Nottingham, F. Armstrong, who is singularly adept at placing successfully the more moderate animals in his large string, saddles Field Mouse for the Watnall Plate (2.0). A filly by Grey Sovereign, she has already won two consecutive races in the Mid- lands without being fully extended, and by all accounts she is expected to complete the hat-trick. However, Field Mouse will have her work cut out to get the better of Salon, a bay filly by Fortino II, owned by the Duke of Norfolk, who was a conyincing winner at Brighton less than a fortnight ago, and who, in her previous race. was runner-up to the youthful Queen Bess at Goodwood. The most valuable race at Not- tingham this afternoon is the Chapel Bar Handicap (3.0) for three-year-olds, run over two miles. And the probable winner here is Major Oak, who scored comfort- ably over 1% miles at the York Ebor meeting, and who, subse- quently, performed well when runner-up to Red Rumour, for the William Butler Trophy at Wolver- hampton on September 10. Ace King is the danger. Possibly the best bet at Notting- ham this afternoon is Cornell in. the Toton Nursery Handicap (3.30). This Milesian filly, owned by Mr. J. U. Baillie, who is one of the luckiest-because he is also one of the most knowledgeable-owners in racing to-day, appears to be reasonably weighted with 8 st 2 lbs bearing in mind that she finished third to Darya and Full Stretch in the Selsey Stakes at Goedwood, in which race she failed to get a clear run. The distance here is likely to suit her. Roaming Star, who must surely qualify as one of the most unlucky horses of the season, ought to win the Trowell Handicap (4.0), but I have a horrid feeling that some animal with no apparent preten- sions of winning will come and beat him, though it Is hard to see where the danger lies. No one in their senses, unless they are familiar with Scottish form, will be inclined to bet heavily on any of the events at Hamilton Park this afternoon. However, it looks as if Goabundle, in spite of a 6 lbs penalty incurred as a result of winning at Ayr 10 days ago, might provide a satisfac- tory solution to the Lord Hamilton of Dalzell Memorial Nursery Handicap (3.30); and The Wiend ought to give backers a good run in the Lanarkshire Handicap (4,0).",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent NEW DELHI, Sept. 25. An overwhelmin majrity of the members of the A*ll-nda Congress Committee-the ruling Party's supreme executive-demanded the immediate nationalisation of banks, general Insurance and key indus- tries before endorsing the draft election manifesto here to-day. The two-day session heard a near unanimous call for \" radical\" poll- cles and programmes. Only one member from Bombay plucked up courage to warn his colleagues of the dangers of extending bureau. cratic control of the economy by pleading for a nationalisation pro. gramme. He urged a revision of the manifesto to reaffirm Congress adherence to the concept of a mixed economy, This lone voice was drowned In fiery socialist logians. On behalf of the high command, Mr. Krishna Menon tried to assuage the feeling of the AICC by sharing their Impatience. He said that overty copid hbe eradica. ted only by eliminating dicrimina' tlon. The manifesto could only live guidelines for the establish. ment of Socialism, \" Let the Gov. ernment be free to decide how and In what manner banks or other things should be nationalised,' be added,",

   "text_content" : "Mr. Jo Grimond wound up bis Party's annual assembly on Saturday with a stanch defence of the militant Young Liberals and the policies they team-rollered through- often agalst the wishes of a bemused executive. But despite Mr. Grimond's accolade, many Adeleates left r --- - - Brighton wondering quite what the Liberals now represented and what effect the new policies would have on the middleclass elements in the nartv. I The flrt conference after a general election could have been a morose affair, but the younger delegates fred it with life by their attempt to find radical. leftist poll- cies which can be polished and developed well before the next election. Their success indicates that the Liberals have ceased to be a centre party, nipped almost into extinc- tion by the power blocs of the Tory and Labour Parties. Instead Liberals. following the Brighton debates, are now well to the left of Labour on most major issues. Attack on Wilson Party propaganda, for instance. will in future be concentrated on attacking both the Labour and Tory Parties for being \"conserva- tive minded *\" and an intensive cam- paign will be mounted for Labour votes. Mr. Grimond concentrated on this theme for much of his speech. which included a biting condemna- tion of Mr. Wilson's period as Prime Minister. \"We have in Downing Street.\" he said. \"a Prime Minister who. far from making it into a power house. has turned it into a conjuror's parlour. With great virtuosity he plays everything off the cuff. and he has the longest cuffs in hitonrv\" It would bccinm -' ,ovious in the mont'- .., iie added. that the present Government did not represent Labour. \" In the House of Commons Mr. Wilson now leads as middle-class a party as I do or Mr. Heath.\" He accused Mr. Wilson of turning an economic problem inherited from the Tories into a disaster in his attempt to provide Government by gimmick. It was unrealistic, he argued, to give the impression that the freeze could be lifted in the first half of next year and that Britain could then return uninhibited to the old world of inflation. Workers' Fear \"Mr. Wilson earnestly assures the unions that it is a question of squeeze or unemployment and then arranges sot both.\" declared Mr. Orimond. \"Let there be no doubt that they are deliberately creating unemploy. ment. they have gravely undermined the confidence of the country. \" They have spread a fear and in- security among weekly wage earners which has not been present since the war. They have revived many of the ghosts of unemployment which have ogged sensible economic policies for so long and which were just begin- ning to be forgotten. This is hardly the atmosphere in which to invoke dynamism and technological change.\" The Liberal leader went on to defend the two most controversial initiatives produced by the \"red rÂ·------ -~ -- Â·- Mr. Jo Grimoad guard\" of Young Liberala-the reference back of the resolution in favour of NATO and the demand for worker control in industry. wa,%WTU rrUw w W &hV The defeat of the NATO motion, he said, was a very sensible recogsni don of the need to re-think NATO's future, and he praised the idea of workers' councils and their right to share in decision making. But although most of the speech was on economic measures. Mr. Grimond avoided any reference to the controversial decision to support the phased devaluation of the pound. He saw Britain's economic situation as \" not desperate\" but as a marginal inability by the nation to pay its way. The most unexpected view Mr. Grimond put forward was on British entry to the Common Market-for years a cornerstone of Liberal policy. \" We maintain our desire and determination to get into it,\" he said ' but much as I would regret. it seems to me possible that we have missed our chance. The time has come when, at the same time as we stiffen our determination to get into the Market, we must begin to look at alternative contingency plans to protect our home market.\" But Mr. Grimond did not define his ideas on this point.",

   "text_content" : "Labour Minister Mr. Ray Gunter's speech last week, accusing the people of being \"dishonest and thriftless,\" was described by Mr. Enoch Powell at the week-end as \" an impudent bid to escape responsibility.\" Mr. Powell, who, is Opposition spokesman on economic affairs. told Yorkshire Young Conserva- tives at Blackpool that the Government's wish to make ordi- nary men and women believe the 1 fault was theirs in.living beyond I their means, working less hard and consuming more than they pro- duced, amounted to \"one of the public relations coups of modern times-for never was there a I fouler libel.\" Â£273m.

I. am afraid, however, it is all too clear that his I we' meant the people at large- i not the Government, but the governed. \" Being so. the 'statement was not only insulting but an impudent bid to escape responsibility, all the more im. pudent for the humbugging tone of morality in which it was couched.\" \"Britain last year earned by the sweat of its brow a surplus of Â£273m. plus massive sums saved and invested abroad.\" he pointed. out. \" But the Government proceeded to spend not only all of that but a further Â£354m. which it obtained by borrowing from other countries, particularly from America. \" It is for the sake of this trans- action, of which the ordinary man and woman, the British worker and British management are wholly guilt- less and almost wholly unaware. that they are abused night and day by Her Majesty's Ministers and held up to the world as feckless and thriftless, unwilling to earn enough to keep themselves.\" Mr. George Brown, Foreign Secretary, said at Derby yesterday that Britain must accept a role of leadership in the world to-day. as people all over the world wanted us to: This entailed economic strength and stability. ' \"Nations new and old are disappointed when we can't or won't exercise the leadership and influence for which they look to us.

   "text_content" : "The Royal College of Organists, just over a century old, is a vigorous body whose liveliness has been fittingly shown by the enterprising restoration of the painted facade of their unusual and graceful Victorian head- quarters which forms such a pleasing feature in the extra- ordinary complex of buildings round the Albert Hall. Vigour. however, does not guarantee wealth and the RCO badly needs money to complete various pro- jects such as the rebuilding of the main organ, the expansion of the library and other services. A minor revolution in taste due partly to the interest in baroque music and the instruments on which it was played has brought the organ back into favour. For a time it seemed that the grandiose 19th century type of instrument and style of playing were in decline. But taste now evolves so quickly that co-existence seems more probable, and indeed will be possible on the new RCO organ. In the programme \"Organ in Sanity and Madness\" put on by the College in the Albert Hall on Saturday night the great monster at the back looked tolerantly on the litter of small organs at its feet. Eminent organists clambered energetically over the platform (like policemen, organists get younger and younger) producing a medley of noises ranging from the shattering roar of Widor's Toccata on the giant instrument to the crystalline whispers of a concerto by Soler played on two chamber organs. Handel. Bach and Samuel Wesley were also represented. There were curiosities (a Storm by the 19th century Belgian, N. J.

   "text_content" : "Inquest; The Warren Commission and The Establishment of Truth, by Edward Jay Epstein; Hutchinson, 30J. President Kennedy was assuassin ated on November 22, 1963. Ten months later the Warren Comr mission published its report, stating its conclusion that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald. Since then there have been numerous attempts to discredit the Commission's work, but this book is by far the most disturbln., It began as a master's thesis In government at Cornell University; Epstein looked at the Warren Commission as a case study in how a anvernment reacts to an extra- ordinary situation in which there ure no rules or precedents to guide it. In pursuing the project Epstein became convinced that, for all its prestige and the resources at its command, the Commission's per' formance was hurried and super' floal, and that Its formal objective, to establish the truth, was fre- quently subordinated to an im* plicit political objective to clear up rumours that were damaging the reputation of the U.S. Part of the trouble was that the Commissioners themselves, and most of the lenior lawyers called n to assist them, were busy men who had to lt the Commissilon's activities Into very crowned sohe dules. The direction of the Investl fation ell almost wholly on the Commission' chief counsel, J Lee Rankin, and much of te eld work was curried out by relatively junior and Inexperienced lawye Moreover, Rankn and hli stasn were not Independent Invet gators, but rather they were working for MV fell ____ _~_ ow the Commission and hence In- clined to present their findings In a way that would be acceptable to the Commissioners. The work took much longer to complete than had been expected, The original dead. line of June 1, 1964 had to be ex. tended, but the Commission was under strong political pressure to publish the report well before the Presidential elections in November, in case It became a campaign issue, Some of the evidence, there. fore, was not thoroughly studied. Unlike other writers on this subject, Epstein makes no attempt to build alternative theories. His aim is to shed lilht on the inner worlking of the Commission and to show how I method of opra tion Interfered with Impartial itudy of the evidence. One of the key ouestlons was whether President Kennedy and Governor Connally (who wa riding In the same car) had been hit by the ame bullet, It was phyically IImpouIble for the aasnaton rifle to have been fired twice during the time period when the two men were first wounded. Either both men were hit by the sime bullet or there were two assassins. ut the medical evi. dence, thouh not conclusive, mIde it Improbable that the same bullet could have pamud throuh PresIdent in- Kennedy's body and wounded the in Governor. After much disagree' to ment the Commissioners put into ok the report the statement that ther wad was \"very persuasive evidnce\" id- that the lame bullet hit both men, ox. but the point was not explored as as full as It should have been. to Epstein argues that a serious :he dlicussion of the two-bullet hypo- or, thesis would have raised the ques- gn tion of a possible second assassin, re- and that this would have under* ed, mined the dominant purpose of the hs Commission which was \" the it sttling of oubts and suspicions.

   "text_content" : "With this Walklire, Decca coam plete the Ring that they began recording eight years ago. Vollendet ist-well, not quite das owige Werk, but then Valhalla did not prove eternal either. The Decca Ring is a magnificent achievement. At least two of its parts, the Rheingold of 1959 and the G5terdilmmerung of 1965, are landmarks in gramophone history. None of it falls below a level of high artistic seriousness and techni- cal mastery, and some of it is in- spired. My praise for this final instalment is not going to be unreserved, but my respect and admiration for John 'Culshaw. director of the enterprise, and the teams under Georg Solti who made the sounds, and under Gordon Parry who captured and presented them to such effect, remain immense. The constant element in this Ring, apart from the Decca team, is the Vienna Philharmonic under Solti. In Das Rheingold Wotan was George London and Fricka was Flagstad; eight years later they are Hotter and Christa Ludwig. It was natural that Die Walkilre should be left till last. In 1958 Decca had already presented Act 3 complete (and the central scene of Act 2) with Flagstad, Svanholm, Edelmann, under Solti; and the fol- lowing year Act I complete, with Flagstad and Svanholm, under Knappertsbusch. These sets too \"made history,\" for Wagner had not been so well recorded before; and they blazed a trail for the complete Ring that was to come. In any case Die Walkilre was already available complete, con- ducted by Furtwangler on an HMV set which has still not been sur- passed (more of it later); and in 1962 ROA had borrowed Nilsson and London for yet anotner cor- 1 plete Walkire. Because Solti is highly esteemed a Wagner conductor, there can be I no harm in putting the case against him as strongly as possible. It is that he seems to find little more in The Ring that the notes on the pages before him. He does not engage singers, players and audi- ence in a mighty myth which seeks 1 to impose artistic order on human ' history and experience, which I probes both the inner springs of I man's individual actions, and the I interaction of man upon man i i the various kinds of society he has evolved. His interpretation of The Ring seems to lack any philosophi- cal basis. In the last resort it is superficial. The listener-of course I am not writing about Mr. Solti personally, only of the character as revealed in his work-may well feel that he lacks the breadth and stature, as thinker and feeler, to do justice to the great work. He diminishes the grandeur of Wagner's conception by being sentimental in the warm, loving passages, and \" vital\" to the point of vulgarity in the energetic ones. Vividly realised detail is not related to a total view of the work and what it means. This is a feel. ing hard to verbalise; but I think anyone who has heard both the Furtwingler and the Solti record- ings of Tristan, and now of Die Walkiire, will understand what I mean. Die Walkilre, by this reasoning, brings out the worst in him, for in Act I the Siegmund-Sieglinde love- music is \"dwelt on\" with sickly sweetness (cello themes, in parti- cular, suggest milk-chocolate gone soft), while the reflective episodes of Act 2, where the musical inci- dent is thinly spread, become very boring. This approach encourages Crespin to sing Sieglinde's \" Im Bach' erbllckt' ich mein eigen RiA \" fnr ovammal in a env mmr. JLL w oDy A INvKCW rFU viI An Elsenstei sketch for his production of 'Die Wallkre' at the Bolboy, 1940 mur, and James King to prolong Siegmund's \"Wilsel Walse! \" like an Italian tenor waiting for the ap- plause; fails to put sinew into a Wotan who each year becomes more effusively romantic; and tempts the Bruinnhilde to an exag- geratedly \"artistic\" gentleness in dolce passages. On the other hand: Solti draws playing of the utmost intensity and radiance from the Vienna Philharmonic. He fires both singers and players with enthusiasm. The sheer energy of his performance is exciting. And more than that: Wagner's genius can on occasion seize him, so that he surrenders to the music instead of dominating and driving it. Then his faults dis- appear. We no longer have that feeling that he is trying to \"prove something.\" This happens in most of Gitterditmmerung, which is a noble and spiritually elevating per- formance. It happens again in the third act of Die Walkuire, which is profoundly moving. Regine Crespin has made two Walkiire recordings in the last year. In the other-due as the first instal- ment of the Deutsche Grammo- phon Ring conducted by Karajan -she is Brlnnhilde. Her Sieg- linde is sensitive, intelligent, and admirably sung until the \"was im Busen ich barg\" sequence shows strain, when we need soaring free- dom. James King is a solid, rather baritonal Heldentenor; \" Winter- sturme\" needs more lyrical sweet- ness than his thick, virile tones can provide, but he is intelligent, and sound, and could hardly be bettered to-day. Hotter is now a soft-grained, very theatrical Wotan. While I appre- ciate the subtlety of his inflexions and the scale of his emotional pro- jection-he certainly has philoso- phic penetration-I find myself again and again hungry for some real, solid notes instead of noble, poetic wooflling (Frantz's firmly sung but more prosaic performance g on the Furtwangler set is the anti- e dote). We can t have everything. - Madl. on that other set, is a more a gripping Brtlnnhilde that Nilsson; a but Nilsson sings with more ease d and power. One particularly beau- 5- tiful moment is her soft utterance n of the name \"Siegfried,\" as she announces it to Sieglinde. Fs I sometimes wonder how much y Solti cares about vocal legato. His a Covent Garden Dutchman had so r little of it; and here Christa Le Ludwig's Pricka would be twice as is telling if her line were more smooth. Remember the quiet, â deadly scorn with which Maria von o Ilosvay used so beautifully to sing the phrases. Ludwig is vehement, g gusty-and in ringing voice. Frick t is a powerful Hunding, though \"F hollower in tone than when he e made the earlier set. st The sound is magnificent, rich, a spacious, grand, carefully balanced. r- The set costs Â£10 2s lid; the le Furtwingler set on HMV (mono is only, of course) costs Â£6 6s 3d. But when, oh when, will the con- 'o tract difficulties be cleared away r. and Furtwingler's complete Ring .1- recording (the great performance o- he conducted for the Italian radio, n with Flagstad) at last be released? vs Hans Hotter's recordings of the a- late '40s-four of them included ,r in a bargain price (25s 3d) r- anthology in HMV's Golden Voice !t- series (HQM 1030)-show very ,n clearly why at his prime he was d a Wotan. and a Hans Sachs, who le has spoilt us for any other. In his interpretation of these four 7 Schubert songs-Der Doppel- '- gsnger, Der Wanderer, and the two is called Wandrers Nachtlied-we 3- touch the heart of German roman- )- ticism, the mysterious melancholy, If self-questioning depths. The tone ie is noble poetic; the words are e, beautifully formed; the emotion is ly manly, dignified, but unrestrained a in its poignancy.",

It Is not often that two writers from the same newspaper bring out books on the same subject within a month of each other, but now It has happened with these two works on Khrushchev by Edward Crankshaw and Mark Frankland, both of The Observer. The two books are very differ- ently presented. Mr. Crankihaw's in hard coversn with pictures, foot- notes and an eloquent and discur- sive style. Mr. Frankland's a Pelican Original, no frills in the book production or In the style of writing. But when one gets beyond these differences, the two authors seem to be agreed about their sub- ject. They both see Khrushchev as a non-Intellectual, practical, ener. getic working-class politician, draw- ing emotional drive from the poverty'stricken background of his youth, Both agree that Khrukhchev, while understandably quiet about his own part in Stalin's great purges in the 'thirties, was deeply involved In them. Mr. Crankshaw, very properly, gives a good deal of chapter and verse to show the great extent to which Khrushchev publicly supported Stalin's purge policy. Yet later Mr. Crankehaw perhaps lets his moral indignation get In the way a bit too much. Mr. Prankland, I think, gets a better balance when he says in his closing sentence that Khrushchev \"left his country a better place than he found it, both In the eyes of the majority of his own people, and of the world.\" Both writers see as a high point In Khrushchev's career his \" secret speech \" to the 20th Party Con. @rasi In 1936.

   "text_content" : "At Friday's annual meeting of Tronoh Mines the shareiholder present-they were few in number -rested quietly under the benign influence of their chairman, Mr. George Simms, without asking a single question. Yet they had in front of them a man out of whose long experience and widespread knowledge of the tin-mining indus- try many an interesting .answer might have been forthcoming. And nobody can deny that in the tin share investment scene as it stands at the moment there is many a question to be put, although Mr. Simms had certainly given his views covering a large segment of the scene in his annual review which was commented on in our mining column of September 13. The share market as such has now become used to the mysterious workings of Mr. Callaghan's mind whereby if you are engaged in safe- guarding Britain's vital raw material lifelines you should be singled out for a particular and selective measure of fiscal punish- ment. The market has also had plenty of time to have a good look at the fact that such punishment is unfortunately being initially meted out at a time of decreased pros- perity owing to a setback in the tin price. Down Far Enough ? It can, in other words, be taken for granted that broadly speaking tin share prices have now fallen to an extent that should be discount- ing these two dispiriting elements in the prospects for current-year earnings .and distributions. As a particular and recent example of Mr. Callaghan's impact on divi- dends, the world's largest tin pro- ducer, Amalgamated of Nigeria, paid out 2s 9d a share for the year to March. 1965, which cost the company Â£637,000. If it wanted to pay the same rate for 1966-67 the cost would be over Â£lm. From the shareholder's viewpoint the com- pany would have, in fact, to be running very fast in order to stand still. In looking forward in the share market now, and bearing in mind that our tin share index is only 86.78 compared with just on 109 at the end of June, a fall of 20 per cent., the vital factors are the future course of the metal price and, for individual producers, the course of production. The tin price continues to be sus- pended at around Â£20 a ton above the level of Â£1,200 below which the International Tin Council's buffer stock manager can support the market if he so wishes. Whether or not he will be given this choice depends in turn largely on U.S. stockpile sales policy always pre- suming, of course, that demand is not going to be substantially punc- tured by any major dive in the economies of the world's principal consumers, notably in that of America. U.S. Factor Metal dealers Strauss and Co. put the situation quite bluntly at the end of their latest market re- view issued over the week-end when they say that during the coming six months there will have to be a sharp curtailment in stock- pile sales before the turn of the year in order to keep the tin price steady. If this does not happen prices, they predict, will break into the buffer stock range and the manager thereof may find himself having to buy some of the surplus metal caused by the U.S. sales. Bolivia has already started making pleas to the American Government for a reduction in these sales on the grounds that its economy is being damaged by the setback in the metal price to even its present relatively high level. The U.S. has always expressed its intention of tapering offprings at times when prices seem likely to be unduly depressed thereby and, although America is not a member of the International Tin Agree- ment, there is no evidence that it would want to press sales to the extent of their having to be taken into that body's buffer stock.. A price of Â£1,200 a ton is 15 per cent. below the 1965 average of Â£1,413 so tin producers who are not increasing their outputs will be making lower profits anyway. As our cumulative table of. Sep- tember 17 showed, mines with current-year outputs flowing above those of a year ago include Berjuntai, Geevor, Gold and Base of Nigeria, Hongkong, Petaling and Tronoh. Berjuntai Brokers out east tend to wax particularly lyrical about Berjuntai and Petaling, partly because they are Malaysian companies and thus escape Mr. -Callaghan's hammer blows while they are, of course, perfectly free if profits warrant it to pay out more to their share- holders. One Kuala Lumpur firm, in fact, goes so far as to say in its latest circular to clients that Berjuntai at 32s 6d can be described as \" nothing else but an outstandingly good buy both to local and U.K. investors. This low level may never be reached again in the history of * the company.' This is, of course, sticking their neck out a bit far but the firm has a good record of responsibility in its Tin share pre- dictions. The present facts about Berjuntai is that a dividend total equivalent to 3s 6d has been de- clared for the year to last April on the capital as increased by last March's 1-for-2 scrip issue. This gives the shares a yield basis of 10.8 per cent. In the first four months of the current year pro- duction has totalled 1,534% tons of concentrates compared with 1,387% tons at this tune a year ago. Petaling has produced 1,116 tons for the ten months of its year to October 31 compared with only 880% tons for the same period of 1964-65 when the year's total was 1,083% tons. The shares are 10s 6d, a 1966 low, and the yield on the 35 per cent. dividend is 7.8 per cent. The interim for the current year has been maintained at 15 per cent WMC and Copper There have been many things to boost the price of Western Mining Corporation this year; the shares rose 7s to 51s last week following my outlining of an Australian broker's views about them here last Monday. One of the factors that caused a speculative burst of en- thusiasm earlier this year was the announcement that prospecting rights were being sought in the Warburton Range native reserve in Western Australia. Copper was the target. And, it is now revealed, the treatment of 180 tons of chalcocite ore averaging 36 per cent. copper was the bait. In case this creates too much renewed excitement it should be pointed out that indivi- dual showings of copper in this district tend to be small. But they extend over a length of some 70 miles within the company's pros- pecting area of 1,475 square miles, an area that has not hitherto been systematically prospected. Western Mining's hope is that the showings may indicate the existence of large tonnages of bedded ore and appreciable ton- nages of high-grade ore in narrow veins. Geochemical and geophysi- cal surveying is now beginning.",

   "text_content" : "In July the estimated fire damage sustained in the United Kingdom amounted to Â£9%m. This figure is about 50 per cent. above the recent monthly average and has only once been exceeded-in December 1964, when the Bishopsgate fire pushed the monthly figure to just short of Â£14m. The Â£86m. estimate of damage for the 12 months ending July this year is close on 25 per cent. up on the comparable figure for the previous 12 months, and unless there is a considerable improve- ment in the next few months the total for the calendar year 1966 could perhaps approach Â£100m. Main Causes The Fire Protection Association reports that in 1965 there were 83.000 fires, just over double the 1955 total. In 1965 there were 777 \"large\" fires-a large fire is one causing Â£10,000 damage or more-which caused total damage of Â£44%m. Four \"monster\" fires occurred In each of which damage amounted to Lim. The four main causes of fire are defective electrical wiring and apparatus, rubbish burning, children with fire raising materials, and smoking materials. It may be trite, but it is nevertheless true that the first remedy for all these Is far greater care on the part of management staff and the public generally. he S.P.A, reports a 81niflcant growth in the number of known cases of arson: most fires of this kind are started out- side normal working hours and are usually the work of intruders, The first remedy here lies in the hands of occupiers to prevent easy access by unsecured gate doors and windows, But even with the greatest care fires will still occur: and therefore In addition the In' stallation of modern fire preven. tion equipment Is essential, Quite apart from the national loss in factories, warehouses, offices and stocks, which can scarcely be afforded at any time, let alone the present, this year's figures so far bode ill for any profit in insurers' home tire accounts this year, and may cause insurers to consider a further in- crease in the general level of fire rates, for those policyholders who do not install modern fire preven. tion equipment. To the financial incentive already given by Fire insurers, by way of rate reduction for say sprinkler installations, is now added the attraction of State aid under the Industrial Development Act, 1966, which received Royal Assent last month. All firms in the production and extractive .industries who install fire prevention equipment now qualify for a grant of 20% of the cost, while those in development areas qualify for a further 20%. (These grants are also available for the Installation of anti-burglar and industrial safety equipment.) A Tax Saving Say the B.I.A., a sprinkler In- stallation can pay for itself in 3 to 5 years, the precise period depend. Ing on where the firm is situate. The following are their figures for a saw mill in a development area. Â£ Firm's sum Insured ...... 125,000 Gross cost of sprinkler .., 9.000 less 40% Industrial De- velopment Act Grant ... 3,600 Â£5,400 per year Gross insurance premium 2,425 Discount (55%) sprinkler installation ............... 1333 Net Insurance premium ... 1,092 In addition there will be a tax saving: again taking the B.I.A. figures, which are calculated on the basis of straight line depreciation, 6% per cent. for 16 years on net installation cost, the saving will amount to a further Â£135 per year. assuming corporation tax at 40 per cent. Thus qualifying firms have now no adequate financial reason for 4 failing both to reduce their fire risks and to reduce the nation's bill of fire wastage: if this kind of in- centive fails it is doubtful whether any other can succeed, short of refusal by insurers to give cover.",

   "text_content" : "ACHIEVEMENT AND PROSPECTS By GEORGE COLLEY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE The vital role of industrial expansion in the development of the economy of modem Ireland has been brought out clearly by the achievements of the Indus- trial sector under the First Pro- gramme for Economic Expan- sion (1958-63) and has been further emphasised by the more ambitious targets set for industry in the Second Programme (cover- ing the period to 1970). The significance of industrial expan- sion is epitomised in the follow- terms in the Second Programme itself: \"The expansion of the indus- trial sector is a key objective, because the reduction in emigration, the improvement in productivity and the expansion in services all depend primarily on its achievement.\" The First Programme had aimed at an annual increase in GNP of 2 per cent. This was not a target but a deliberately modest forecast of what action on the lines of the Programme might be relied on to achieve. In the event, an increase in GNP of about 4* per cent a year was achieved, with the contribution of the industrial sector at a rate slightly in excess of 7 per cent. A similar target has been set for industry in the period to 1970 in which it is again expected to be the main agent of economic growth. Moreover, should agricultural growth, for any reason, fall short of 2.7 per cent. per annum, industry would be expected to step up its contri- bution further. Further Expansion But while industrial expansion under the First Programme was helped by the existence of under- utilised capacity, further expan- sion will have to be achieved in circumstances of freer trade and of more intense cqmpetition. ip this situation, the two majdr aspects of industrial expansion will be, as indeed they have been for some years past, new indus- trial development and the adaptation of existing industries to meet conditions of freer trade. New industrial development is, of course, aimed at broaden- ing and deepening the industrial base of the economy and involves in many cases the attraction here of new industrial skills and techniques or new entrepreneurial skills. Industrial grants, supplemented by fiscal incentives, are the main induce- ments offered by the Govern- ment to attract new industry; the promotional effort is the responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority. The importance of this aspect of industrial development may be judged from the fact that one- third of the increase in gross output and one-half of the increase in industrial exports which it is aimed to achieve by 1970 is expected to come from new firms established since 1960. Since 1959, 189 new industries, or extensions, involving external participation have gone into production. While new industrial develop- ment will be needed to an ever. increasing degree, the main burden of the task of achieving the 1970 targets will fall on existing firms. Many of these firms were established to cater for, or have been depending to a great extent on, the protected home market, and they must now face the task of adapting themselves so that their pro- ducts will progressively achieve the highest standards of com- petitiveness in home and export markets alike. Adaptation Process This problem of adaptation is one to which a great deal of attention has been given in recent years. The urgency which attached to this task when membership of the EEC seemed imminent was not diminished when our application for membership had to be post- poned, and this urgency has now been further emphasised by the coming into force on July 1, of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. The sine qua non for our indus- trial expansion is, of course, the development and expansion of export markets. For Ireland, with a small home market, exports have a critical import- ance as a source of growth and it is only by winning sufficient export orders against growing competition from other countries that the expansion in production and employment envisaged in the Second Programme can be maintained. It is worth noting that in the ten years 1955 to 1965 total exports increased, in value terms, from Â£110m. to Â£244m.: in real (for example volume) terms they nearly doubled. Vital Trends Behind these global figures lie some very significant trends. For instance, the list of manufac- tures increased from some 500 itemW in 1955 to 800 in 1965, some of the new hems being of considerable significance, for example, chemicals and pharma- ceuticals, building materials, and metals. The task that confronts our exporters is, however, quite formidable, as the 1970 export target is Â£385m. (at 1960 prices). The contribution expected from the industrial sector is even more striking, for we find that in 1970 industrial exports are expected to amount in value to Â£209m. as compared with Â£51.1m. in 1960, Â£90.7m. in 1964 and Â£104.5m. in 1965. These figures dramatically underline the importance of industrial expansion, both by way of new development and adaptation of existing industries; obviously, too, a number of firms not now exporting will have to do so. The essential groundwork for successful ex- porting will continue to be pro- vided through the promotional work of Coras Trachtdla (the Irish Export Board), but this promotional work alone will not suffice to achieve the necessary expansion. This will depend, in the last analysis, on the efforts of the individual firms. State Aid A feature of the Irish indus- trial scene is the existence of a number of State-sponsored firms engaged in manufacturing. These were established in the first in- stance for reasons of public policy or because it was con- sidered unlikely that private enterprise would take the initia- tive in a particular field. The activities undertaken by such firms include the production of sugar, steel and nitrogenous fertilisers. The general policy of the Government for these enter- prises visualises that private enterprise, while continuing to be the mainspring of economic ad- vancement would be stimulated, encouraged and, where neces- sary, complemented by public ,enterprise so that all productive Verolme Cork Dockyard, Cobb, Co. Cork. resources are fully employed. The entry of the Irish Sugai Company into food processing in recent years and the establish' ment of a State-sponsored nitro genous fertiliser factory have been in accordance with this policy. These two developments apart, there has been no signifi. cant diversification or extension of their activities by State- controlled manufacturing enter- prises in recent years. All of them have expanded their output and employment since 1958, but in general it cannot be said that the public sector of manufac. turing industry has been ex- panded to the same degree as the private sector. While the presence or absence of particular natural resources can profoundly influence a country's industrial develop ment. future expansion now depends less on natural advan. tages and home market needs than on the initative and enter prise of private individuals and groups and on the determination of the nation as a whole to pro gress. Ireland to-day is poised for such development; indeed such development is vital. All this has been clearly underlined by the preliminary report, jusl published,. on the 1966 Census of Population. This shows an increase in population of 62,00C (or 2.2 per cent.) since 1961, while emigration in the same period dropped to 85,000 com- pared with 212,000 in the period 1956 to 1961. This increase is in sharp contrast with the falls in population in the two preced- ing intercensal periods, and re- verses the trend shown in all cen- suses since 1841, except that of 1951 which recorded an increase of less than 6,000. The figures just published, though not unex- pected, should greatly stimulate our efforts to expand and improve. Freer Trade The widespread public accep- tance of the importance of industrial expansion confirmed by the Second Programmne, the -attention now being given by Irish firms to exports, the extent to which adaptation is taking place, all reflect growing recogni. tion of the need for greater in- dustrialisation and for adapta- tion and change in the face of freer trade. The prospect of freer trade has been increasingly brought home to Irish indus- trialists by the decision to apply for membership of the EEC, by the examination of Irish industry in preparation for such member- ship undertaken some years ago by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, and by the reduc- tions in our protective tariffs. Despite all these moves, there were undoubtedly some people who, especially when action on our application for EEC mem- bership was postponed, felt un- certain about the pace and extent of the movement towards freer trade. Any such uncertainty has now been removed by the Anglo. Irish Free Trade Area Agree- ment which has brought us face- to-face with the reality of free trade. Apart from its psycho. logical effect, the Agreement is a most important development in its bearing on future expansion and exports. On the industrial side, the removal of the duties on articles, especially of textiles, containing man-made fibres is the .most important advantage. The abolition of this duty opens up new prospects for a wide variety of products particularly clothing, carpets and woven and knitted fabrics. While it is clear that the Agreement will provide new trading advantages it is not pos- sible to calculate with precision what effect it will have in the industrial sector. Much will depend on the energy shown by individual firms in utilising the opportunities to expand exports. It is clear too that the Agreement offers new opportunities for ex- panding the industrial base. Thus, one can say that the Agree. ment presents to Irish industry, at one and the same time, a serious challenge and a great opportunity. S. hit : tI, , 1. '.! i r. nr",

   "text_content" : "Ireland is heavily dependent on foreign trade. A small country with limited domestic in. dustrial resources, she must look to other countries for supplies of the materials and equipment she needs to maintain and de- velop her industries and for out- lets for her increasing production of manufactured goods. At the same time, adequate and re munerative markets for her ex. ports of live animals, food and food preparations are essential to the prosperity of her agricul- ture, which wll always occupy an important place in the economy. Commodity imports in 1965 represented 37 per cent. and commodity exports 22 per cent. of ONP. In the past, Ireland's external trade has been largely an ex- change of exports of agricultural products for imports of food- stuffs not produced in Ireland, raw materials, manufactured goods and fuel This pattern has been changing as a result of developments in both the indus- trial and agricultural sectors and of changes in export markets. Thanks to the building up of an industrial sector, most of the country's requirements of con- sumer goods are now supplied by home production and recent years have witnessed a striking expansion of exports of manu- factures. Import Reduction On the agricultural side, in. creased home production has re- duced imports of sugar and certain other products, while some traditional agricultural ex- ports have been affected adversely by the support policies of the United Kingdom and other major importers. Ireland's imports and exports totalled Â£371.6m. and 2239m,, respectively, in 1965, giving a trade deficit of Â£147.7m. The ;ommodity composition is ahown in the accompanying table. The pace of economic development is reflected in an increase in imports of capital goods. Expressed as a percentage Ds total imports they rose from 10.7 per cent in 1960 to 16.2 per :ent. in 1965. The proportion accounted for by consumption goods ready for use has been fairly constant at about 21 per cent. Table I shows the still lominant. position of agricul- tural products in Irish exports. However, the share of agri- cultural, fishing and forestry products in total exports has declined in recent years while that of industrial products has risen from 26 per cent. in 1958 to 37 per cent. in 1965. The geographical distribution of Ireland's external trade is given in Table II. The U.C's share of tol Irish exports has declined fro 87 per cent. in 1955 to 70 p cent. in 1965, while that the EEC member States h increased from 4 per cent. 13 per cent. Britain's Share The percentage of total Iri imports supplied by the UJ has remained at roughly 50 p cent. since 1955. Ireland is fact Britain's ninth hight customer in order of importan and her place in the Briti export league table may well as a result of the imp] mentation of the Free Tra Area Agreement. The share the EEC in Irish imports ro from 12 per cent. in 1955 15 per cent. in 1965. T largest individual supplic among EEC countries are G< many, France and the Nethe lands, while Japan is t most important among \"oth countries.\" Normally Ireland's trade wi the United Kingdom is fail evenly balanced, while that wi all her other trading partne shows a substantial import e cess. A welcome development recent years is a tendency f the trade deficit with EEC narrow. In 1955 the ratio w 5 to I against Ireland; in 19 it had fallen to 2 to 1. Ireland's overall trade defir is financed to a substantial c gree by net invisible receil (principally tourism, investme income and emigrants' rem tances), which over the yet 1957 to 1961, balanced the i port excess. Since then the tra gap has tended to widen mc rapidly than the rate of grow in net invisible receipts and t balance of payments has shon growing deficits which reach il Â£41.8m. In 1965. Corrective n measures taken in the course of ;r 1965 brought about an improve- if ment in the trade balance in the s second half of 1965 which has o continued in the present year. The factors which will exert a major influence on Ireland's trade in the years immediately b ahead are the pace of her economic development, the t implementation of the Free 1 Trade Area Agreement and the t I economic conditions in her r e export markets, particularly the h United Kingdom. The Second Programme for e Economic Expansion, which e: I covers the period up to 1970, ii a postulates an increase of 50 per a 0 cent. in GNP in 1970 over 1960, a or an annual rate of increase of d 4.3 per cent. over the years 1964 5 to 1970. The most recent ti estimate (January, 1966) of the related growth in external trade le is that, at 1960 prices, imports r will increase from Â£226.2m. in h 1960 (Â£352.7m. in 1965) to E Â£500m. in 1970 and exports from a y Â£147.8m. in 1960 (Â£203.3m. in A 1965) to Â£385m. in 1970. t. . The influence of the Anglo- li n Irish Free Trade Area Agree- a r ment on the trend of trade was o o taken into account in the pre- ei a paration of this estimate. The g 5 direct trading advantages which b Ireland gains from the Agree- p it ment operate from July 1, 1966, o >. when British protective duties on ii ts - it I Irish goods were eliminated and the special concessions for Irish Sstore animals and carcase meat \" took effect. The dismantling of , Irish protection against British 0 goods is to take place over a transitional period of nine years r ending July, 1975, and it is i expected that competition from . imports of British manufactures r will not become really acute until . after July, 1970, when import f duties will have been reduced to .50 per cent of the rates in opera. tion in June, 1966. Industrial Output The National Industrial ' Economic Council in its com- ments on the Free Trade Area Agreement says that, with adap- tation and the continued estab- lishment of new firms, the annual average increase in the volume a of industrial output (7 per cent.) envisaged in the Second Pro- e gramme for 1960-70 appears to i be attainable during the whole period 1965-75, though the rate i, of expansion during 1970-75 will, a in the light of present know- ledge, be slower than during 1965-70. The high ratio of Ireland's axports to her GNP and the large proportion of her exports which find an outlet on the British market make the Irish rconomy highly sensitive to :hanging conditions in the U.K. and particularly to measures to reduce imports in the interest of the British balance of payments. The British import surcharge had a severe effect on Irish ex- ports of industrial goods and the announcement of the U.K. Government's intention to termi- ate it on November 30, 1966, was greeted with relief. We are concerned, however, about the implications for us of the economic measures recently an- nounced by the British Govern- ment. These, through their influence on demand in the U.K., will react on our growth pros- pects. They make more urgent the task of improving our rela- tive competitiveness so as to maintain the growth of our ex- ports both to the U.K. and to other markets. ;Â·~~e\" ~3LC~li) ~~Â¶1 5Y)I~?X:`)SIIFL~I J LPU TABLE I COMMODITY COMPOSITION OF IRISH IMPORTS AND EXPORTS-1965 (Current prices) Imports Total Exports Â£ooos % Â£o000 % Live animals, food and food preparation .......... 64,822 17 125,346 56 Drink and tobacco ........ 7,498 2 8,058 4 Raw materials except fuels 25,725 7 11,529 5 Mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials ........ 31,401 8 389 2 Animal and vegetable oils and fats ................ 2204 1 74 - Chemicals ............. 32,398 9 4,797 2 Machinery and transport equipment ........... 93,193 25 10,222 5 Other manufactured goods 96,402 26 42,235 19 Pariel post and special trans- actions ................ 17,990 5 11,810 5 Roexports . e .......... - - 5,900 2 Total ................ 371,632 100 223,941 100 TABLE II GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF IRELAND'S TRADE IN 1965 Import Imports Exports Excess Â£000 % Â£000 % Â£000 1.

The net inflow of capital in the past four years has averaged almost Â£30m. a year.

The Importance of foreign in. dustrial investment to the Repub. lie may be judged by the fact that well over a quarter of the industrial growth projected for the current decade is expected to come from new industries, almost all of which are ex. ternally financed.

   "text_content" : "Internal transport in Ireland is served by a road and rail network with road transport predominating. The country's railway system is operated over about 1.500 miles of line by C6ras lompair Eireann, the national transport undertaking, which also operates urban and provincial bus services as well as a wide network of road freight services, including con- tainer services. In addition to the CIE S services, local omnibus services, mainly in rural areas, are pro- vided by a number of private operators who are licensed for this purpose, but the traffic car- ried by them is relatively small. dc Nearly 1,000 road hauliers, lo1 mostly firms operating one lorry, 11, are licensed to carry merchan- gr dise for reward; such haulage th p for reward is not controlled in thi exempted areas around the in larger ports. 19 Lines Closed st Since 1958 CIE have closed V over 600 miles of railway line Lt and over 200 stations, and have se carried out a complete re- Ir organisation and modernisation Li of the railway system, including Ri the substitution of diesel for iti the remaining steam-operated services, the provision of new r carriages and wagon stock of modem design, and the mechanisation of freight traffic handling.

Government to secure . greater Irish participation in this trade, which is so vital to the country and with this end in view the Government, in 1965, acquired at a cost of Â£3.6m. the British and Irish Steam Packet Co. Ltd. (more generally known as the \" B. and I I.\"), a subsidiary of Coast Lines Ltd. Cargo and livestock liner services are now provided on the - Irish Sea by the B. and I., the 1 Limerick Steamship Co., British 9 Rail, and by Coast Lines and r its subsidiaries. Passenger services between Ireland and Britain are also provided by British Rail and the B. and I., as well as by Burns and Laird, a Coast Lines sub- sidiary. These services are like- ' wise of major importance to Ireland, since the development * of tourist traffic depends to a very great extent on the avail- ability of efficient shipping ser- vices between the two countries. The improvements carried out in 1965 to the mail boats operat- ing on the Holyhead-Din Laoghaire route and the intro- duction of drive-on/drive-off car 1 ferry services on the Ddn Laoghaire and Rosslare routes have been welcomed by travellers.

To-day the air routes from Ireland extend far into Europe and across the Atlantic to the eastern seaboard of North America. To cater for the air services an infrastructure of first-class air- ports, air traffic control, com- munications, maintenance and meteorological services has been developed. The process of de- velopment is a continuing one. Designing and planning is directed at ensuring the adequacy of the facilities for the ever- changing demands, both traffic and operational, of larger and faster aircraft particularly the jumbo and supersonic jets. The three State airports were developed at a cost to date of nearly Â£12m. Dublin Air- port, situated on the east coast, is naturally oriented to the British and European markets while Shannon Airport serves as the country's gateway for the trans-Atlantic traffic. Cork Air- port serves the populated and touristically attractive south- west with services to Dublin, Britain and the Continent Last year the airports catered for nearly 2m. passengers. National Airline The responsibility for the de- velopment of Irish air services has been entrusted to the national airline Aer Lingus Irish Inter- national Airlines, which operates frequent and regular passenger and freight services with the most modern jet equipment. Short haul routes are operated from the three State airports at Dub. lin, Cork and Shannon to British and Continental cities, most of the routes being shared and some pooled with airlines of other countries. A car ferry service to Britain and France is also pro- vided though competition from the new sea ferry leaves its future viability in doubt. Ser- vices are also operated to Bos- ton, New York, Chicago and Montreal. Besides the scheduled services charter flights and inclu- sive tours are operated. Aviation is a rapidly develop- ing means of communication but as yet is far from a true realisa- tion of its potential. Ireland's planners anticipated the eventual emergence of that realisation so that full Irish participation is assured in this new and exciting phenomenon of moder times.",

   "text_content" : "The Irihh Cedar, a raed vo Irbih Shipplan. * Lacking the demagogic quali- ties of a Harold Wilson and the emotional, appeal of an Eamon de Valera, Scan Letnass, Prime Minister of Ireland since 1959, nevertheless bestrides the national scene. The reason is only partly that he remains, with the exception of Frank Aiken, Minister for External Affairs, the solitary survivor of Mr. de Valera's original Cabinet, and as such enjoys a prestige ranging back over 34 years. What matters more is that he has demonstrated himself, during his seven years in the Premiership, to be the boss and manipulator of the well-drilled Fianna Fail Party, and also that he has borne abundant witness to his dedication to the economic advancement of a country in sore need of it irrespective of all such side- issues as the promotion of the Irish language-to which, how- ever, he pays occasional dutiful homage. National Progress As Lemass is firmly dedi- cated to the cause of national progress, and convinced of the rightness of the means he has accepted towards that end, he would be prepared, I believe, to offer his resignation if he thought that any other hand than his could guide the nation towards prosperity. But the likelihood of such a hand emerging Is remote. The fact so far has been that no alternative Government exists to Fianna Fail, and Lemass is probably the first to deplore it. It is indeed a depress- ing thought. People in thei Re-. public are 'apt to criticise the Six Counties of Northern Ireland on the ground that a Unionist Government has been in unbroken office there for 45- odd years, and to forget that in the South-where jerrymander- ing does not exist and there is no such thing as a built-in majority-the Fianna Pail supremacy has existed for 33 years, interrupted only by two short intervals amounting to six years in all. This is not a healthy situation. Lemass probably welcomes the challenge from the now renascent Fine Gael, the phoenix-like coterie of the men, and their sons, who established the Irish Free State during the 'twenties and who have since maintained the main burden of opposition to Fianna Fail in Dail Eireann, the national House of Commons. The self- assurance of Fine Gael has been enormously enhanced by the result of the Presidential election that took place at the beginning of June. A walk-over victory was expected for President de Valera, already seven yea's in office, a world-recognised and nationally all - but - sanctified figure, against whom Mr. T. P. O'Higgins, the Fine Gael candi- date, should have been an ineffective opponent. In fact, Mr. O'Higgins came within an ace of unseating -the national hero: the margin of votes between them was only a little more than 10,000 out of a total poll of more than a million. \"Youth\" Campaign The Fine Gael campaign on this occasion was based on .a need for \".youth,\" and \"young thinking\" as opposed to the \"antiquated \" philosophy which bad hitherto dominated Irish politics. This may have been begging the question, since the average age of Mr. Lemass's existing Ministry is a good deal less than that, say, of Mr. Wilson's, and no higher than that of any Ministry likely to be furnished by Fine Gael itself. Nonetheless, the party presents a decalogic programme which, while enormously attractive, being based on the programmes of the more advanced European States, gives rise to some doubts as to its practibility. The Odds It would be pleasant to think of an alternative Government to that of Mr. Lemass. The :ountry would be politically, and perhaps economically, in a ealthier condition if there were. On the basis, indeed, of the Presi- Jential election results, the odds are that Fine Gael will acquire many seats at the next general lection; yet, even if that elec- tion is postponed to the last. possible minute of 1969, and even if economic circumstances prove to be blacker than anyone :an imagine, it is difficult to Foresee the party's acquisition of a majority entitling it to inde- pendent government. There is no strong possibility of a coali- tion with Labour, such as existed in 1948-51 and again in 1954-57. The utmost that could happen would be an anti-Fianna Fail majority vote of such proportion that Fine Gael would be required to constitute a Government dependent on Labour support, and consequently vulnerable. This is the basis of Lemass's trength apd selEfgsuranqq. Nc statesman in Eturdpe its prettiqir. Politics apart, it has not been one of the Republic's better years. But a great stride forward has been made towards a more decent relationship between North and South, and for that both Premiers have every right to claim credit. Nobody knows oil whose initiative - there clearly must have been some preliminary understanding - Captain O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, travelled secretly to Dublin in the first month of last year to break a 40-year-old tradition of personal estrangement from his opposite number in the South. But the meeting has been productive of nothing but good, and proper Irishmen of all sorts have -wel- comed it. Captain O'Neill, admittedly, has faced trouble from extremists headed by the Reverend Ian Paisley, whose activities have re- ceived world-wide publicity. But Captain O'Neill has shown no signs of regretting his liberal attitude towards the South. All the evidence is that Ulster Pro- testant opinion is behind him. Trade Concessions The South itself whole- heartedly approves, these ad- vances towards co-operation. No less convinced of the inevit- ability of national unity than the Northern majority is of its British heritage, it has neverthe- less taken most kindly to the new approaches, which promise to go far beyond the existing and very practical contacts be- tween the two Governments. It is a pity, perhaps, that such trade concessions as have been made by the Republic to North- ern imports should. have dis- appointed th.busineba men of Belfast",

   "article_dc_title" : "A New Potential for Agriculture",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-26",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "In Ireland, nearly one-third of the population is engaged in agriculture; 60 per cent. of total exports consists of agricultural products; and agriculture accounts for about one-fifth of the national income. There is no other country in Western Europe where agriculture occupies so important a place in the national economy. As in other countries, of course, industrial development is going ahead rapidly and the relative share of industry in total production and exports is steadily advancing. A consider- able sector of Irish industry, however, is engaged in the pro- cessing of agricultural products for home and export markets, and it is very probable that, even when industrialisation has pro- ceeded as far as it has in coun- tries such as Denmark and Hol- land which were formerly so predominantly agricultural, the food and other raw materials produced by Irish agriculture will continue to be the basis of very many important Irish in- dustries. Agriculture, therefore, will always be of great signifi- cance in the economy. Export Industry Irish agriculture is pre- eminently an export industry. Its well-being and future growth are very much bound up with export markets. Like most other agri- cultural exporting countries, Ire- land experienced difficulties after the war in securing remunerative export markets for food. At the same time, imported raw materials, machinery and finished goods became dearer, and the terms of trade moved against us. This, of course, was only another example of a worldwide econo- mic problem--the growth of agricultural protectionism and the introduction of high price upports for domestic agricul- ure in the main. industrial :ountries which traditionally wrovided the only substantial narket for the products of the igricultural exporting countries. As is well known, while the ,enefits of international free rade for industrial products iave been securing increased >ractical recognition ever since he war, international agricul- ural trade has been hindered by L vast network of restrictions and levices of all kinds. Free Trade Area It was against this background that we entered into the trade negotiations with the United Kingdom which eventually re- mlted in the signing of the Free rrade Area Agreement in December, 1965. Until then, trade between the two countries was regulated by the Trade Agreements of 1938, 1948 and 1960. The 1938 Agreement was the basic one, but it was an Agreement made in pre-war con- ditions and had, from the agri- cultural point of view, gradually become outdated in relation to the very different economic and trade circumstances of both countries in the 1960s. The Free Trade Area Agree- ment does not, of course, provide a \"Common Market\" in agri- culture between the two countries. What it does is to provide for the freeing of import restrictions against British industrial pro- ducts over a ten-year period, in return for improved arrange. ments in relation to the market- ing of Irish agricultural products in the United Kingdom, as well as the removal of some remain- ing British restrictions on imports of Irish industrial goods such as man-made fibres. Twofold Bargain The agricultural arrangements are twofold. First, they provide satisfactory assurances about access for Irish agricultural, horticultural and fishery products to the British market. Previously, the U.K. had the right to regu- late imports of any Irish agricul- tural or fishery product in the interests of \" orderly marketing,\" subject only to prior consultation with the Irish Government. The new arrangement was, of course, an essential base for any future development of Irish agricultural production and exports. Second, important price sup- port arrangements for some of our principal agricultural pro- ducts were obtained. The British Government undertook to extend annually to 25,000 tons of Irish carcase beef and 5,500 tons of Irish lamb, the full sup- port price guaranteed to British producers of fat cattle and fat lambs. In addition, the \" waiting period\" prescribed for Irish store cattle and store sheep on British farms before they qualify for the British fatstock guarantee payments was reduced from A rail of dresed beet carcaseo for export at the Inter. national Meat Compacy factory in Dublin. three to two months, and an unconditional guarantee was given by the British Govern- ment regarding unrestricted access for Irish store cattle fc. all time. These two basic features of the Agreement-satisfactory assurances of access to the British market for our agricul- tural, horticultural and fishery products, and British price support for Irish cattle and sheep through the agreed arrangements in regard to Irish carcase meat and store animals-provide a solid and permanent foundation for the agricultural expansion envisaged in our Second Pro- gramme for Economic Expan- sion. The agricultural \" target\" of this Programme is an increase of one-third in gross agricultural product between 1960 and 1970, which would mean an increase of 80 per cent. in the volume of agricultural exports, the greater part consisting of cattle, meat and other livestock products. Clearly, therefore, it was essential to make sure that export outlets would be avail. able for the projected increase in exports, and this has been assured by the Free Trade Area Agreement. Good Progress There can be no doubt that the potential of Irish agriculture, horticulture and fisheries has not yet been anything like fully realised. The Second Programme targets are derived from a realis- tic study of the possibilities of expansion, and the effort to achieve them is being backed by a substantial increase in Govern- ment investment in agriculture and in an expansion of the agri- cultural education, advisory and research services. The progress made by Irish agriculture since 1960 has been substantial. Gross output has in- creased in volume by 1S per cent. and the value of agricul- tural exports by 45 per cent. The total number of cattle (our most important export industry) has gone up by over 900,000 (20 per cent.), and the increase in sheep and lamb numbers has been of about the same order. There are now about 1.6m. cows in the country, as compared with 1.2- 1.3m. which was the maximum achieved before the inauguration of the Second Programme. The Problems Of course, we also have our problems. One of them is that we are still faced with price vicissitudes in export markets. The economic division of Europe is another. We look for- ward to the day when Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Norway will all become members of the European Economic Community. It is our belief that this is a desirable and, indeed, essential development for the future of European agriculture as well as for general economic and political reasons. We consider that the Free Trade Area Agreement with the U.K., as well as being valuable in itself, will facilitate the entry of both countries into the European Community when the time is ripe.",

   "text_content" : "Economic discussion in Ireland has been dominated over the last eight years by the Government's Programmes for Economic Expansion. These programmes were conceived less as plans than as indicative statements of aims and expectations, but they have been taken so seriously by those whose decisions influence the level of economic activity that they have become something far more concrete tban mere pious hopes. It is probably true to say that the publication of every set of important economic statistics results in careful comparisons between the targets set in the programmes and the actual results achieved. The per. formance of agriculture as a whole has, perhaps, not been quite as good as was expected, but I think that there can be no doubt of the significant progress being made in the important dairying sector. Policy's Kernel The kernel of the agricultural policy, perhaps, indeed, of the whole programme, Is the target st for cattle output-1.5m. head in 1970 against 1,046.000 In 1960. an Increase of 454.000 or 43 per cent,, almost all of which will be for export. But in order to achieve thli level of output the programme stated that it would be necessary to increase the number of cows to around 1.7m, by 1963-that Is, by some 380,000 (29 per cent,) over the number in June, 1963, \"An inevitable concomitant of increased cattle production Is an Increase In milk productlon, the 1966 will be about 690m. gallons, 12 per cent. more than in 1963. By 1970, if the expected improve- ments in average yield are obtained, the larger herd should produce about 840m. gallons of milk. As domestic consumption of dairy produce is already on the high side in Ireland, and un- likely to change appreciably over the next few years, it might be expected that in 1970 we would be exporting up to 40 per cent. of our total production in various forms. Comparable Figure The comparable figure for 1966 is about 29 per cent, so it is clear that we have already made considerable strides. An Bord Balnne, or the Irish Dairy Produce Marketing Board, which was established by the State in 1961 to centralise the export marketing of all Irish dairy pro. duce, is now the largest exporter in the whole country, and is responsible, either directly or In* directly, for foreign sales worth over I21m. per annum. Pre. eminent among the products handled by the Board is the \"Kerrygold\" brand of Irish creamery butter sold throughout Britain. Out of total butter pro. duction this year of about 60,000 tons, 24,000 tons will be aex ported, and two-thirds of this will be sold on the British main. land. The success achieved In selling an Irish product in this most competitive of markets and in obtaining for it a premium price equalled by few other suppliers, is a source of great confidence to the Board when it contemplates the future. Irish products have for so long been practically un* known in Britain, let alone more distant markets that the sight of British housewives insisting on \"Kerrygold\" butter-and not bocsuse It is chap-has proved to i an inspiration, not only to the Board, but to all Irish exportenr. Our cheese, also, gVn n Impetus by the quality mk scheme introduced by the rish Government, and by new methods of chese grading, to also leaving the country in greater volume than ever, Ten years ago we exported 270 tons of choses to BritainW this year the figure will be over 10,000 tons, Beit Outlet With butter and cbese, as with most oter dairy products Cho British market remains, and likely to remain for some years, our most Important outlet. But fears expresud In A oe qartes tht Britainmay be looed with heap rish milk an ik VuOt Are quits omweal now products held by Ireland are mostly inslgnificant-3.7 per cent. of the butter market, 3.6 per cent. of the cheese market, and 10 per cent. and 7 per cent. respectively for the whole and skim milk powder markets. Only in the case of chocolate crumb does the Irish share become significant (33 per cent.) and this is due to special institutional factors. Life would be easier (some would say more dangerous) if we could dispose of all our produce in the U.K.: however, we cannot, and, like the other important dairy producers, we find ourselves scouring the far corners of the world for now outlets. The U.K. so dominates the world market for so many dairy products that it is not always easy to find alternative markets in which the volume of sales attained is likely to repay the efforts involved in establish* ing a product, However, we have managed to win a large share of the West Indies butter market (now the largest packet butter market In the world after Britain) and we are also selling signiflcant quantties of butter in the Persian Gulf, In the Mediterraneah countries and In North Africa, while our cheese finds its way to Continental Europe and to the U.S. Board's Aim In the long run, the arbiters of the Board's success as a mar. koting agency for Irish dairy Sroduce will be the dairy armers and the taxpayers of this country. World dairy pro. duce markets being what they are, few countries are able to dispose of their products profit. ab, and the aim of An Bord Damne-the marketing arm of the Irish dairy Industry-is to maximise the ups and minimise the downs of this difflcult mar. ket equation. The b slo cost competilveness of Ir sh milk production is to some extent nullified by the present topsy. turvy economics of world dairy produce, The Irish Government Is determined that our 104,000 creamery milk suppliers should enjoy a standard of living com. parable to that enjoyed by urban dwellers, and furthermore, it rooiniess the need to n coura a the dairy Industry if its oate output tar ts are to be attained. Cattle an mllk, taken together, contribute 52 per cent, of gross aIoultural output and two. thirds of total agricultural ex. Sorts.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Sks Heau, Co. Kerry. In recent years tourism has become more important to Ireland than to any other nation in Europe with the possible exceptions of Spain and of Austria. By 1964 tourism had become the largest single item in our external balance of pay- meats. By 1965 it earned Â£78.2m. This amount exceeded the value of the next most valuable, single emxport, live animals, by Â£1l9n., and was only Â£2.9m. below the value' 6f the total of all industrial exports. The importance which the Irish Government attaches to increasing revenue from external tourism is reflected in the Second Programme for Econo- mic Expansion and the greatly increased funds amounting to no less than Â£2.75m. annually allocated for tourist develop ment and promotion. Largest Market Britain is, of course, our largest market and the market which is on our door-step and most capable of the fullest and deepest penetration and expan- sion. Publicity campaigns by the Irish Tourist Board, and with other Irish tourist interests, and particularly joint campaigns with carriers such as Aer Lingus, BEA, British Rail and Coast Lines have been highly success- ful in penetrating it. These publicity campaigns In Britain have been backed by intensive field work by skilled, experienced staff operating in, and from, our London, Manchester Birming* ham and Olasgow offices. They have the fullest support from a highly developed marketing organisation embracing research and planning and publicity and sales. In fact of all national tourist boards in the world, the Irish Tourist Board, although the smallest In numbers, operates the most sophisticated marketing organisation of professionals.

   "text_content" : "In less than a decade, the old, pal brawny image of Irish exports tiv (butter by the firkin, beef on the sal hoof) has, gained a new social bre aplomb. Irish tweed in Harrods, pa4 Irish shoes in Montreal, Irish am chocolate in New York: the new the stance of Irish exports comes of deceptively near elegance. For foi much of this change, the Re. CI public must thank the amiable up adventurers of Coras Trachtala, abi its Export Board, for stepping so smoothly into the crowded room of international commerce. CTTI was established in 1952 to boost exports to the dollar cc area. When the dollar problem. min eased, its functions were nes extended to all markets except ott Britain. By 1958, with exports on still increasing, Britain had been *ut added to Coras Trachtala's beat of and an Export Promotion Act brn adopted it as a statutory body fth responsible to the Minister for fai Industry and Commerce. There W4 are six men on the Board of an CTT-five businessmen and a an civil servant-and a part-time F0 chairman. This year they will l spend a grant of Â£550,000. Their Fc brief is to promote, assist and Mi develop exports and to promote Fa and assist improvement in the Pa standard of design in Irish in- Pc dustry. N( its Setting the Pace t In a field as wide as they care an to make it, CTIT's activities form fai a pace-setting pattern of initia- tive for Irish manufacturers. pr They explore and investigate ha markets (most. recently, in ml Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong on and Australia), organise trade in' missions (Eastern Europe and ri other non-convertible-currency go areas promise openings in thi exchange and switch-trade busi- stc ness), feed back marketing in- Jo formation (on overseas distribu- Ft tion methods, sales procedures, Jo choice of agents), provide train- ii ing at home and abroad for Â£1 export sales executives, intro- su duce foreign buyers and show sel them around Ireland. i11 CTf grants to Irish manufac- ab turers help pay for market in- th vestigations and sales promo- in tion visits abroad, marketing re- ra search and consultancy. nartici. wl pation in frade fairs, co-opera- tive or group advertising and sales promotion, individual brand advertising, product and package design and the training and study tours of designers, and the translation and production of ackaging and propaganda for foreign-language markets. CTT loans help exporters to set up their own sales organisations abroad. Overseas Fairs So while, with one hand, Coras Trachtala may be lead- ing, Irish manufacturers into new export markets, it uses the other to help them stay there on their own. One of the quickest, most persuasive ways of showing how travel can broaden the market is to coax the manufacturers into trade fairs overseas. Last year, they were showing in the building and hardware fair in Olympia and in the London \" Fashion In Footwear\" fair; there were Irish stands in the ANUGA Food Fair in Cologne, the Munich Handicrafts and Trade Fair, the Pret-i-Porter fair in Paris and the National Fancy Food and Confections Show in New York. Back in Dublin itself, Coras Trachtala's third export fashion fair yielded on- the-spot orders totalling Â£l.lm. and business resulting from the fair is expected to reach Â£1.5m. The most arresting of CTT's promotional activities abroad have, perhaps, been its depart- ment-store promotions. The one in Harrods a year ago involved more than a hundred Irish manufacturers showing goods worth Â£450,000. More than 150 firms took part in three store promotions in the U.S. (in Jordan Marsh of Boston, Famous Barr of St. Louis, Joseph Home of Pittsbuirgh) with merchandise worth about Â£lm. By taking Irish products successfully into such affluent settings, CTT are making two important points in their beliefs about the Republic's 'exports: that Irish goods must compete in quality and individuality, rather than in price, especially when they involve a high labour d9 1.'- h h U content---an t& 1t ' ey MUSE compete with the design-con- sciousness of British and Scan- dinavian manufacturers. Design Project Just over five years ago, CTT invited a team of Scandinavian designers to report on the state of design in the Republic. The \"Scandinavian Report\" had much the same impact on public attention as had the Radcliffe Report on the City. The Irish were not altogether surprised to learn that their creative tradition had become literary and conver. sational, rather than visual, but a flicker of nationalism wondered If the Nords should really advise the Colts. But the virtual absence of native designers and the urgency of improvements in export design were persuasive. CTT, already subsidising and helping to manage the Irish Packaging Institute, now began establlshment of the Kilkenny Design Workshops. When it was opened officially last November, the Kilkenny project had five workshops in action, developing new products in such materials as wool, cotton and linen textiles, silver and non* precious metals, ceramics, wood and leather.

Â· riding discipline, it is chiefly that D of the Republic's Second Pro- 5 gramme for'Economic Expan- ing 1965, CTT introduced grants towards the cost of new adver- tising and sales promotion cam- .paigns in which Irish goods in Britain speak up for themselves.

   "text_content" : "The drive to develop a size- able export business in processed Irish foodstuffs is a race against time. It involves a radical change from a small highly protected industry at present supplying about half of the home market. This reorientation is urgent because of commitments in the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement to the principle of free trade, even though there has so far been no lifting of the restrictions on ih. ported foodstuffs. It is equally so in view of the revived expec- tation of Britain entering EEC and Ireland following in her wake. The time available to introduce new crops and new processes and to win customers may be short. The labour available in rural Ireland and willing to undertake the hand labour necessary for horticultural crops has been diminishing rapidly. If it goes it will be difficult to get back and one of the great opportuni- ties for raising the already sparse numbers and low incomes of the farm population may be lost. Critical Appraisal A Committee .on Industrial Organisation (CIO) was ap- pointed by the Jrish Govern- meat to make a critical appraisal of the measures tbat may have to be taken to adapt Irish industry to conditions aof tmore intensive competition at-hoime and abroad. Its report on frult-and vegetable processing (Deiember, 1964)hais proved to be ai!Vcry good'diahg nosis. It has so far stood the test of time. ht is a'useful-rifer- once point *from which to measure progress by Erin Foods. The report commented that .in the last analysis the success of the (Erin Foods) project would mainly depend on the- ability of the farmers to provide the neces- sary primary products at a cost which would enable the com- pany to compete with overseas competitors. Deficencies in either the quality or the volume 6* st I-. 'd st it ie ly c- C rn :e Ie Ie: w ofthe raw material could have n disastrous effects on the opera tions of the processing factories d and on the marketing operations, a Although Ireland's soil and \" climate are admirably suited to - several horticultural crops, the a volume of such production has been for historical reasons the lowest in Europe. Introducing a farmers to new crops, improving it methods of production, develop- ing and testing varieties, intro- ducing new machinery and estab- lishing the discipline of contract l growing have called for great efforts on many fronts. a- Progress has been rapid. The il quality of the fruit and vegetables o has shown consistent and rapid y improvement and is now good a by international standards. The 1. farmers are ready and willing to de lean and apply 'new techniques. oi The required acreages of all but . a few crops are freely available. e Continuous efforts to maintain r- or raise standards and efficiency o will, of course, be necessary but a the biggest hurdle has been n crossed. >f Pirogress in research and d development has also exceeded If expectations. Many improved s- and several new techniques have it been developed. New and im- i- proved products are coming s forward at a gratifying rate. n The same applies to farm o machinery. For example, a new vs ra iea w nd to he as he ng ag 'p ,bÂ· ict :at he lee id id be to ut re. in cy ut an Id ed ed ve nÂ· ng te. :w carrot harvester developed here has been adopted with enthusi- asm by Norfolk growers. Processing Side On the processing sing side, an annual budget of about Â£70,000 is available to train workers at all levels,, up to management This is reflected in a rapid rise in efficiency and, together with improvements in methods and equipment, reinforces gains in raw material quality. The creation from scratch of a new sales force and the estab- lishment of a new brand was described in the CIO report as \"a most difficult task.\" It has, indeed, proved to be so. Progress has been somewhat spasmodic. Nevertheless, the rate has been more than suffi- cient to meet the forecast in the report of Â£5.25m. exports in .1970-71. Exports in round figures have been:- Â£000 1961-62 .......... 43 1962-63 .......... 300 1963-64 .......... 500 1964-65 .......... 1,00 1965-66 .......... 1,200 In the first three months of the current financial year export sales are 83 per cent. up on last year. Sales in the profitable Irish market have exceeded expecta- tions, and have already passed the figure of Â£750,000 a year forecast for 1970-71. Two-thirds of this business has been won from imported brands. Enough has been done to prove the feasibility of develop- ing a big export trade in pro- cessed meat. It is probable that present limiting difficulties will soon be overcome. The most disappointing feature of the past two years has been delay in the development of associated processing plants and of the business of selling in export markets products made by other firms willing to accept Squality control by Brin Foods. r One rusoan for this is the credit squeeze, but another and more important is the pause in major capital investment pending con- sideration of a report from I the American consultants, ) A. D. Little, Inc., who have t made a complete appraisal of the business. Their report -is now s under consideration by the I Government which will have to I decide upon the total amount and the rate of further capital investment. CostlWy Operation t Using Irish resources in land, t climate, farm and factory labour Sand in professional talent. new t ground has been broken simul- I taneously in farm production, in processing, in research and a development and in the intro- I duction to the market of new products. Inevitably this is a I costly series of operations but in every aspect the cost of further advances will be less than that of the initial breakthrough. The rate and range of future develop- ment depends upon the rate and extent to which capital, now a scarce resource, can be invested. 9 Existing legislation authorises t Government investment of Â£3m. t in equity capital. All of this has already been provided. It also I authorises the Government to * provide or guarantee up to Â£5m. I of loan capital. So far only Â£lm. r of this has been sought and pro- i vided. It is estimated that from the present stage of development the introduction and establish- ment of each new product line with a turnover of about LÂ£m. t will call for the investment, I over a four-year period, of about Â£1.5m. excluding working capital. Â» Break-even point is estimated in I the fifth year and total recovery f of the capital by the fifteenth 1 year. ' Fast Pay-off This is not a fast rate of pay- off, but considering the increase of 1,500 per cent, over 10 years in.UK. Imports of frozen foods, the growing scarcity of labous for hand work on the land it other d6untries and the rapidl3 rising demand for convenience foods, it seems a sound long term investment. In the context of the Anglo Irish Trade Agreement, it is as investment that should be gooc for Britain. It should mean im ports paid for in sterling to the people who, in turn, spend or ritish goods more out of eact Â£1 they earn than any othel people in the world. But beyond all this it is a valuable social investment, pro serving and revitalising the social and economic life of Ireland's rural areas concerned and help. ina to chaback the flow of emira. t r f t f r r i f t I f I r AJFD. chick being checked after proceulu t",

   "article_dc_title" : "Keeping Textiles to the Forefront",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-26",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "An employment figure of 34,000 persons, producing goods to the value of Â£715m., of which 221 per cent. are exported, indicates the importanceo of the textile industry to the economy. The role of traditional mate- rials, such is Irish Linen, Donegal Tweed and Irish Poplin, is not physically large, but is important in keeping an Irish textile image to the forefront in international trade. The major portion of the Irish textile indus- try is a result of the policy of protection pursued by succes- sive Irish Governments, which created an industry geared to supply a large percentage of the domestic demand. The fact that the population of Ireland is approximately 2.75m. people has resulted in a large number of small units producing diverse ranges of merchandise. Policy Change However, some six years ago when the then Government de- cided to apply for membership of the European Economic Comn munity, the policy towards pro- tection was immediately altered and schemes for the dismantling of import tariffs were discussed between the Department for Industry and Commerce and the various industries concerned. Eventually the Government set up Committees for Industrial Organisation, whose principal function was to examine each particular industry and to report and make recommendations upon its prospects under freer trade. Several Committee for In- dustrial Organisation reports Miss Helena Routh, a Swedish-borm desIgner attached to the textile-weaving section of Kilkenny Design Workshops (Ireland's new centre of industrial design), prototypes a new design on her hand loom. Prototypes developed In the Workshop are available to manufacturers for volume production. were compiled and published upon various aspects of the tex- tile industry in Ireland. By and large, they recommended rationalisation of output and associations or mergers between the larger companies at different effi levels throughout the industry. as To a certain extent these mergers Th have taken place in the inter- wo vening period. The cotton spin- vei ning and weaving industry is tha negotiated a Free Trade Area between the two countries, which, in so far as the textile indushe wonted is concerned, meant immedate h dismantling of all tariffs on goods from Ireland to England, and the dismantling of Irish tariffs on goods from England to Ireland over a period of ten years. The most individumportant single item in the Free Trade Pact was the re-s. moval of the penal man-made fibres duties on exports to Great Britain, which took place on July 1 this year. Prior to this, Irish exports were virtually con- fined to merchandise produced from natural fibres only. At this two point it is desirable to look at textiles in two parts:- firstly, basic manufacture, that is, the production of yrned, fabric and cloth; and second, the apparel industry generally. In the more basic textiles it would seem that the fibre spinning industry for cotton, wool and man-made fibre mixture yarn is reasonably July eficient and is controlled largely ry. as a part of vertical integration. frs The production of woollen and er- worsted fabric is, however, still in- very much fragmented and it is is that industry, which is perhaps is that industry, which is perhaps All virtually completely controlled by Seafield Gentex Ltd. and Ash- .n tion Broi and Co. (Holdings) Ltd. scl T, e worted spinning industry is a controlled by the Sunbeam Wol cal sey Group, who are the largest be individual textileproducers in the _ country, having some 12 sub.- - sidiary and associate companies. When membership of the ce< European Economic Community Or was not possible, both the up British and-Irish Governments unl sec pa are cal be we pre lar cec Or up one of the oldest existing teitdle industries in the country, which requires re-equipment and into axtionon a very arg scale. Th production ofcotton'piece gpodi on the othr hand, it argely conceptrated in three or four factories using up-to-date machinery on a multi-shift basis. It should, iowevqr, be pointed out that the total size of Irish industry is small. For example, there are only approximately 130,000 spindles of spinning covering the worsted, woollen and cotton systems in the country, against an estimated 13m. spindles of cotton system spinning alone in the United Kingdom. The apparel side of textiles is undoubtedly where the largest scope for development and ex- pansion lies. Admittedly there are certain pockets, within this category, where competition will be severe and may result in, at the worst, the elimination of these products. It will only be the very large units who can hope to suc- ceed in this section of industry. On the other hand, the making- up trade, men's, women's and hildrels wWba, WOulid bwar to ser considerable Mscoe for urther expansion. This is a ranch of the industry where de- Iplay a la part and It ist ' Scourse, highly abour inten- Ive. The Prospect What are the future prospects As textiles in Ireland? The most ipparent disadvantages lie in Ize; in lack of tradition; in the need to import all raw materials ind in geographical location. On the other hand, the industry both in buildings and machinery is relatively new, there is a plen- tiful supply of really good labour and the proven ability of management to export a useful percentage of the total produc- tion. Satisfactory perimeter protec- tion against low cost imports and dumping is to be provided under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and there is every reason to assume that the Irish textile industry will have good prospects for further de- velopment.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "We now know that as fai back as 1963 Mr. Lemass approached Mr. Macmillan and suggested the formation of a Free Trade Area betweer Ireland and the U.K. The negotiations apparently nevei got of the ground. The projeci was reopened with Mr. Wilsor and after nine months of discus sions between officials of the twc Governments and two meeting, on Ministerial level agreementi for the establishment of a Free Trade Area between the two countries were signed on December 14, 1965. Why? The British Govern- ment could answer this question very easily. In return for direct Irish participation in some British agricultural subsidies the agreements would result in completely free access for British industrial exports into the Republic subject to certain limited exceptions. The answers given by the Irish Government were more complex. British Market Under the existing Trade Agreements between the two countries the vast majority of Irish industrialists, while ade- quately protected against British competition, enjoyed free entry into the British market. The world (and in particular Europe) is, it was said, moving towards freer trade; Irish industry must prepare itself for the full blast of competition when Ireland becomes a member of the European Economic Com- munity; conditions of free trade between this country and the 1 United Kingdom would have, as one Minister put it, a \"tuning. up\" effect on the economy; in i short, free trade with the United Kingdom would be a useful proe. paration for free trade with Europe, Thus, acceptance of this Treaty (like another famous Treaty between the two countries) was urged on the ground that it could be regarded as a stepping-stone to future de. velopments for this country- this time, entry into the EEC. The agreements came under very careful scrutiny and con* siderable criticism in the debates in the Dall. The possible ad. verse effects on the industrial sector of the economy with the consequent danger to employ. ment were stressed and it was suggested that the losses on the industrial swings would not be adequately compensated for by the sug sted gains on the agri. culturai roundabout., It was argued that the agreements were In fact unbalanced and would enefit British, at the expense of Irish, interests, And the effect of the agreements on Irish rela. tions with Europe and their possible political consequences were seriously examined, Separate Treatment ? Ireland, It will be recalled, made no move to join the Buro* pean onomic Com unity until aelecion to a for mbr had been aken by t Brith Government, but i nerAl de a'ulle's veto of the Britis app liation had the effect of lusiend n the Irish applica- tion, Could nothinj have done about Il since 93A was i a pqrate Irish initiative in these t thre years poble Could 0 have been opened w te Community whCh, would haeresulted In an agree. ment would not save obliged Ireland to raise the Cmmon Iret teri against Such exceptional treatment, it was pointed out, had been accorded to West Germany in the case of imports from East Germany, and the French, Italians and Dutch had obtained similar concessions in respect of imports from certain ex-colonial territories. Furthermore, the Austrian Government has been negotiating membership of the EEC on the basis that the ex. ternal tariff would not apply to trade from Eastern Europe. Was an analogous arrangement for Ireland not possible? Points of View The idea that a worthwhile agreement with the EEC could have been concluded which would not interfere with Ireland's traditional trading links with the United Kingdom was dismissed by the Taolseach as \" nave \" and \"foolish.\" The Opposition countered by point. ing out that no attempt had been made; that no serious diplomatic offensive had been mounted In Europe; that, in marked contrast to the Danish Foreign Minister (who travels to Brussels every couple of months), the Irish Minister for External Affairs had only once visited the Comrn mission, and that in the past three years in his opening speeches to the Dail on hil de. partment's estimate he had only devoted 58 words to European AIffairs, The two positions on this con- troversy were summarised when Mr. Cosgrave, the Leader of the Opposition, told the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe that he did not regard the road through London as the quickest way to Brussels, and by Mr. Lemass who answered by expressing the opinion that there were, at the present time, no ro&ds to Brussels. r ornot an independent SInitiative was possible and, If possible, would have been Is usful will now remain one of the might hav-beens of history, Incapable of proof one way or the other. But what of the future? Impl icit in the Anloirlsh Treaty s the belief by the Irish Governme t that Ireland annot go into urope without the United Knindom, Johnl Null and Cthisen Ni a slahain are now hand in and together at the ates of rope. And quite explolity the overnment has stated its belief (in the White Paper publishec with the agreements) that mem bership of the EEC could be achieved by 1970 \"and that we would have to accept the ful obligations of membershipwithit a relatively short period aftel entry to the community.\" 1970 Entry? How realistic is the assump tion that we will be members bj 1970? When entry was las attempted no serious negotiation on the Irish application won even commenced until the Britisl negotiations were well advanced Presumably, a similar time-table will be adopted in the event of i fresh start being made with th4 British application. Again, hou it realistic is the assumption tha in Ireland will be accepted as a ful in member? It is known that then st are serious doubts in the Com h, munity concerning Ireland'i :d ability to accept the obligationi of of full membership and if we fel al to be treated as a country (to usi ie the current euphemistic phrase in \"in the course of economi< ie development\" then full mom x. bership could be long delayec to and full participation in the com e. mon agricultural policy possibl at postponed. Vital Questions The answers to these question lie are vital to Ireland's wholi Id economic and political develop Yh ment. Although Irish Minister th may travel to Brussels for talk 1i with the Commission, anm m although Ministers may wari ih the country to be prepared so ie membership of the Community it- there It, In fact, now little tha in we can do but stand and wal ic until Mr. Wilson knocks aga4i In on the door of Europe.
