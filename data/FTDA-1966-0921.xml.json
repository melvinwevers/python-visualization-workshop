   "article_dc_title" : "No Freeze on Clyde Deal",
   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staf The Clyde shipyarde' productivity agreement Is to go through despite the freeze. Mr. Ray Gunter. Minister of Labour, said yesterday that the agreement was not covered by the freeze because a \"substantial proportion\" of the 3,300 boilermakers involved had received pay increases before the fromeeze came into effect on July 20. His ruling came in identical letters to the Clyde Ship- builders' Association and Mr. Dan McGarvey, president of the Boilermakers' Amalgamation. It was emphasised in the letter that the productivity deal was not being excluded from the freeze because it \"contained highly desirable features which it was the policy of the Govern- ment to encourage.\" The sole consideration had been date of implementition. It was clear last night that opponents of the wage freeze-and particularly those whose produc- tivity deals had been vetoed-will now campaign even harder against the Government. Commonsense, says Cousins Mr. Frank Cousins, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, com- mented that he was delighted by this \" return to commonsense. He pointed out that there were other productivity agreements which could make an equal con- tribution to economic progress. A spokesman for British Oxygen said: \" Any change in the Govern- ment's attitude to genuine produc- tivity agreements is likely to receive our support.\" BOC and the TGWU are discussing whether they are able to amend a major productivit deal to bring it into line with Government guidance, Mr. Edward Heath, Leader of the Qpposlion, also aemphasisd the productivity aspect in a s ment from Conservative Central Office. He welcomed the deision but said it had been taken for the wrong reasons. The agreement had only been implemented for a small proportion of the workers before July 20. \"The real reason why this agree. ment ought to be exempted is that it is jiutifable in its own right.\" he said. \"The country benefits from increased productivity at the same time as the men get the rewards in increased wages. The Government should now accept this basic fact and exempt those other genuine productivity agree- ments which, at the moment, they are so stupidly trying to ban.\" The Clyde deal, concluded on July, gives flexibility of labour wthn the five sections of the Boilermakers' Amalgamation in six yards in the upper reaches of the Clyde. Three wage increases of 4d an hour are to be paid in return- one when 'the agreement is accepted at individual yards, the next when it comes into effect, and the final payment when the agree- ment is in full operation. So far these payments have been made only in one smaller yard- that of Charles Connell and Co. However, subsidiary agreements, later incorporated in the. main \" package,\" had been negotiated in the two biggest yards, John Brown and Co., and Alexander Stephen and Sons. Payments of 6d and 7d an hour are being made. \"Over 50% of Men in Three Yards\" Mr. William Dawson, secraeary of the CSA, said that the men in the three yards concerned made up \"more than 50 per cent.\" of those covered by the full agreement. \"N tra)ly we are delIghted at bhiirifoiuftbae decision. We are meeitng the Boilermaker' Amalga tion to-morrow to tie up odds and ends.\" A spokesman for the Amalga- mation said it was a wonderful decision for all concerned in the shipbuilding industry. The three other yards involved in the agreement are Yarrow and Co., Warclay Curie, and Scott and Sons (Bowling).",

   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspondent The Clyde productivity decision has caused surprise at Westminster. First, it runs completely contrary to reports of thei Government's attitude, based on usually reliable Whitehall sources, after last Fri. day's Cabinet meeting. Second, and more important, it was taked against the original advice of Mr. Stewart, the Mmnister for Economic Affairs, who had maintained that to exempt even one productivity agreement from the \" total\" freeze -for whatever reason-might create a damaging precedent. What actual happened behind the scenes wai that at a Ministerial meeting over a week ago, though Mr. Ounter, Minister of Labour, strongly argued that to stop the Editorial comi pact now would create severe anomalies among the workers covered by (t. Mr. Stewart's view prevailed. On Friday. just before the crucial Cabinet meeting at which this view was reversed, there was another meeting of Ministers, in cluding the Prime Minister, Mr, stewart, Mr. Callaghan, Mr. Ounter and Mr. Jay. President of the Board of Trade. It is understood that at this meet- ing. Mr. Jay proposed that the agreement should. after all.. be exempted from the freeze. He was supported by Mr. Ounter and other Ministers. and at the follow. ing Cabinet the final decliion was taken. \"meut Pap 12",

Mr. Ian Smith quietly slipped into Government House here this afternoon and spent two hours with the Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Herbert Bowden, and the Attorney-General, Sir Elwyn Jones, It was the first personal contact between Mr. Smith and a British Minister since before UDI was declared at thebeginning of November last year. Mr. Smith was accompanied by his Minister of Justice, Mr. Lardner-Burke, and the officials who represented Rhodesia at the \" talks about talks.\" It is believed that the Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs. whs also nresent TIooDS, was also present. It is generally thought to be significant that Mr. Smith was pre- pared personally to go to the British Ministers in Government House. where Sir Humphrey Gibbs has been ignored by the Rhodesian regime since shortly after UDI. But. apart from this concession by Mr. Smith to commonsense. both sides are carefully maintainifn their separate constitutional po tiohs. Statements A statement issued from the British Mission said \"discussions took place this afternoon between the Commonwealth Secretary and his party and Mr. Smith end his party.\" The Rhodesian statement, in turn, read: \"Discussions took place this afternoon between Mr. Herbert Bowden and his party and the Rhodesian Prime Minister and his party.\" The discussions will presumably all be conducted in this farcical-if inevitable-way. It may be assumed that to-day's discussions followed the lines laid down in the communiqu6 of the Commonwealth Conference. Mr. Bowden will have told Mr. Smith of the British proposals to resolve the crisis and of Britain's intention to communicate these intentions \"through the Governor to all sec- tions of opinion in Rhodesia\" and to tell Mr. Smith what Britain proposes to do if the \"initial and indispensable steps\" are not taken to end the rebelion. The British Ministers consider that the critical point is whether or not Mr. Smith will obstruct theem Ifrea uiq C , withi \"all seotoi:r , pibion,\" whlio must by any interpretation incldde the African edes now in restric. tion. The willngness of the Rhodesian Governmeet on this point-and it must have been raised to-day-will clearly deter- mine the length of Mr. Bowden's visit. First Stage A positive answer from Mr. Smith is the prerequisite to the cona tinuation of the talks and thus, to any hope of success. The Ministers are understood to be thinking of the first two or three days as the first stage of discussions: they apparently believe that during this first stage it will be possible to decide whether or not there is any Coninued on Page 20",

Demand for the 6 per cent. Funding \"tap\" enabled the Government broker to raise his selling price by * to 844. Unchanged for most of the day, the share-index ended 0.3 up at 306.9. Rank The Rank report pinpoints with some accuracy the failures last rear, First there were the' hotel osses, up to Â£625,000 and by the sound of it likely to persist in good measure until 1969-70. Then the manufacturing division went further into the red, more due to bad luck than to bad management, except in electronics. If one throws in the gloomy statistics that SET will cost the group Â£lm. in a full year and that the elimina- tion of investment allowances robs earnings of some IlY\\ points, the chairman's caution about prospects is understandable. However, despite a warning that capital expenditure has had to be pruned to prevent a further capital raising venture-which with net short-term borrowings and loans of Â£69.8m. against stockholders assets of Â£77.1m. would suggest a rights issue-higher profits are forecast this year. Once again Rank-Xerox is going to do the trick. The points about R-X are that 70 per cent. of its turnover is overseas. and it is forecasting that 32,000 machines will be placed this year against a grand total of 58,000 installations by the end of 1965-66. If revenue moves up in step and margins remain unchanged, then Rank-Xerox's pre-tax profits would rise to Â£23.1m. Even after a 45 per cent. tax charge, full conver- sion and no more of an increase in the datum line than last year, this would still produce earnings of 2.06 shillings per Rank share. At 27s 6d the \"A\" are selling at 13.3 times their share of R-X earn- ings, with the rest thrown in (or nothing. On this valuation Rank can take Its time putting the rest .of the bits and pieces in order,, See also Page 15 C. A. Parsons C. A. Parsons' trading profits for the first half are up from Â£491,000 to Â£707,000, thanks very largely to the capacity it bought from GEC, but pre-tax profits are down from Â£581,000 to Â£561,000. The fly in the ointment is a jump in interest charges-a large chunk of current work in progress is for ex- port which Parsons has to finance itself. For the year, therefore, completions could rise from 1.6m. to 2m. kW, but pre-tax profits may not be much different from last year's Â£2.38m. This could give earnings after a full tax charge of 12.7 compared with the 13% per cent, dividend, though in fact Parsons' tax charge should be sub-normal again. The 6% per cent, yield at 421 3d is rightly not expecting much in the short term. The p/e ratio, on the other hand, of between 12-16% times, depending on the tax charge, is looking for growth. It is true, for a few years at least, Parsons should have plenty to offer. Only the first of the four Ferrybridge 500 MW sets -is anywhere near commissioning and there are 25 more sets to come of this size, plus four at 350 MW and two nuclear 660 MW sets. But the rate of scheduled commission- ing tails off rapidly after the 1969 peak, and future CEGB ordering is in some doubt. This leaves Parsons with its other U.K. com- mercial work and exports to plug the gap. The trouble is on present form this side will boost work in progress faster than it does profits. See also Page 15 Amalgamated Dental The important point in the Amalgamated Dental interim state- ment is that the capital reconstruc- tion is coming next month.

Apart from eliminating the Preference with the proceeds of the sale of the shares in Dentists' Supply, Amalgamated Dental seems likely to make an issue of loan stock to shareholders while endeavouring to keep the dividend' intact at 16 per cent. A distribu- tion of 10s nominal of 8 per cent loan stock for each Ordinary share would imply an effective prospec- tive yield of 7.3 per cent. and a p/e ratio of 8.3 times. Neither is startling. On the other hand if 15s were handed out the yield would improve to 8.2 per cent. and the p/e to 7% per cent.; 20s naturally would be a shareholders' dream raising the yield to 9.4 per cent and reducing the pie to 7.1 times. Of course Amalgamated Dental will be concerned over the dose of gearing it can apply to its assets and the limitations a loan stock issue will place on further borrowings. On the other hand the shares have never sold on their p/e ratio but on yield.

   "text_content" : "By Our Commoditi6e Stab SULPHUR production is heading for a new peak this year, although the world sulphur sbhortage will probably not be finally solved until around 1968. New capacity is being brought on stream in several parts of the world in answer to the con- tinuing high level of prices. How- ever, in the first half of 1966 export deliveries to international markets by the four principal suppliers-Mexico, France, Canada and the U.S.-were 400.000 tons lower. The encouraging price level has prompted a round of new invest- ment. Occidental Petroleum and Allied Chemical are to construct a S19m. sulphur recovery plant in Saudi Arabia, which will produce 250.000 tons a year by 1968. It is expected that by 1970 Canadian production will have doubled last year's total of 2.2m. tons. Gas By-product In both these cases expansion will come as a by-product of the purification of \"sour \" natural gas, says the latest edition of the journal Sulphur. In addition, the U.S. frascb (sulphur extraction in liquid form using high pressure steam) sulphur industry has entered a new expansion phase. Freeport Sulphur Company, the world's largest brimstone pro- ducer, will bring a new plant on- stream in 1968 with a capacity of 500.000 tons. Texas Gulf Sulphur Company is also to step up output. The world demand for sulphur is a growing one, associated with the growth of the cr\"ei Aeal nmdadt fibres, iron aind steel, fertiliser plastic, packaing and per indus trie. Sulphuric acid, t intennr diate product; i one of industry's most widuyh ed chemicals, and the demand for it is settling down to an annual srowth rate stimated at around 10-13 per cent. Despite the increased level of in. vestment In productive capacity, there Is for the time beino a shortage; prices have risen by 44 per cent. since the end of 1964, and sa result the prices of -lutbsee troducts such as fertisers have had to follow suit. U.K. Imports Mexican exports are of particular relevance to the British chemical in. dustry, which receives about one-third to one-half of its requirements of ele. mental sulphur from that source. The remainder comes mainly from Prance and the U.S., though the proportions from each vary from year to year. The U.K.'s current rate of imports of sulphuric acid is likely to continue into next year. Meanwhile, the pos- tion in the UX. is not so serious as had at one time been feared, thanks to a fall off in the growth of fertilier consumption from predicted levels.",

Of this year's crop, wineries and other processors will probably take about 35,000 tons with the rest being exported or sold fresh in Canada. There are some 1,700 grape growers in the province, half of whom grow under contract to wineries and processors. The influx of Europeans into Canada during the last few years has sharply increased wine con- sumption. According to the Cana- dian Wine Institute, overall wine sales in Canada amounted to 7,894,000 gallons at the last count, a rise of 65 per cent. on the 4.765.000 gallons sold ten years earlier. While Concord is the main type of Brape grown in Ontario. growers are turning to French hybrid and other new varieties in response to the rising demand for grapes for table. wines. This year French hybrid TORONTO, Sept. 20. varieties occupy about 18 per cent. of the province s 22,000 acres of vine- yards, according to the Ontario De- partment of Agriculture. This compares with about 7 per cent. in 1961 and 4 per cent. 10 years ago. The switch from Concords to the more recently developed wine grapes might have been quicker were It not for the security grape growers gt .from Concords, industry men say. Concords can be used for wine, grape uice and Jam or sold in the fresh fruit market. Many of the new varities are good only for wine and some growers fear they could suffer if tastes in wine change.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commnodtie Editor I I\"'aE CHANCIALILOR of the to be aet with sympathy and *on- sideration for their special rob Slems.\" was eta by Mr. of Newport. Shropshire. He add that the Government was stopping up food productiao to save im- within the general credit policy the banks shoyldiv proper tion to th, ture. He stressed that the Govern- ment recognised that credit was an essential part of the physical and financial resources that the industry needed for the 4ncrease of output under the selective expansion pro- gramme, but it also meant that bank lending to agriculture must be in step with the general measures that the Chancellor had had to take to regulate the supply of credit. \"Fair Share\" As you well know, said Mr. Peart, new bank lending to all sec- tors of the economy was severely restricted as a matter of Govern- ment policy. \" In practipe the banks have been left free to decide their lending policy in the light of the broad guidance that the Chancellor has given and in accordance with the norinal criteria of creditworthi- ness. Within these limits the Chan- cellor expects that the banks will ensure that farmers get their fair share of the credit that is avail- able.\" Mr. Peart went on to refer to the three principal types of credit that farmers and growers need, and stated: \" What I am now going to say has the full authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer behind it.\" Dealing first with seasonal credit, Mr. Peart pointed out: \"There never has been, and there is not now, any restriction on the supply of necessary seasonal credit whether directly to. farmers and growers, or indirectly for the bene- fit of agriculture and horticulture, to those like agricultural merchants or live-stock dealers. It has been made quite clear to the banks that their total ceiling on credit can be exceeded in the short term to cover seasonal credit required, for example, during the period before a crop or before stock are sold. \"The banks fully understand this position, and should be pre- pared to meet fully normal sea- sonal requirements of this kind. SeAonal credit can be got, and farmers and growers should have no hesitation in asking the banks for it. Then there .wap *longer-term !Â· I t 'iÂ· I I i.: t I Scredit fquled so vAious pur- '- Cir P r Os oHthing the t\"uld lot 4itne. Retrat a'1to be arn's during this I dIflt pid. But farmer have got the Agricultural Mort. gage Corporation, to whom they t t Mr. P. Pe ri can turn for this purpose, and the AMC have just rone to the market for more capital.\" This left the question of medium-term credit for productive investment in agriculture. Finance was needed to see ant animal through to the market in maybe one or two years. or even longer. \"The banks are fully aware of this problem, and they are prepared to consider sympathetically requests for credit for this purpose from fully credit-worthy borrowers. \" As regards medium-term credit for other essential purposes, even here the banks will in many cases be prepared to consider requests, provided the period involved is not too long.\" \"Early Days\" On the subject of the selective expansion programme (which covers the years up to 1970) Mr. Peart said it was a long-term pro- gramme and agriculture. of course. was a long-term business. \" We are still in the early days. But since the base year for the plan-.-which was 1964-agricultural production has continued to expand broadly as we had hoped. During the 1964-65 farm year tbe net output of agricul- ture for the U.K. as a whole rose by 7 per cent. However, this excep- tionally high rate of expansion was partly due to good weather. \" We estimate that in the follow- ing year net output rose by a further 2 per cent.-the weather was not so good-so that so far the annual rate of increase has been about 4%/s per cent. This is some- what larger than we envisaged in the plan. Mr. Peart declared that the most effective use of manpower was essential for our national pros- perity Turning to productivity, Mr. Peart said it was the Government's intention to create the conditions in which full-time commercial farmers could use a reasonable p pf.theif Orising productjvity .tp ItÂ· 'I w at b rr r- er aapu eeasary faMhsr in.,, vestment, and to increase their net incomes and so their standard of livin&, although this would naturally need to be carried out within the principles of the Government's prices and incomes policy. Mr. eart said: \"In our talks with the farmers' unions we have agreed on the method to be used for calculating in terms of peace per gallon how far the pool price mr ilk would be diluted by a given expansion of the dairy herd tb produce more beef, and this figure will be included in the Annual Review statistical data.\" Hill farmers bad been baving a difficult time in recent weeks when prices in the store markets, both for sheep and store cattle. had fallen considerably. But he hoped that what he had said about credit, both for seasonal purposes and for the buying of stock, would restore confidence. The production of poultry meat and eggs had kept pace with demand Pig Expansion The position on pig ,was. bow- ever, not so satisfactory. The total Pig-breeding herd had fallen over the last two years, and the latest figures showed oad immediate prospect of this trend being reversed. Mr. Peart announced that \"It is the Government's intention at the next Annual Review to raise the level of the middle band in the flexible guarantee arrangement for pigs by 400.000 without prejudice to further examination of the cir- cumstances at the time of the next annual review and to any decision that may then be taken on price.\" Under the, subsidy system, farmers, at present get a basic guaranteed price for pigs of 45s 3d a score. This only applies if between 12.4m. and 13.2m. pigs a year are marketed, the \"middle and.\" If fewer were marketed. the price would rise by 9d a score, and if the number were exceeded the price would fall by 9d a score. Yesterday's change announced by the Minister means that an extra 400.000 pigs can be marketed with- out farmers incurring a drop of 9d. a score in the guaranteed price, giving room for expansion of about Im. pigs a year. Mr. Peanr's statement on the Government's . agricultural credit policy should restore confidence in the markets. said Mr. G. T. Williams. president of the Natiolal Faribrs' Union. yesterday. \"The unions welcome the Govern- ment's reiteration of the importance of argiculture's role in import-saving and the realistic appraisal by the Minister of Agriculture of the in- dustry's contribution to the national economy. \" The Government has again made k clear that farmers and growers will need both the physical and financial resources if they are to do the job.\" Editorial comment Page 12"

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent NEW YORK, Sept. 20. ATTORNEY GENERAL Mr. Katzenbach told the meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board that inflation is playing a role in the U.S. Government's fight of mergers it considers anti- competitive. He said a concentrated market was not \" the major factor\" re- sponsible for inflation in the economy, but it played \" a signifi- cant\" role that \" promises to be- come increasingly important.\" He explained that concentrated indus- tries can set prices independent of market factors and thus make in- flation more difficult to control Mr. Katzenbach said concentration makes it easier for unions to pressure companies into giving uneconomic wage increases, since the companies, because of their position, can pass the added cost on to the consumer. \"And these wage increases have a broader effect because of the pressures they create for the leaders of other unions in non-concentrated industries to seek parallel gains.\" The position of the British Govern. ment on mergers and takeovers was outlined to the Board by Sir Thomas B. Robson, past-President of the institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Sir Thomas said: \" British Govern. ment policy aims at the promotion of business growth through mergers, which are thought to be in the pub- lic interest and the prevention of mergers only where they are deemed to be contrary to it.\"",

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff WASHIWTNCTN Rnt M)- COMMUNICATION Satellite Corporation's plans for an aero- nautical satellite linking ground control with aircraft flying across the Atlantic have been delayed by at least one year. Comsat origin- ally hoped that the satellite would be operational in the autumn of next year: now its target date is late in 1968. This is because Comsat and the Federal Aviation Agency agreed that a proposal submitted by Com- sat in March-for a satellite which would be provided by Hughes Aircraft Corporation-was both too expensive and technically inadequate. Comsat has now in- vited tenders for a new system, and expects to return to the FAA with a fresh proposal early next year. The company indicates that the aeronautical satellite will be launched by a long-tank Delta booster, which will permit a heavier and technically superior satellite than that of the original specifications. This should allow for as many as eight simplex voice channels, compared with the origi- nal design for two two-way channels. Comsat proposes that the system should use two ground stations- one at Andover, Maine, which Comsat uses at present for its Early Bird operations, and a new ground station which would be uilt in the British Isles-at a site as yet unnamed. The scheme has the strong sup- port of the FAA and of U.S. air- lines on international routes. Mr. Archie League, director of air WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. traffic service of the FAA, said here that there was \"an urgent need for more reliable, static-free communications between ground stations and aircraft in oyer-ocean fliht.\" Whereas 224 aircraft flew dally across the North Atlantic during the summer months, by 1975 this total would probably exceed 400. The airlines agree with the FAA that initial satellite communica- tions should be over VHF, rather than UHF, bands, and in Novem- ber-at a meeting of members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation-they will urge that two 200-kilocycles-wide segments in the existing VHF band. separated by seven megacycles, be made available for satellite com- munication from mid-1968. The cost of the scheme is far from definite. Last December Comsat told the FAA a two- channel satellite serving the Atlantic would cost S5.2m., that two satellites serving both the Atlantic and Pacific areas would cost $8.6m. and that a world-wide operation would cost $12m. However, the Hughes proposal was costlier than this, and it seems probable that tenders submitted in the comiing months will similarly be more expensive. Nor has any agreement been reached on how the cost of the programme should be shared between the Govern ment, U.S. airlines and foreige airlines.",

Staf REPRESENTATIVB Adam Clay- ton Powell (Democrat, Hartn), one of the very few negroet to rise tp prominence in Washijgton, may well be stripped of his powers this week. The future of the Adniniistration's SI,750m. \"War on Poverty\" Bill will largely tunge on the result of this Con- gressional power struggle. For the past five years, Mr. Powell has been chairman of the house Education and Labour Com- mittee. Without doubt he has been an effective chairman-54 im- portant pieces of legislation have successfully passed through his committee, including major breakthroughs in social welfare legislation. Away from the House floor Mr. PowelPs behaviour has been, to put it politely, unconven- tional. Nevertheless his fellow committee members have shied away from censuring him because in effect Congress itself would be brought into disrespect. This week. however, Mr. Powell's charmed life faces its stiffest tests. To-morrow morning he faces a jury trial in the New York Supreme Court to determine the wilfulness of his contempt of court in refusing to pay libel judgements which now total 5162.000. More important on Thurs- day some Democrat members of his committee will attempt to divest him of his powers as chairman. These would be handed over to six sub. committee chairmen, while Mr. Powell would be the titular, but powerless, chairman. Thirdly it became known to-day that the House Administration com- mittee had tentatively decided to ex- amine Mr. Powell's handling of the finances of his own office and those of his committee.

However, Mr. Powell's continued absences and his feud with House Rules Committee (which has WASHINUTUN, WepI. A. to clear legislation for floor discur n has layed action for months. The leader of the anti-Powell re- volt, Representative Sam Gibbons (Democrat.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent AFTER a long deadlock, virtual agreement has been reached on the expansion of the International Monetary Fund's scheme for com- pensating primary producing countries for fluctuations in export earnings. This Compensatory Financing facility, introduced in 1963, allows a developing country which can show that its export earnings have fallen below a \" trend\" level determined by the Fund to draw up to 25 per cent. of its Fund quota even if it has already drawn up to the limit of its normal credit. It was suggested at the time of the last IMF annual meeting that these compensatory drawing rights should be extended to 50 per cent. of a country's quota. This was fairly quickly agreed in principle in the Fund Board (partly because the facility has been so seldom used). But an interminable and charac- teristic wrangle has ensued over the terms under which the country using the scheme should be re- quired to pay its debt The less-developed countries have been anxious to ensure that the debtor should be able to re- finance his debt after the normal three to five-year Fund repayment period. They therefore adopted a proposal that repayment should be made in five equal annual instal- ments but that half the amount of these repayments should be counted as shortfalls below the WASHINGTON, Sept 20. \"trend\" when computing further compensatory drawing rights. At the other extreme, the Euro- pean Economic Community mem- bers were in favour of a scheme which stuck rigidly to the three to five-year repayment period and under which. moreover. countries would be required to repay half their excess export earnings each year if and when these excesses were achieved. In the end, by a compromise which is still much criticised by the developing countries, it was agreed that the normal three to five-year rule would'be adhered to but that the obligation to repay half the excess export earnings would be moral and not legally binding.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Record Spending on Expansion of the Mining Industry",
   "text_content" : "By a Special Correspondent In Toronto By a Special Correspondent In Toronto The key to the growth and development of the Canadian mining industry Is the un- precedented level of capital investment being made these days by the industry. Total amounts of money involved are considered unprecedented In a field of business where the spectacular is commonplace. Official figures tell only a small part of the story. But they are impressive. Govern- ment surveys indicate that this year the Canadian mining industry will spend some $635 minon on plant and equip- ment. Thu total spresents an increase of ovewr 40 per cent from the previous year. A jump of this size is straining the ability of the nation to provide the manpower and the machinery. Ample capital appears to beavailable, largely generated by the companies themselves. FutW projeta The developments which con- tribute to that $635 million total (of which half is for machinery), in many canes will run into futws years. The figures, of course, do not take this Into consideration. Large new Canadian mining develop. ments require about three years from the financing and the firm decision to get into production to the stage where minerals start flowing to market. Thus a major portion of this year's expenditures is on projects looking ahead to future years, Rt is often the oan in natural resource development that axpeaditue are concen- trated in on area on one particular product. The strength of develop- ments In Canadian mining in recent years has been their diverslty.Theoountry is rapidly becoming the dominant producer of potash, It now is the second largest producer of molybdenum, the largest uingle source of columbium. Only a handful of years ago, these minerals were not extracted In Canada. There are, of course, the mining fields which have made Canada famous around the world as a source of supply of vital industrial raw materials. The major uranium camp at Elliot Lake in Ontario hasadded otherexotic minerals to its production lines. And there is considerqble excite- ment about uranium's pro- spects with the expansion of nuclear .power programmes, particularly In Europe, Canada has the uranium ore reserves, about one-third of the known western world's supplies. There have been significant breakwhroghsi Iron develop. ment, puouRLin projeot wher the bullt of production is scheduled for Canadian steel mills. A combination of increased availability of natural as and steel mill technology laoresiag the use of iron pellets have made economic long-known lower- grade iron deposits, especially In Ontario. Similarly, im- proved technology accounts for a good part of the major mining projects in copper and molybdenum in British Columbia. Invariably, these are large open-cast operations using what is considered very low-grade ore. And in the more conventional Canadian underground operations, in- creased mechanisation is the solution being tried to vexing problems In obtaining suitable staff. World-wide As Canadian mining spread its wings into a lengthening list of products, It has had to develop and find more sophis- ticated techniques and equip- ment for its separation plants. Inevitably the Canadian mining Industry actively seeks around the world new tech- niques, machinery and other equipment, as well as develop. ing techniques of its own., The reason for this world-wide orientation is simple. Markets are world-wide. You cannot appreciate the changes in Canada without taking a look for yourself. This Is no problem, AIH CANADA (with mOAC) runs daily flights from London to Montreal and Toronto. To gt further west, take the Air Canada Western Arrow sor- vice direct to Vancouver, Winnipeg, Calgary or Bdmon- ton. Once you're In Canada, Ajr Canada can put you down in more than 3S inpo. ant eities, And when the time comes to move in on this profitable new market, the daily Ali CANADA/NOAC freight service to all Canada will speed your deliveries."

   "text_content" : "From Our U.S. Staff ON TWO separate occasions to-day President Johnson urged speedy action by Congress on eight outstanding Appropriations Bills still pending. Until it knew what Federal spending was going to be the Administration could make no relevant fiscal decisions, the Presi- dent pointed out. \"No one can put his finger within $2,000m. of what ultimate Appropriations totals will be,\" the President remarked. He said Budget Bureau Director, Mr. Charles Schultze. estimated that it would be anywhere \"between 2,000m.-8,000m. over our budget re- quest of last January.\" While Repre- sentative Charles Mahon, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, was saying it would \"run to a few hundred million.\" While hoping Congressman Mahon WASHINGTON, Sept. 20. would'be closer to the final figure the President insisted be wanted to make sure the Government was \" taking in as much and more than we are going to spend \"-another hint that the Administration was actively consider. ing a tax increase. The President also announced to-day the Govern- ment planned to sell Americans a new kind of saving certificate \"with an appropriate rate of interest.\" These new savings bonds will be unveiled in November or December and will go on sale early next year. Neither the President nor Treasury Secretary, Mr. Henry Fowler, would indicate this afternoon what rate of interest the new bonds would carry. Mr. Fowler said they would be a \"more attrac- tive product line\" and would carry \"a much higher rate of interest than the 4.15 per cent. which savings bonds now yield if held to their seven-year maturity. In the recent spiralling of interest rates U.S. savings bonds have hardly been competitive."

FC.A., which has been circulated with the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March. 1966: Last year I referred to the un- certainty facing the immediate future of the building and allied trades in the United Kingdom, and unfortunately my fears proved to have been well grounded, as there was a marked down-turn in activity in the last half of the financial year. Although the Group net profits before taxation show an actual increase of Â£284.000 over those for the previous year, they include a full year's contribution from Inns & Co. Ltd., who joined the Redland Group during the vear. and there was an overall re- duction of some 17\\% in the profits derived from the rest of the Group's interests. This is a con- siderably greater reduction than can be attributed to the weather in the last six months of the financial year, and is the direct consequence of the effect of Government policy on the building and construction industry. The Group profit for the year amounted to Â£5,425,121 before tax, to which our overseas interests contributed Â£1,435,120. We recom- mend a Final Ordinary Dividend of 8'%. which accords with the forecast made in December last of a total dividend for the year of 18/% less tax. Roofing Tiles: This Division did well to maintain its turnover in a period when starts on the con- struction of new houses fell by 10%' compared with the previous year and competition intensified. There was a comparatively small reduction in the total net profit of the Division. Construction of the new tile i works at Burlescombe in Devon is now nearing completion and plans. are also well advanced for the building of two more roofing tile works in . other parts of the country. Bricks: Last year I said that it was anticipated that as soon as the then financial stringency was ameliorated in favour of potential house buyers we should have little difficulty in selling every brick we could produce. Unfortunately this amelioration failed to materialise in 1965. and the accumulation of bricks in stock which resulted from this, and from the additional curbs on public and private building, is a matter of common knowledge and widespread comment I am glad to say that we have been able to obtaid I. very satis- factory share of a smaller market. especially in certain parts of the country. We are quite confident of the future of brick as ah element of building in our country. We have demonstrated the part that it can play in all types of building in- cluding the present fashion for \"industrialisption\" at present being pursued by the a.Govrnment, often regZrdless of ec.ofi facts, and we are takiag otsW steps to secure the use Of ot Ã½own. products in some forms.of preb icaton. Pipes The deferment of build. ine. roadworks and drainaae schemes which took .place i 1965 had some adverse effect on sales during the last six months of the 1965/66 year. Sales, and orders for the first three months of our current year are an all-time record. There is an - ever-increasing demand for \"Deckon \" pipes both in this country and abroad, and a licence agreement has been nego- tiated for France. Agreements for licensing \"Deckon\" in Belgium. Holland. Luxembourg. Australia. Nevw Zealand. Eire and Northern Ireland are in the final stage of negotiations. Engineering: Despite an increas- ing demand within, the Group for engineering services, profts from outside contracts were well main- tained during the year. The ex- pansion of our European business has involved the manufacture of roofing tile plants for Germany, France. Switzerland and Austria, in addition to one for South Africa. and the works at Redhill have never been to full. Sa4d, Gravel and Ready-mixed Concrete: The merger with Inns & Co. has brought an additional 27 gravel pits and 7 ready-mixed concrete plants into the Group. During the latter part of the year profit margins were reduced by increased costs and fierce compe- tition. In the current year, how- ever, whilst it has not been pos- sible to improve profit margins, the overall tonnage sold of both sand and gravel and of ready- mixed concrete shows a significant increase over the same period of last year. I feel confident in fore- R60deso0 Qsu' l It has bee a. year of endtced demand from our -granite quatise, but the ift .l I W , sub bstantially, tbihhsuildl n this field by the addituon of four granite and lime- itone fuarries as a result of the Redlaid-anns merger. This brings our potential output up to well over 2.000,000 tons per annum. Road Cotractlagi The Cod- tractng Department of Wirks- W.ith. ua res Ltd.. a subidiary of tnaÂ» Co. Ltd., made a profit- able contribution to past accounts and has not yet been affected by the recession. I have no hesitation in predicting that they will con- tinue to give a good accountr of themselves,during the present and future years. Sei. and Damp Coeersm Amongst the many advaptages of the merger with Inns & Co. Ltd. is the Inclusion in the Redland Group of a company called Pelts and Damp Courses Ltd. The demand for damp coursea is still buyant and the busindes is being modernised and expanded over the next two years. Coanste Prodaetts The works at Barrow, near Leicester. achieved a satisfactory increase of profits over those for the previous year, but the Cullianworth works of George Geenwood & Sons (Hall- fax) Ltd. made a lower profit OVERSEAS INTERESTS Soath Africat The profit after taxation of Vereeniging Tiles Ltd. for 1965 amounted to Â£92,056 compared with Â£76,577 for the previous year, and although current reports indicate some reduction of this record figure, the outlook is still very satisfactory. Wetrer Gensamys Braas & Co. G.m.b.H. had adother good year in 1965, but the growth in profts was rather less than might have been exppeted, due to marketing diffi- culties m concrete pipes which suddenly arose during the latter part of the year. Another roofing tile factory is in course of erection near Nuremberg, and this will make the twelfth in operation In- cluding one recently acquired in the Hamburg area. There is every prospect that the profits of Braas & Co. will be, maintained during the current year. Austria: Brass & Co. have entered into a 50% partnership called Bramac Dachsteinwerk Gesetllschaft m.b.H. with Ebenseer Betonwerke G.m.b.H. of Vienna. The factory is being built at Pochlarn. near Melk, and should be in full production by next March. Redland * Brras- Bredero: In Holland, the first roofing plant to be built by our European Comn- pany at Montfoort, near Utrecht is now in its second year of opera- tion, and it is confidently antici- pated that the very satisfactory profit made in 1965 will be ex- ceeded by at least 25% in 1966. Fracse: After further protracted negotiations with the French Gov- ernment, agreement was at length reached for the 'formation of a new roofing tile company called Societe Francaise Redland in con- junction with our French partners. state of the economy, and the free. dom of action allowed to local authorities and to private builders. Fortunately there are already signs of awareness on the part of the Government that something must be done if the housing needs of the nation are to be met at any time in the foreseeable future. It is. however, certain that, pro- vided there is no real national economic disaster affecting every industry and every individual in the country, the time will soon come when we shall once again resume our temporarily interrupted progress. Chaurman' Additloal Remarks Addressing the meeting, the Chairman said:- I hope you will agree that the Report and Accounts including my Statement, give you a reasonably clear picture of our activities. You will no doubt have taken note of what I said in the last paragraph\\ of the Statement about the prospects for the immediate future, and no good purpose would be served by attempting to disguise the fact that we are going through a difficult period as far as our business in the United Kingdom is concerned. It is only right for me to say to you to-day, quite frankly, that, in common with many other companies of equally good standing, we muat anticipate some reduction in the amount of the dividend to be paid in respect of the current year. On the other hand, our confi- dence in the long-term future of the Company remains ,un- diminished, and in the meantime I can only ask for your patience until better times come round again, as come they certainly will. Our whole aim and object is to ensure that, when the restrictions are removed 'and confidence is restored to the building'and con- struction industry and it is allowed to get into its stride once more. we shall be ia a potition to take JWull dvatag of It PnIS Feru es | M-.- dweI; U - all this i such a logical and sen- sible cootse that I suppose there is not much chance of Its adoption i the Mar future. Sale of Eastwoods Froy Ltd. I would like to make a brief reference to the antouncement in the Press \"on Wednesday of last week to the effect that we are dis. posing of our merchanting Com- pany, EasI(wods Proy Ltd, Various shortened versions of the announcement appeared in the papers, and from some of these the impkession might have been gained that we are selling East- woods Froy for about Â£250.000. which is not the case at all. This figure only applies to stock, plant and motor vehicles at some of the branches, ten of which are being leased to Pratt Standard Range Ltd., with an option for a maximum period of 7 years, to purchase the land and premises. The rental we shall receive will be Â£21.432 per annum in con- trast to the trading loss of Â£94,000 incurred in the year to 31st March. 1966. Pratts are, and have been for many years, very good customers for Redland products and, as they operate to a large extent in the same area as that covered by Eastwoods Proy, it was only logical that they should acquire part of the business. The real benefit to Redland lies *of course in the accrual of cash to the amount of approximately Â£1% million over the next two years, mainly from the realisation of trade debts and the disoosal of the remaining very valuable land and premises. This large sum at present tied up in the merchanting business can be put to profitable use in the pro- duction and quarrying activities of the Company. The report and accounts were adopted.",

Service salary and pensioq iancrases wil require Fis.690m. more than in the last estimates. In Holland, Civil Service salaries automatically follow the trend in industry, where only a modest wage rise .next year is hoped for by the r.nvarnmont rovernment The schools and universities will require Pls.490m. extra. Together with relatively small sums .for the arts and recreation, the total suBa spent on all forms of education by the Central Government next year will be Fls.5.517m., which is well over a quarter of all Central Government expenditure and nearly double the country's defence expenditure which will reach Fls.2.993m. New Roads Some Pls.320m. more will be spent on housing, almost all of it on the Dutch equivalent of council houses, bringing the Central Government's total housing ex- penditure to Fls.2,354m. The social services will require Fls.130m. more, and so will the Ministry of Transport, mainly for new roads. Road users will be particularly hard hit by various tax measures. Petrol tax will be increased \" for one year only\" by four cents per litre (about 4d a gallon), with a corresponding increase in the road tax for diesel-driven vehicles. These measures will yield Fls.130m. Diesel oil will go up by 2.2 cents a litre; yield Fls.60m. In addition, the road tax for all cars and lorries will be increased by varying .amounts. according to their weight, so that the heaviest private cars will have to pay well over Â£30 a year in road tax. This increase will yield Fls.107m. Proposal Shelved Last year's \"temporary\" increase of company tax from 46 to 47 per cent., payable on all profits after depreciation, will be continued for another year, and yield Fls.43m. The Government appears to have shelved last year's proposal to give some compensation for this company tax increase by reducing the income tax paid by shareholders. Anothor hotly contested left-over fromh lot yew's Budget-the pro. posed introduction of Itax savings certificates \" maturing after five years -has also been dropped. A new bone of contention is being introduced in this Budget by the proposal that council house tenants earning more than about Fls.12.000 a year should pay a periodic levy in addition to their (subsldised) rent into the Exchequer, yielding FPs.7Om, a year. The sale of council houses to tenants will also be encouraged, and should yield Fls.45m. The 10 per cent. general rent increase' planned for January 1, 1967, will be post. poned by six months. So will the introduction of three costly new sick. ness and disability insurance measures. Purchase Tax A once-only boost to Exchequer receipts worth Fls.425m. will be given by bringing forward the final income tax demands payable by people with a taxable income of over, Pls.15.000 per annum who use the services of tax consultants. A Bill to increase the standard rate of purchase tax from five to six per cent.-annual yield Pls.680m. -will also be introduced, but this measure is not intended to take effect until January 1, 1968; the present Government's term of office runs out in May, 1967. Taxpayers will derive some con- solation from the fact that the income tax and PAYE reduction of Fls.710m. enacted in December, 1964. and due on January 1. 1967, will take effect from that date after all. in spite of much public heart- searching by the Socialist Govern- ment partners in recent months. For single persons between 40 and 65, this Budget even contains some extra income tax relief, which will cost the Exchequer Fls.40m. per annum..",

   "text_content" : "From Our Owna Correspondent DR. OTTO SCHEDL, Bavaria's wily Minister, of Economics, is try- ing to get together a consortium to buy natural gas in bulk from North Africa, probably Algeria or Libya. It is part of his tireless pursuit of cheap energy and improved transportation to create a basis for the progressive industrialisation of the South-Eastern corner of West Germany. Dr. Schedl first attracted notice internationally when he invited the Italian ENI concern, when under the dynamic management of the late Sr..Enrico Mattei, to set up Bavaria's first oil refinery. That forced the international oil con- cerns to speed up their own plans for Bavaria with the result that capacity has reached 11.5m. tons a year with more to come. His new venture has a similar twist against the big names in the world of oil and gas. Apart from its own resources, West Germany was expected to rely heavily on natural gas from the Netherlands. That would have given the whip- hand to the established oil con- cerns, especially Shell and Standard Oil of New Jersey. Dr. Schedi's proposal is for a consortium of Bavarian consumers-! towns, industrial concerns, and utility companies-to sponsor the .building of a pipeline from. an Italian Adriatic port. It would transport gas shipped across the Mediterranean. The potential market by 1970 is estimated at 180,000m.-210.00(m. cubic feet a year.. The amount could be doubled if more ambitious proposals BONN, Sept. 20. go through to bring in consumers elsewhere, including Austria and Switzerland. Even Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia are said to have shown interest. In the field of transport, Dr. Schedl has just chalked up a success, although he will have to wait for it to bear fruit. An agreement has been signed with the Federal Government to complete the long planned Rhine- Main-Danube canal by building the missing piece between Nuremberg and the Danube. Work is to begin in 1969 and will take untl 1981, It will cost about Â£150m. at to-day's prices. That will give Bavaria a direct shipping link to the Ruhr and the Low Countries with their seagoing ports. Together with work to be done on the Danube it will also complete an inland waterway reach- ing all the way across Europe from the North Sea to .the Blacl Sea.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "ii r-- : ~llr ''\"' ^ ' '' :\"' `?-j Â·tÂ· ,, Â·~ I: Â·: ~Â·' IF.: AFTER MONTHS of steady verbal bombardments, an armed trucp has been reached betwden Spanish ishmeal producers and consumers. Both opponents are now beseeching the Government for a favourable solution of their particular side of the problems in this \" fishmeal war.'* as the strife is called here. The issue is, as usual, a question of higher prices, and has been smouldering ever sisee the Government liberalised the imports of foreign fishmeal. The local producers have re- peatedly asked the Government for a protective import duty or the reduction of these imports. The president of the Fisheries Syndi- cate, Sr. Barrera, early this summer asked for a support price of Ptas.13.50 per kilogramme instead of the Ptas.12.25 (about Is 7d) guaranteed at present. \"Ruinous\" The consumers, represented by the Cattlebreeders Syndicate, answered that any inrease of fodder prices \"would be ruinous for us.\" The producers then pro- posed that local compound fodder factoriei should miix more than 1 per cent. of fishmeal into their products--\"a fair offer, consider- ing that idternationial practice is as much as 4 per cent\" Protests from the chicken farmers' sector were answered with calculations indicating that a higher fishmeal percentage in compound fodders and the requested high support price would have a cost-boosting effect of only about Ptas.0.03 on the produtcion of a kilogramme of broiler chicken or a dozen eggs. At this stage of the talks most of the syndicate officials and the Government adjourned for their vacations on the sunny beaches of Spain. Tranquillity reigned once more, but not for long. At the end of August the Canary Islanders -with the smoke still rising from their previous battle against the State-controlled La Tabacalera tobacco monopoly company-de- cided to go on the warpath once General Munoz Grandes cerned. From the capitalist point of view, too, the drastic measure had all the aspects of an -economic disaster, considering that most of the factory owners control sub- stantial participations in the fishing fleet. The Cattlebreeders' Syndicate immediately blasted back that the tie-up of the Las Palmas fishing fleet was \" an intentional mea- sure devised by people who are \\both shipowners and fishmeal manufacturers,\" that Spanish fish- meal contains 5 per cent. less pro- teins than the' imported products and that, anyway, even the Canary Islands had been importing Chilean or Peruvian fishmeal re- cently. The Islanders had to admit the truth of these facts and after blasting away once more with their side of the argument, the Syndi- cate bosses, got together, the Ship- some 30Ita waIs mndtor tbath ior* y to bosss had asked for bie situation became alarmint when the tieusp ran into its tenth day and tome 700 ctew members and over 2,000 factory workers had to be cared for as far as their daily minimum subsistence was con- odwers' Association sent a delega- tion to Madrid to see the Vice- ersuident of Government, General .MuSioz Grandes. And everybody agreed that the Government should decide the quarrel. Such a decision will, as the situa- tion looks at this moment, cer- tainly cost the tax-payers money. The Ministry of Commerce, embarked on an anti-inflation cam- paign, is fighting with jts back against the wall. Higher fishmeal prices make a good argument for cattle and chicken breeders to raise their prices. One Ministry spokesman tried to gain time by saying that new import licences had been denied, but the fishmeal manufacturers were quick in point. ing out the tonnage of foreign fish- meal landed here almost each and every week. These imports can- not be stopped if the cattle and chicken of old Castile are to be fed cheaply enough to reduce cur- rent imports of frozen meat. Back-firing Spanish consumption of fish- meal is assessed at some 120,000 tons yearly. National production reached about 30,000 tons last year, including about 20,000 tons produced on the Canary Islands. Slamming a protective customs duty on the 90,000 tons of fishmeal imported yearly would help the local producers but it was also having an immediate back-firing effect on meat and egg prices. A direct subsidy on each kilogramme of fishmeal produced locally might, perhaps, be a feasible solu- tion and not have an immediate effect on current foodstuff prices. However, with at least 70 per cent. of Canary Island fishing fleet owners also controlling fishmeal factories, what will happen when the crews of the fishing vessels ask for a bigger slice of the social cake 7 The increase of merchant marine seamen's wages was approved last month and once im- planted on the fishing fleet it may only be a matter of time until the clamour for higher fishmeal prices rises again.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondeqt A SHARP slow-down in productive industrial investment in France last year is announced by the Economic and Social Development Fund In its annual report. Investment by private companies was virtually stagnant, rising only 0.9 per cent. against 7 per cent. the year before. In the public sector the in. crease was 11.8 per cent.-well below the 15.5 per cent. recorded lih 1964. These figures provide another stroke of background colour to the French Government's recent efforts to bring about a recovery in private investment throughout the country. According to a recent survey by the National Statistical Institute, these efforts are in fact likely to bring about the first real upturn this year for about three years. The Economic and Social Fund provides some support for this view by predicting that total Investment will increase by 5.9 per cent. this year, or more than the expected rise in the gross national product, It goes on to report a 2.5 per cent.

   "text_content" : "Financidal Times Reporter BRT ISH Twin Disc of Strood, Kent, expects to sell axles worth S3m. a year to Canada following the initiative of several of its executives. The axles are required by a Canadian company which makes vehicles used in the country's logging industry. The war in Vietnam has caused specialist component manufacturers in the United States to cut back on their supplies.to foreign and non-military customers which has meant that a major Canadian manufacturing company has been unable to meet the production demands for its special-purpose logging equipment because of the hold-up in supplies of vehicle atles. British Twin Disc learned of this situation on August 30 and imme- diately cabled to Canada the speci- fication details of its own types of heavy-duty sales which have only recently gone into production. Then the company's chief designer flew to Ireland to examine the only k'nown example in Europe of the Canadian logging vehicle. Following this Mr. Rodney Hill. the managing director. flew to Canada with detailed drawings and prices of the axle. He then re- turned with a firm order for a sample pair of axles which had to be manufactured from scratcg and delivered within 10 days. This was done and now the company is awaiting confirmation of an order for 100 pairs of the axles worthS $100000. The yearly requirement Is esti- mated at 3,000 pairs worth S3m.",

   "text_content" : "By Our New York Correpondent THE U.S. it to have yet another' gala British export parade-though this time withnut Britain having to this time without Britain having to foot the bill! Caught up in the success and. hullabaloo of a series of British itore promotions in major Ameri- can cities, Bronxville, a suburban village a half-hour's train ride from central New York, has selected the theme, \"Conre to Britain-It's Only Blocks Away,:' for a fun and business festival it-plans to stage for 10 days from the beginning of October. There is a hitch in that Bronx- ville wants to recapture for its typically small, speciality shops some of the trade they have been losing over the past few years to large department stores and' super- markets in nearby suburban shop- ping centres. BronxVille seeks a reputation for these shops as suppliers of the highest quality merchandise and services, imports offer \" snob \" appeal and, as one of the focal Daughters of the British Empire puts it, British goods \" would be received very nicely here.\"? The British Government 'will supply display material and the British-American Chamber of Commerce in New York is circu-. larising members about the festival: but otherwise it is an all-Bronxville affair. Wealthy area Bronxville is a tiny town of under 7,000 people though, to- gether with a local enthusiasm that recently qold out an amateur. musi- cal revue td - standing room audiences it does have a certain claim to fame.

Among them is Charles Til- Iinghast, president of Trans World Airlines, and to set the ball rolling TWAwill offer a free round-trip ticket for two of the festival's visi- tots to go on to London and live \" on the house \" for a week at the Cumberland Hotel. Cricket The idea for the British show- it will be the first \"fall festival\" ever staged in Bronxville--ame from two officials of the local Chamber of Commerce, Robert Brody and Harold Fallon, who felt that their village had enough of a British fair-Britain took it over from the Dutch in 1664-to be able to make it a success. In fact, Bronxville is hardly the replica of a typical English West Country village, but with its timber fronted shops- it bears far more resem- blance to one than to the usual American \"main street \" suburb. Indeed, a few .of its older houses re actual reconstructions of former British homes Some of these houses will be open to the publi ddrinng the festi- val, which will -also feature the -American premiere of an award- Ã½winning British film, a 'cricket match (British beer might have been served, but the match will be played on school property and thus under the studs of the liquor authorities), ' streets lirned with Union Jacks. British floral displays and concerts- of British folk songs. The local station will be bedecked with British Railways potters and. as. a further plug for Britain's tourist trade, a British car may be -run between New York and Bronxville by the New York Cen- tral Railroad.. . , -. Alongdide -ourism, Ieanwhile,. British exports- will be given prominence as more than 100 local merchants organise window and other displays of British products and services. * In addition, there will b. a fashion' how, with a I well-known British designer on band for the occasion, while i Bronxville also hopes for the period of the festival to have a local branch of the British Trade I Centre which was opened this summer in New York. British manufacturers are lein4 offered free store space to display their wares at a prime location close to tlhe railway station and- important in a comhmunity where the average family owns at least two. cars-to a large parking area. t Brody, finally, is trying to persuade t at least one British dignitary to come to Bronxville to open the festival and, to alert residents of the village and nearby communi- ties, he has arranged for a direct mailing of 16,000 copies of a 1 British-slanted brochure, the Pall . Festival Times, in which he would i like to be able to print a goodwill message from the Queen. r Sim. target t Retail sales in Bronxville totalled S26m. last yeiar (they are B over S1,500m. annually for the I- whole of Westchester) and Brody t names a target of Sim. in business e to be generated at the festival. e While several British companies s have agreed to participate, he is r a little. disappointed that so far I \" the response has been greater on s the part of American than British companies.\" But the dbject is an \" j Ang o-American festival and at I. least the local liquor store-it s claims to be the largest in West- Y chester-mtends it to be cosmo- i politan.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent CAPE TOWN, Sept. 20. Mr. Vorster will be making his first major Parliamentary speech as Prime Minister to-morrow amid monuntin tensions over Sorth Africa's international affatirs. After a mere weik in office, a keen watch will be kept here on his performance for any hint of a change from Verwoerdian concepts, despite his broad pledge that \" I will walk further along the road set by Hendrik Verwoerd.\" The tone of his snech. however. me tone or nIs speecn, nowever, is expected to be governed by the three major international issues now facing the country: First of these is the implication of South Africa's insistence up to now of maintaining \" normal trade\" with Rhodesia, and the possibility that it could involve South Africa in mandatory sanc- tions to some degree; Vital Problems Second is South Africa's attitude at the United Nations General Assembly where Afro-Asian mem- bers areeexpected to launch a fresh onslaught against apartheid through the South-West Africa issue, and in spite of the World Court ruling in July which favoured South Africa; Third is the pattern of future relations with independent Lesotho and Botswana. These are all vital problems which the opposition cannot shirk from raising, even though it appears that a yawning chasm exists between these issues and what might have been Government policy under Dr. Verwoerd, so reat was his control over policy decisions. Internally, too, the opposition is bound to sound out Mr.Vo tr oh his attitude towards Bantustans and whether he also regards their ultimate destiny to be- svereign independence. All these issues come to the fore because, apart from Mr. Vorster's oft-voiced views on'State security and the role of the individual in that State, be is an enigma on the broad issues facing the Government. From his viewpoint, he probably could not have picked up the reins of Govern- ment at a more testing time, and if he comes through the debate with any measure of success he will. if nothing else, have proved himself to those of his Party who have doubted whether he is anything more than a party political strong- man. His overall tone is expected to be one of caution, leaving whatever initiative that there must be to come from the other side. whether over relations with Rhodesia or South Africa's attitude at the UN. , Whether he will remain inflexible on maintaining trade with Rhodesia, in view of the possibility of Mr. Wilson going to the U.N. for limited sanctions, remains to be seen. What- ever he decides will, no doubt, be strongly influenced by the informal talks he has been having here with South Africa's Ambassador to London, Dr. Card de Wet, who has been staying with the Vorsters at Groote Schuur, the Prime Minister's official Cape Town residence.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Latin American Correspondent BOLIVIA is understood to have been offered a $10m. loan by Japa for the xr-equipment of the Antofagasta and Bolivia railway, which has been run by the Bolivian Government since the withdrawal of its British managers in 1959. If Bolivia accepts the loan, there may be a further delay in the settlement, currently under nego- tiation of British claims for com. pensation for the take-over of the railway. The Antofagasta railway is badly in ned of new locomotives and freight ars to replac damaged and superannuated stock. The purchase of these was to have been financed by a World Bank loan which was made conditional on the settlement of the British claim. If Japan's credit offer, which would presumably be tied to the Furchase of Japanese rolling stock, is accepted, Bolivia may be able to avoid going to the World Bank, at least for the time being. This, in turn, would mean a relaxation of the pressure to settle the British claim. Earlier this year it' had been hoped that a settlement would be reached soon after thy inaugura- tion in August of the new Govern ment of President Rene oBarrientos,",

   "text_content" : "V.. ..* mo w TiB FUTURE of French Somali. land is well and truly in the melt in Last wek, President do S who was evidently shaken by the ifats that took place durin- bI theent visit to the epndency' capitl Djibouti, aid (trouth t medium of his aide, General Billotte) that the French Govern- ment would not oppose the grant- ing of independence-so long as the Somalis could express their demand properly and understood the implications of freedom. Last Friday the Emperor of Ethiopia, who was the President's cordial host immediately after the Djibouti furore, laid claim to French Somaliland whibh, he said,. had been \" one of the coastal terri- -tories of Ethiopia from time im- memorial until it was dismembered in the course of the colonial ex- pansion of the 18th century.\" Yesterday, another ingredient was added when Mr. Aden Abdullah Osman, President of the Somalia Republic, arrived in Moscow on a State .visit. as the clamour for independence reached a new peak at Djibouti. The two are not un- connected. The Mogadishu Gov- ernment is openly uneasy about the developments on the French coast of the Somalis. When President de Gaulle was there a fortnight ago, the Somali Ra'dio let off a ritual volley at him. It was delivered by the leader of 'the Somali Coast Liberation Move- ment who declared that the Presi- dent's visit was \"another of the frauds, and the biggest of them, by which the French Government sought to stay on the Somali coast.\" The Liberation Movement is a comparatively small group of political refugees from Djibouti. The Mogadishu Government largely subsidises it, but does not necessarily subscribe to all its politics. The group is maintained, not so much to further the policies of the Somali Republic as to pro- vide it with a counterweight for a similar organisation, based on the Afar majority of the Djibouti popu- lation, which is supported by Ethiopia and has its headquarters ijo- on the sed ent* ing them.. Undoubiedly, it must have kp!tw, aibout them, and par- ticipated' in the initial demonstra- tions which detonated the troubles -but it does look now that the real culprit must be looked for elsewhere. At the same time, incidentally, the Mogadishu Government strangely denied all responsibility. Hassan Elmi, the Somali Ambas- sador in Tanzania. said on behalf of his country that, unlike Ethiopia, Somalia laid no claims to Djibouti. It insisted, howevet, on self-determination for its inhabi- tants. And on September 1 the Somali Government-in a Note reported Â·by Mogadishu Radio- expressed its willingness to assist the French Government in its intention that the territory should achieve independence without out- side interference. Ambassador Elmi added: \"This territory is indisput- ably part and parcel of the Somali Peninsular.\" It was a deliberately cautious statement; no reference was made to any racial bonds or the \" sacred duty of gathering all the Somalis under a single flag.\" Somali Power Balance 1 I I r t I I t r t t 1 1 I r i Indeed, any outright joining of the French coast of the Somalis could easily spell disaster to the Mogadishu Government. The balance of power in that case with- in the Somali Republic would shift to the north, leaving the southern capital and its Somali Youth League leaders, mostly of the Darot tribe, who constitute the Government, high and dry. The power would shift to the well developed international port of Djibouti with a tightly knit local Communist Party. Its membership is nmixed-French, Somali and Ethiopian-and its authority is impeccably Muscovite.. Th4s, an unconditional attach- mnent of the French coast.of the Somalis to the Somali Republic could profit only the USSR. The Russians have suffered several re- verses in these parts of Africa in recent years. Ethiopia has close links with the U.S., and finally. Moscow has not been invariably pleased with the UAR. Its newly appointed Prime Minister, for ex- ample, in his past capacity of the Aswan High Dam overlord, over. ruled the Russians time and again. If, and when, the British move out of AdenI President Nasser is bound to try to move in on it, and it would suit his book if the present political situation in Djibouti re- mained unchanged. It could evolve into a realistic arrangement with Ethiopia. The last thing, however. President Nasser would want is a strong Soviet bridgehead at this faraway backdoor of Egypt. Unrestricted Soviet Aid Already, some years ago, the Somali Government, dissatisfied with the insufficient practical re- sults of Nasser's patronage, decided rather incautiously to ride the tiger of unrestricted Soviet aid. They are now trying to check it by soliciting Italy for additional sup- port-including pensions due to Somali veterans of the Ethiopian- Italian wars-and by appealing for help to King' Faisal of Saudi Arabia in the name of Moslem brotherhood and of somewhat spurious blood kinship. However, the Soviet arms and instructors continue to arrive in Somalia in a steady stream, and the renewed outbreak of the \" Djibouti independence movement\" was timed to impress the Somali leaders with a clear notion of who is the holder of the trump cards in this particular gamd. It may not fit the pattern of the current Franco-Soviet friendship, but this considetation is unlikely to worry the Soviet leadership.",

   "text_content" : "The 43rd annual general meeting of Lafarge Aluminous Cement Company Limited was held on September 20 in London, MR. J. G. BeEVOR. O.B.E. (the chair- man), presiding. The. following is his circulated statement: Mr. J. T. Ruffer retired from the Chair ht the end of the sinan- cial year under review. I am glad to confirm that he is prepared to remain on our board, and will. sub- ject to your re-electing him under the necessary special notice, con- tinue his long and valued service as a director, having first been appointed in 1925. Your board have done me the honour of elect- ing me to the Chair in his place. I now have pleasure in presenting to you the directors' report and accounts for the year 1965/66. The year under review saw a general slowing down of invest- ment and latterly a marked falling off in the starting of new construc- tion and building projects, though there was some improvement in the public sector in March 1966. Indus- try in general has felt the pres- sure of rising costs. and in our own business the profit margins, which had been strengthened by the price increases of July 1965, 'ad been inevitably eroded by Mo.bh 1966. 6roia, Trading Results and Tax Changes The results of the year's trading show a group trading profit of Â£653.514 (previous year-Â£684.775) and a group profit before taxation of Â£529.059 (Â£533.436). Taxation, mainly on the new basis of cor- poration tax at 401\". required Â£173.608 leaving Â£310,206 profit after taxation and after deduction of minority interest This figure compares with Â£255.017 last year, but in making the comparison we must bear in mind two factors- first that the tax requirements of the dividend payment in a full year under the new corporation tax will be higher; and secondly that Scottish Construction Company had no tax liability this year due mainly to accumulated capital allowances. The interim dividend on 1st April 1966 was paid net, after deduction of income tax which was retained by the Com- pany, but the final, if approved, will be paid in accordance with the 1965 Finance Act, which means that the income tax deducted by the Company will be paid over to the Inland Revenue; the effective cost to the Company of the final dividend this year, and of future dividends, is therefore the gross amount, instead of the net amount as in the past. However, so loni as we maintain our conservative distribution policy, the new system of corporation tax is beneficial to your Company. The Parent Compaty-Ce at Sales volumes of principal pro- ducts, Ciment Pondu, Secar. Alag and Frodingham, fell slightly in 1965 but recovered well in the first quarter of 1966, ending up almost identical to those of the previous financial year. Trading profts, however, on these products were down by approximately 8% due to continuing cost increases inCludW ing labour costs. As regards raw materials. I am glad to report that our require* ments of imported bauxite seem to be-reasonably well-assured for the immediate. future.' Subsidlarles True Flue Limited has continued to expand both in turnover and net profits but the expansion was assisted by the absorption of the small refractory department re- tained from the sale of J. Bar- tholomew and Son Limited. Grow- ing demand is being reinforced by the new Building Regulations issued in February -1966 requiring all new chimneys to be lined, and with a materials specification well suited to True Flue products.

In the latter part of the year Perdio Electronics Limited went into liquidation and your directors decided to purchase the trading assets. The business is being carried on under the new name bs., Perdio Products Limited and is a wholly oWhod subsidiary, of your-. Company with its own distinptive range- of productsg, Perdlo Products Limited made a net profit of Â£50,540 to 31st March, 1966, and I feel therefore that your directors' decision to make'the purchase was fully Justified. It has been decided that It would be more practical from a trading point of view for our financial year to end 31st December, and the next accounts for the Company will run to 31st December, 1966. Whilst your directors do not recommend a dividend for the year to March, 1966, I feel confident that we will do so for the next period which will be nine months to 31st December, 1966. May I take this opportunity of thanking my co*directors, staff and employees for their very close co-operation and splendid efforts during the year. Further to my recent statement, I am pleased to say that to the end of August sales are still over 50% up on the comparable period of 1965: This is due to: (I) an Increase In Dansette sales brought about by new models released In the early part of the year and which have been favourably received in the trade. (ll) the additional turnover with Perdlo Products. This large increase in turnover is most welcome considering the effect of the Government's edonomic measures and leads me to feel that the profits for the nine months to 31st December, 19I6, will be better than for the corresponding period in 1965. the report and accounts were adopted, Group Trading Profit for the Year ..........................

Mr. Jo Grimond do as much damage as pqssible to the image.of the Government and the Labour Party. In the second emergency resolution - on the economic situatioin-to be debated. on Thursday, the executive deplores the short-term character of the Labour Government's policy on prices and incomes, and points out a series of consequences which it considers highly dangerous. These include a permanent coercion of the trade unions or a flood of wage increases when the thaw is per- mitted, an end to productivity agree- ments. and the creation of artificial shortages through the price freeze. Attack on Labour Over the longer term, the executive has agreed to an intensive campaitpn this autumn to extend Liberal in- fluence in industrial areas. The aim will be to put over Liberal industrial policy of co-ownership and to erode the Labour vote In these areas. In fact. the intention of the Liberals throughout the assembly will be to attack the Government on a wide front. There will be none of the qualified support of the \"balance of power\" days before the last elec- tion. Liberal speakers will claim that Harold Wilson is as much a Tory as Edward Heath and the Liberals will be presented as the only radical party.",

Tentative soundings on the possibility of setting up tariff preferences between Ireland and the Common Market, made here to-day by an Irish Ministerial delegation, were blocked by the Commission, on the grounds that it would contravene the rules of GATT. But the Irish delegation, led by Mr. Frank Aiken, Irish External Affairs Minister, received sympathy from 'the Comamission delegation when it asked for a reduction of the Common Market tariff on Irish cattle exports. Traditionally. tre- land has exported some 30,000- 40,000 head of cattle to the Six every year, notably to Germany, but the full application of the common external tariff has cut this trade down to nothing. Cattle Exports The Irish Government is now hopeful that the Germans will apply for a tariff quota for Irish cattle, ad they did three years ago for Danish cattle. Though to-day' talks were evidenty inconclusive, Mr. Aiken said afterwards' that the meeting bad been very satisfactory. It had touched on a wide range of subjects affecting Irish membership of the Community, and the two delegations had discussed in some detail the present seven-year Irish Pfan in relation to the Community's medium- term economic planning. But Mr. Aiken made it clear that the Irish Government's policy was still to join the Common Market' at the same time as Britain. or imme- diately afterwards, and not to attempt to join separately. Since 70 per cent. of Ireland's trade is with the U.K.. it would be unwise, he said, to erect a tariff barrier against Britain, while the Free Trade Agree- ment with the U.K. is a useful pre- paratory phase for' wider free trade with the test of Western Europe. To-day's meeting is the first of a t series of contacts at Ministerial level which the Irish Government is plan- ning to have with the Commission in the coming months. The Agricul- ture Minister, Mr. Charles Haughey. will visit Brussels before Christmas, and he will be followed in the New Year by the Ministers of Industry and Commerce.

Demand for ervices is heavy at peak burs, low.at other times. Norly 90 per cent of the Puangers travel only three miles or less. In tlh next few years the bus system will be reshaped so as to eet these costraint more eff-ctvely. Ndwv.buses, new equipment and new-type routes are being devised. A report, Remaphsg London's As Services, which outlines the sweeping changes which are to take place, has just been published by London Transport. Here ae its main points: 0 One-man-operated buses extended throughout the fleet, making possible fewer but better.paid staff. * Many routes shortened to minimize the effect of traffic congetioa. * More coin-in-the-slot 'Red ArrqWhtype buses in the heart of Lonon and nw flat-fare single-deck sawvices over short '*atellite' routes in the suburbs. These buses will carry large number of standing passengers and are designed to speed the journeys of the commuter and shopper. * New methods of collecting flat fares on the busy short routes, and electronic equipment to take graduated fares on the longer routes which cannot be run economically otherwise. Ultimately this should enable all buses in London, single-deck and double- deck, to be single-manned. * Improved interchange between buses, Underground and British Railways. This new deal for the bus passenger in London will not happen overnight; but a start is being made and every part of the plan will be pressed forward as rapidly as possible. The action dutlined in this plan - primarily.to be taken by London Transport but needing the co-operation of other authorities at many points - is designed to assure the London bus traveller of a service fitted to his needs, London Transport hopes that many of its passengers will write to the Publicity Officer, London Transport, 280 Marylebone Road, N.W.l, for a copy of this report, which is priced one shilling and will be sent post free.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter Oxford Street, London, is becoming a \"civic disaster,\" Prof. Colin Buchanan, author of the report on traffic in towns, told the International Road Federation conference in London yesterday. In blunt criticism of planning in Britain and, particularly, in London, Prof. Buchanan, professor of Transport at London University's Imperial College of Science, also deplored the situation at Piccadilly Circus and South Kensington. Exhibition Road. he contended. was an \"exhibition of what was unacceptable in a civilised city.\" and he described Cromwell Road as \"murderous.\" But the professor's hardest stric- tures, during a debate in which nine speakers took part, were on Oxford Street. As probably the busiest shopping street in Europe, possibly in the world, he sug- gested that delegates might feel inclined to agree that it was also the most uncivilised. \" I simply refuse to believe that the turmoil of pedestrians and vehicles in this street, the noise, the stench and the general misery of the street when it is raining, with bus queues waiting in patient wretchedness, are things that should be accepted in this age of science in what we are pleased to think of as a civilised city.\" Transport Problem This and other examples could be repeated in varying scales in every city, town and village in the country, Prof. Buchanan declared. Unless environmental difficulties were accepted as an integral part of the urban transport problem, just as important as the difficulties of move. ment and parking, then urban areas were heading for disaster. On Oxford Street he said that th: buildings were in process of total re- construction-\" but it is difficult to see that conditions in the street are being improved one iota in this process.\" Of Piccadilly Circus, the Professor remarked that in spite of the com- plex pedestrian system below the surface, there was \"as unhappy a mixture of vehicles and pedestrians on the surface as could be imagined.\" The motor vehicle, with its un- rivalled versatility, must be provided with sufficient road space. But if that were undertaken without regard to the overriding need for creating or restoring acceptable environmental conditions, then the consequences for cities could not be other than disas. trous. Speaking of public transport, Prof. Buchanan asserted that there would seem to be advantages in giving up the idea that it should be profitable, and accepting frankly that in prac- tically all circumstances it should be run as a public service. Mr. Walter Bor, city planning officer for Liverpool, agreed that the question of co-ordination of transport was an extremely difficult matter. but he would add one further problem- the diversity of conflicting political interests established in the larger conurbations of this country. \"The first step to solving this problem is for all constituent authori- ties to participate in a land use- transportation study to arrive at bases upon which the futare transport plan can be constructed.\" he-stated. Such a study was being undertaken in several city redns, Including Merseyside, where three alternative patterns of arowth would be; investi- gated. It would not be easy to obtain an agreement and even more difficult to implement it given existing fragmen- tation of ownership and authority. Mr. Bor pointed out. Still on Paper Presenting a paper on motorways for Lancashire, Mr. James Drake, country surveyor and bridgemaster, Lancashire County Council, regretted that too many of the motorways planned were still on. paper. It was hoped that work would start early next year on the 22 miles of the M61 and Manchester-Preston motor- way and to complete the whole length by 1971.",

This is a completely re-styled Viva, with an en- larged engine, more interior space and new suspension. Prices for the new model at its predecessor. This means that the Viva, which in its earlier basic form competed op virtually level terms with a number of moiels of rather smaller size or older design- including Ford's Anglia de luxe, the Morris Minor 1000 and Austin A40 from BMC tnd the Hillman Imp-now costs significantly more. In price and specification, it occupies' a class more or less of its own between these models and the two national best sellers, the BMC 1100 (Â£625 in basic form to Â£795 as a Riley) and the Ford Cortina (Â£659-Â£825). Viva prices range from Â£579 to Â£708. Curving Lines The new styling, with softer, more curving lines and rectangular headlamps, and the new suspension closely follow the general lines of recent designs from Opel. the highly successful German sub- sidiary of General Motors. The body is now roomier, the cars being 61 inches longer and 31 inches wider, but it remains a two-door although access to the rear seats is easier as the opening is wider. The engine has been increased in size to 1159 cc from 1057 cc, and maximum gross power output is now 56.2 bhp against 50.1' bhp. A \" 90I\" version with 9 to 1' com- pression ratio instead of the standard 81 to 1 is available, as hitherto. This has a power output (gross) of 68.9 bhp compared with 60 bhp pre- viously. The increased capacity of the engine has been brought about by widening the bore from 74.3 mm. to 77.7 mm., the stroke remaining at 61 mm. Otherwise there are no significant alterations in design of the engine. i Rectangular headlamps have been adopted and give the frontal appear. *ance of the Viva a new look.' bright metal embellishment is restrained, and varies on the three body styles- Viva, Viva de Luxe and Viva SL.

An improved system of heat- in and ventilating has also been adopted. Transmission remains unchanged. with an all-synchromesh 4-speed gear- box, but front and rear suspension has been redesigned to eliminate a tendency to roll on corners. Coil springs are now employed back as well as front. Other models in the Vauxhall range have undergone only minor altera- tions, directed to safety, comfort and appearance. They are the Victor 101 and 4/90, the Cresta and the Viscount. Prices have been increased for the new Viva range. The standard saloon now costs Â£41 more at Â£579 including purchase tax, the De Luxe is up by Â£37 to Â£626, the SL by Â£41' to Â£672, the De Luxe \"90\" by Â£45 to Â£663 and the SL \"90\" by Â£49 to Â£708. Other Vauxhall price changes for 1967 are the Victor 101 Super saloon and estate car, and the Cresta, where the price has gone up by about Â£21 to allow for the inclusion of heaters, C C '\"-"

   "text_content" : "F By ELSBITH GANGUIN o01 THE WftOt$i3 K. em- chologists, although bas test-minded, are also wary of them. Pirsonalit tests were * orinally s devis m psychiatric to an hould.: reitai just that, they told enc.. Btt others, and possibly in growing num. bert, bqlieve that provided hlings are 'not takn too far, that is, into the realms of sex and religous beliefs, such tests can be of considerable vale. I myself am one of the ants- test brigade. One personnel director thought that anybody as \"anti\" as myself was prob- ably \"motivated \" by the know- ledge that he or she would never pass a test anyway. Be that as it may, I nonetheless volun- teered to take a personality test -of sorts I Only on Trial Although reported to be widely app'led in the US., this test published by Applied Psy- chology Associates of Brookline, Mass., and called Kostick's Per- ception and Preference Inven- tory (PAPI) is at present only on trial in the U.K. PA Management Consultants is trying it out on its own em- ployees and is comparing the results with its actual knowledge of these people. There is no suggestion as yet that the test may ever be used as a recruitment tooL It is not even certain that the consultants will use it as an adjunct to personal interviews. But any- thing which could make selec- tion more effective in the long run should be tried. \"You can measure a man's intelligence, and his knowledge of indus- trial processes, during an inter- view. but to measure what motivates him is almost im- possible,\" I was assured. Anyway, it took me 10 minutes to make a choice of 90 double questions. However \" non-applicable \" I thought any of these questions were, I had to say that either I was a hard worker or I was not moody. Secondly, I had to decide whether I would rather be known as likiig to do better work than others; or as liking to keep atWhat Iwas doing until finished.. And sb it went on. Basically *the \"statements preferred for the 20 vectors for PAPI\" (I'd hate to have to explain what this means) are grouped into such pigeon-holes as \"n \"-the need to personally finish a task; \" g \"-role of a hard, intense worker; \"a \"-need to achieve; \"I\"-leadership role; \"p \"-need to control others; I\"--lipUlsive type; *t \"-on* the-go type; v -vigorous .ype;.\" x need to be noticed; a\"--ocial type; and so forth, adding up to some 20 \" type- casts. I did have to consider such embarrassingly \"intimate \" revelations as \" I like to make a close personal friend,\" or \" I try to make close personnel friends,\" and even to admit (or otherwise) that it bothers me when someone dislikes me. But at least sex was kept out of it all. In fact, I answered every question purely as a working person, and not as someone stripped bare on a psychologist's couch. And so it remained as objec- tive as any subjective self- analysis can ever be, and it turned out to be enjoyable. The chore done, my preferences were market. Apparently a week's course is sufficient to learn this job, or at least, the rudiments of it. Added up, my personality profile was plotted on \"Kostick's Perception and Preference Inventory,\" a kind of astrologist's sign-of-the- zodiac-chart. Interpretation But as soon as the consul- tants began to interpret this somewhat weird, Hampstead. Bank-Holiday - Fairground - like chart, my amusement subsided. What they got out of it-I had never met either of them in my life before-was indeed \"me.\" Well, at least I agreed that I am a \"very organised, capable thinker,\" but then, who would not ? When it came to my \" sur- prisingly high interest in de- tails \"-and \"terrier-like desire to finish a task \" mixed up with \" liking power, but not particu- larly interested in status. ' I-felt immediately called upon to qualify many of these findings. I dug into my working past; I described how I had been \"made\" into being \"socially intraverted with a need for security, but not prepared to be warm and outgoing other than with few and selected people,\" and spiritedly defended my apparent recognition of the need for rules, supervision, and authority (though they did throw in that at least I am not a \"follower \" I). Crux of the Matter And this is really the crux of the matter: used as a tool at interviews, such a test makes candidates loosen up, look at themselves, argue over the \"paper\" evidence, and thus give would-be employers much more information than an ordi- nary face-to-face talk could ever elicit. If a test can serve such a purpose, it is, I think, worth- while to have. The danger re- mains, however, that in un- skilled, or semi-skilled, hands it can become a farce, or, indeed, misleading. To dub a person as \"relatively unambi- tious\" without probing deeper into the why's and wherefore's, or to award an accolade simply because the forced choice of questions seems to. indicate that the candidate can \"make deci- sions easily and quickly,\" can be doing more harm than good to the recruiting game. These days the cost of taking on the wrong candidate can be considerable. Mr. A. G. P. Elliott, the personnel director of Standard Telephone and Cables, told me not so long ago that where STC relied on interviews alone, one in eight appointments had turned out to be a \"howling mistake,\" and two in eight were serious ones. Testing-and they use per- sonality tests at STQ-however, had reduced the \"howlers\" to one in 11, and the serious mistakes to two in 11. Still not compretely con- verted, at least this one test I took myself has left me wonder- ing: there could be something in it after all.",

And though the regions of the world which it is primarily designed to assist have so far manifested far les enthusiasm for it than might bave been hoped, this is certainly an event of considerable import- ance for countries as deeply in- volved in the international private investment tralic as the U.K. Landmark Reached The Convention, which was pre- pared by the World Bank with the assistance of a legal committee consisting of representatives of 61 governments, was submitted to member countries in March of last year on the understanding that it would enter into force 30 days after it had been both sighed and ratified by at least 20. govern- ments. This landmark was, in fact, reached last week when the Netherlands completed the ratifl- cation drill and the Convention will accordingly enter into force on October 14 nest, What this means is. that in a few weeks' time the world will be equipped for the first time with an international centre to which investment disputes arising be- tween governments and foreign invest or example on the question of the compensation to be paid for the nationalisation of public utility undertakings-can be submitted for conciliation or arbi- tration. I say \"can be submitted.\" For adherence to the convention does not force a country to submit to the judgment of this international organisation if it doesn't want to. It only obliges it to consider con- ciliation advice or comply with an arbitration award once the Centre's intervention has been in- voked. But even though the system stops well short of com- pulsory adjudication for invest- nlent arguments, it still represents a major improvement on the present position. For one thing, the very fact that the problem of the unresolved in. vestment dispute is considered sufficiently serious to warrant the creation of a special machinery to deal with it should serve to under- line the need for host countries to extend fair treatment to fortign in- vestors. It should also encourage signatory States to make use of the new Centre's services when disputes arise even though they don't have to. So should the fact that to refuse to do so for. no very good reason, once having accepted the idea in principle, could plainly expose a country to the charge of being two-faced--and thereby E jeopardise its chances of attracting a further investment from abroad. A further point is that the arrival s of the Convention on the scene i puts foreign investors with a t grievance against another State in a a position-always provided both t their own. and the other c6untrv concerned are signatories-to act in i their own right instead of having I to rely on their governments to act for them. Then again, though dis. putes can be submitted to the Centre only by agreement between the two parties, that agreement does not necessarily have to come aftet the dispute has arisen. Such consent can be given in a c clause included in an investment f agreement providing for the sub- c mission to the Centre of future i disputes. It may also be given in t advance by implication if a State C offers in its investment promotion N legislation to submit disputes i arsing out of foreign investment to the Centre and a foreign investor l accepts such an offer in writing. i C Support Patchy t There are two other things that t should be made clear. One is that a investment corporatidhs are re- I garded for the purposes of this new < machinery as nationals of the a country under whose law they are I incorporated-except that, where I foreign companies have been forced for the purposes of investment to < be incorporated in the host country, I they may also be treated as the I nationals of another State if both I parties agree. The other-and ( most important-is that the new I mechanism can cope only with I legal disputes. Thus, while conflicts I o rights are within its jurisdiction, 4 conflicts of interests are not. However, notwithstanding this ' and the other important limitations I from whicRh th. EonvAntioa n ss &r. investors in the capital exporting countries should find countries that adhere to it more attractive-other things being equal-than those that do npt. And it seems surprising, therefore, that the interest taken in the idea over the world as a whole so far has been much less keen than might have been expected. Support, it is true, has been on an appreciably larger scale than may be suggested by the present ratifications total of 20. For, in addition, another two dozen or so countries have signed the Con- vention and will accordingly be adherina to it when ratification formalities have been completed. But the signatories total of 46 it still less than half. the World Bank's membership. What is more, a third of the acceptances to date are in respect of the major indqus trialised countries of the world- that is, capital etporters-the only countries in this class that have I not yet come in being Switzerland and Canada. Among the less-developed States, support has been very patchy indeed. African States have taken to the idea like ducks to water, accounting for all but a quarter of the acceptances received from under-developed countries. There has, however, been relatively much less support from Asia and the smaller of the advanced countries and-most .disheartening-practi- cally no response at all from Latin America and the Middle East The \" Dissidents \" This mass holding back by countries that stand to gain most from adherence to the new con- cept is evidently attributable in an important degree to the suspicion that a State that subscribes to the Convention will render itself more vulnerable to foreign interference in its affairs. Since a signatory is not compelled to submit a single dispute to the arbitration centre if it doesn't want to, this suspicion can be said to be without founda- tion in the strictly factual sense. But one would have thought that, even if participation in the scheme meant exposing a country's actions more fully to outside opinion in the moral sense, the surrender of sovereignty involved was in such a good cause that it would be well worth making. Perhaps many of the \"dissi- dents\" will eventually come to realise this. They should be helped to do so by the near cer- tainty that capital * importing countries refusing to commit them- selves even in this limited sense to behave like good debtors will find themselves gperating under an in- creasing handicap in the battle for the limited supply of private development finance entering Inter- national channels.",

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "THE GOVERNMENTS deci- sion that the Clydeside produc- tivity agreement should be exempted from the wage freeze will be a great relief to both sides of the industry. The agree- ment provides for a relaxation of demarcation rules between the five sections of the Boilermakers' Amalgamation in exchange for an increase in hourly rates of pay. It has been welcomed by the employers as a major im- provement in labour relations and an important contribution towards the modernisation of shipbuilding practices recom- mended by the Geddes Commit- tee; the Prime Minister himself, in his recent address to the Trades Union Congress, singled it out for special mention. Yet there was until yesterday a serious risk that the agreement would be held up by the wage freeze and that, once postponed, it would be allowed to lapse altogether. A Precedent ? It has finally been allowed to slip by on the grounds that a large number of the men in- volved had already received pay increases related to the produc- tivity deal before the freeze began-an argument that Mr. Jay, in a speech at Fairfields, put forward several weeks ago. The question now is not so much how far the facts of the case have been stretched to make an exception of the Clydeside agreement as how far others affected by the freeze will seek to take advantage of the prece- dent. There is, for example, the British Oxygen agreement. This, on the face of it, is the model of a productivity bargain: by agreeing to work more flexibly and accept new machinery, over 4,000 employees of British Oxygen are to produce the same output and receive the same pay in a working week reduced by 15 per cent. The men have co-operated enthusias- tically in suggesting means of increasing efficiency and the management hopes that this is only the first starp in a con- tinuing drive to improve produc- tivity. Yet to receive the same pay for fewer hours is a formal breach of official policy, and Mr. Gunter has been seeking to persuade the firm either to modify its scheme or abandon it altogether. British Oxygen has not so far complied, nor would it find it easy to do so. The new schedules are already being worked and cannot be changed without caus- ing a tremendous amount of upheaval and ill-will. The Minis- try itself admits the difficulty: its officials are discussing with the company what can be done, and by the time these discussions are concluded the period of absolute freeze may be over. If this happens without causing a crowd of )thers to claim simi- larly exceptional treatment, everybody will be content. But the Government is in a serious difficulty. It is in a way absurd to bar, even temporarily, arrange- ments which provide for higher pay or shorter hours in exchange for genuine increases in produc- tivity: the Clydeside agreement, in particular, is something that the industry has been after for years past. Yet once it is con- ceded that productivity is a reason for exemption from the freeze, the freeze is as good as over. Every union will at once claim higher productivity as the grounds for a wage increase, even though the rise is wholly imaginary or tiny in relation to the higher pay demanded. Even genuine productivity agreements, moreover, may sometimes do less good to the country than to the individual firm if the higher pay they entail is at once passed on by union pressure to other companies in which no such agreement has been reached. This whole question is being considered at present by the Prices and Incomes Board, together with the ques- tion of what to do about lower- paid workers. Crucial Answers The answers that Mr. Jones provides to these questions will be of crucial importance for the second half of the freeze, which is to be less absolute. For the moment, the Government can only stick to the policy that it has announced and accept the inevitability of being unfair in some cases and absurd in others. If it does succeed in finding ex- ceptional circumstances to justify it in letting obviously deserving cases by, well and good. But if the exceptions are allowed to multiply, the policy will fall.",

   "text_content" : "AT FIRST SIGHT, Mr. Peart's speech yesterday might be seen as an indication that here and there-and very cautiously-the Government is beginning to relax the credit squeeze. In fact, all the Minister did was to set out the existing position In order to reassure farmers who, as always, seem to have been anticipating the worst. Ever since this Government set out its agricultural policy, it has been under pressure from the National Farmers' Union. All along the farmers have been anxious to see the maximum expansion of British agricultural output. With the balance of payments under pressure, they have been able to argue that any additional home production would save much. needed foreign exchange. Caus for Concern Since the tightening of the credit' squese, the agricultural industry has been given an addli tlional cause for concern. No other Industry Is as dendent on crdit as farming. It is there fore tempting-and some have yielded to' the tmptation-to ascribe the recent sharp alls in the prices of cattle, sheep and barley to the farmers' inability to borrow or to fears that they might be unable to raise cash, In Tact the drop in cattle prices appears in the main to be due to an easing of the supply posll tIon, while a certain amount of the barley which has boon coming on to the market from this season record crop has been sold because for one reason or another It cannot be stored It may well be that there has ben some selling In anticipation of the sharp squeeUe on agricultural credit. If so, Mr. Peart's Itate* ment should have stilled those fears. He has now told the farmers that the banks will mit their normal seasonal requirements Thi ils no eparltre from eneri Yllo. e directives to the clearrng baks have always made alwance for seasonal vatios Sbnk nd . And a rm In$ Omm ty aI a ho a Sr b ith oa ba lld ungctub. farmers were at an all-time peak. Banks will also consider sym. pathetically, Mr. Peart states, requests for medium term credit for stook-rearing. Since this represents a direct contribution to the balance of payments-a saving in Imports is Jut as valu. able as an addition to exports -this is only right and proper. It is the farmers who want loans for other \"essential purposes\" who will have to take their chance with industrial borrowers who need bank money to finance investment. Mr. Peart has thus related the basic principles of the Govern. ment's farm policy to the present crisis. There has bymn no change In the Government s general line, which is to encourage a selective expansion of agricultural output to meet rising food requirements. But it continues t rejept, the, argument that Ai and every form of agricultrl production should be expanded an order to save imports. Ecan citerla will continue to bpI ed. And, In particular th overnment remains anxious to se an in. orease n n produ y, merely because this lon greater profitability but also because It wants to see addi. tional manpower released from the farms to industry.

NE of the first things that the House of Commons will do when it reassembles next month is to give the Tees Valley and Cleveland Water Bill its third reading. This hardly sounds the stuff to send the Par- liamentary temperature soaring. Yet the Bill, which began its life almost by chance towards the end of last year, has become a national, indeed an international issue. Much more will be heard of it this winter, as it progresses through the House of Lords. Already strange alliances are being forged, and behind the dull wording of the Bill's title lies the clash of principles that would have made a meaty episode in The Power Game. Weird Paradox The object of the Bill is to gain permission to build a reser- voir so that Tees-side will not be short of water in the next decade. The possibility of a serious shortage of water still appears as a weird paradox to most inhabi- tants of this damp island. Yet it is already acting as a con- straint on industrial and regional development. Indeed, in Essex, one of the dryest parts of the country, housebuilding plans have been drastically reduced and there are at least four other areas where industrial expansion will have to be preceded by major schemes to provide extra water-South Wales, the North- West, Humberside and Tees-side. Now that Manchester has ob- tained Ministerial permission to \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t tap Ullswater and Windermere, the needs of Tees-side have be- come the most urgent. Indeed, such is the urgency that ICI, easily the largest indus- trial user in the area, has said that unless a new source of water is provided in the next three years, it could lose Â£45m. a year from production losses should there be a bad drought after 1970. This would make a grim story for one of the most promising growth points in the north-east development area, since if ICI had to cut back pro- duction it would clearly be impossible for others to expand. As a result, the Tees Valley and Cleveland Water Board is des- perately anxious to start work on its proposed reservoir at Cow Green, in Upper Teesdale, next spring, since three years' work is involved. This time-table is endangered by the efficient opposition lobby group which is centred on the Teesdale Defence Committee, an amalgam of the major botanical and conservancy interests in the country. During the committee stage of the Bill in the House of Commons a number of dis- :inguisbed botanists gave evi- ience supporting the Defence Committee's case and the Com- nittee claims that it has received some 40 letters from botanists abroad. Also ranged against the Bill are two statutory bodies, the Nature Conservancy and the National Parks Commission. As an indication of the depth of feeling in the country, the Com- mittee points to the Â£10,000 it bas received from members of the 500 naturalist groups dotted about the country and expects no difficulty in obtaining a fur. ther Â£7,000 needed to continue .0 n is 9. If d it e e Is 1- ts rÂ· ie 1* h It Is r* n y it /, the fight Over and above its 1 parliamentary work the Commit- 1 tee has issued pamphlets and is I organising a public meeting next month. The hard core of the opposi- tion case is that a reservoir at Cow Green will destroy some plant communities, whjih, are unique in the world, and will threaten same, others' because of the effect which a *reservoir may have on the area's micto-climate. In the words of one-pamphlet, \"Upper Teesdale is an area of international biological import- ance which must be preserved in its entirety.\" Although none of the plants themselves are unique, the way in which they are grouped together in small communities is not, apparently, found elsewhere. The Commit- tee claims that only recently have' the tools, which make it possible to study the ecology of the plants in detail, become avail- able. Although the area is already well frequented by . botanists a good deal of work apparently remains to be done. d Alternative Sites The Committee puts forward e two alternative sites for a reser- e voir in the area. One would take , three years longer to build and f would be three times as expen- 1. sive; the other would mean it flooding agricultural land and if destroying a number of proper- d ties. There is also the possibility ts of obtaining a certain amount of r. water by boring holes in the oe lower Tees Valley. The short answer ns tho *Wat\" RntarA to that any alternative would mean delay, and at this stage delay is dangerous. ICI is in. the throes of a vast expansion programme, both in ammonia and fertiliser output and in synthetic fibres (the cutbacks in nylon output are taking place elsewhere). As a result its clean-water require- oments will double from 25m. gallons a day to 50m. The Water Board's present capacity is 65m. The Cow Green reser- voir will give it another 35m., most of which it will need by the early 1970s. Although ICI is the main customer, other big industrial users in the area, such as Dorman Long, will be increas- ins their demantds Complicated Issue Superficiallyd togetherefore, the arveum the toos like a sraigit classhible etwe stindustry and the naturalists, between what is most profitable in the short- term and longer-term but less quantifiable values. In practice the issue is more complicated. On the one hand the protagok nists of the Blll doubt the scientific case of their opposiu ties. The reservoir tself wpossibill only cover 17 acres of the area which Is botanically valuable, out of some 5,000 acres. They do not deny that these 17 acres are extremely important, but they do not agree that there would be such a change in the micro-climate that the rest of the section would be seriously affected. Nor do they feel that affected. Nor do they feel that there would be any damage to the wider area which is of botanical interest. On the naturalists' side there is a clear feeling that Upper Teesdale is a crucial test case for conservancy generally. In the words. of one of them, \" if we cannot save the unique Tees- dale plant conimunities, then the whole British natural fauna and flora is penaced.\" Clearly the Cow Green reservoir would do some damage to the flora, although how much and how important this would be appears, to the layman at least, contro- versial. But the Teesdale reser- voir is only one of a long line of investment projects hiich are affecting flora 'and' fauna throughout Britain, whether they are power stations or new sac- tory sites. More reservoirs will have to be built. If the con- servationists can halt the Cow Green project they feel that they will have a far strobger influence on future developments. The conservationists are in general attempting to make the industrial and economic case for Cow Green appkear dubious against an undentble scientific , argument for keeping it as it is. The Water Board'and ICI are attempting precisely;the reverse. Main ttack One of the Tesdale Defence Committee's mail4 lines of attack r is that the Cow Green proposal E is a result of bad'planning. ICI - did not give thO Water Board t enough notice of their increased g requirements on 'the one hand while on the other Cow Green s will have to be supplemented by s another source ps water well , before the end of the century. r So why use it at all? ICI and s the Water Board vigorously refute this. The nature of invest- ment decisions in industry is such, ICI argues, that they have to be made rapidly. It knew a that there. was a huge potential y for water in the :area. Indeed, that was one of the main reasons why it decided to build its ammonia plants in this 'country I at Billingham rather than over- seas close to the sources of naphtha. But assuming that ICI's huge investment pro- gramme is a once-and-for-all effort, there is no reason why the 06w Grceodreserv6ir will not be adequate for several decades. a In the wings, tdo, there lurks t the possibility of other cheap i sources of water, such as atomic I desalination plants. Currently this is not an economic alterna- s tive for Tees-side. But as natural a sources of water b6come increas. . Ingly expensive to tap and dis- tribute, desalination plants, even B barrages, will become viable alternatives. What the Teesdale I controversy shows is that water L is now a significant economic variable and the long-range plan- ; ning of the new Water Resources I Board is badly naeded. What t seems almost as important is ) that Interested groqps should be B consulted as early in the plan' Sing stage as possible. ICI dirao F tors must be keeping their flngers t crossed as 1970 approaches. -----",

   "text_content" : "Sir,-T he object of my previous letters to you about the national airo has been to draw attention to the cost of launching such' a schme. Mr. O'Brien now agrees that this may cost a million pounds. I have never disputed that a case can be spade for a national giro-I question whether at a time of national financial stringency, a better use of the money cannot be made (whether it comes from the taxpayer or from Post Office funds). Mr. F. P. Thomson (September 15) suggests that a national giro is a necessity to a country \" bur* dened with one of the most ineffi- cient and slow money and credit movement systems in Europe.\" This preonpposes that the projected national gIro will be more efficient than the present system-but will it? If Mr. Thqonson will go into any bank he should see displayed a notice issued by the Council of London Clearing Banks, which reads \"The banks have to give notice that for reasons outside their control delays continue to occur in the collection of cheques and other Items, and in the transmission of credits.\" It is obvious that this refers to late delivery of mail and Mr, O'Brien in a letter to The Guardian (September 15) admits that 8 per cent of the 37m, letters handled every day are not delivered at the proper time, and that this is 3 per cent more than was the case a few years ago. Will Mr. O'Brien tell us what the percentage delay is for letters dealt with in the City of Lndon? The banks have already been forced at certain times of the year to collect London Office letters at provincial centres and send them by special messenger to a meeting place, to be exchanged for clearings coming from Lordon. If this is the position regarding normal mail to-day, will it be any better after the giro has added further burdens to the already over- strained postal services? What guarantee will there be that the special giro envelopes will not be subject to similar delays to those iffered by normal correspon- dence? It any priority is to be given to giro envelopes this can oniy be at theexpense ordinary I now add a second question to ny original query regarding the desirability of launching a giro scheme at this time. Could the money not be better spent in an effort to stop deterioration in the postal service-which if allowed to continue will endanger the success of the national giro scheme when it Is in operation?

We thought that the \"proba. bility \" of a prize within a year or two made investment in premium bonds a better proposition than In equities. In three years, a Â£25 prize was won. Most of the bonds were therefore, cashed (and re-Invested in equities); our holding since then has been between 100-150 savings bonds-so far without any prizes. In 1959 I noticed the numbers of a few premium bonds which had won unclaimed prizes. I was struck by several \"groupings\" of the winning bonds. If one had bought, say, 500 (and another member of the family had bought another 500) within the same grouping several prizes would have been won from the same holding. I wondered whether ERNIE was absolutely random. After courteous, and very ex- planatory, correspondence from the Premium Bond Office, I was still unconvinced. Despite the best will (and scien. tific knowledge) in the world, is it really possible to build an utterly random machine? Is it not likely that a machine made by men must inevitably (though inadvertently) have some human non-randomdess introduced into it? V. E. DAwsoN. 149, Park Road, Teddlnglon, Middlesex."

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Reporter S l ley GiDel, Ford managing drector in the U.K, toil38 shop steward conedon- from 19 Ford plants Ia Loadok yesterday: \"We still believe It ill be posible to ainabtan a five4ay woirkng week.\" Ford is not categorically stating there will be no short-time this winter. 'Company reviews of 'stocks are normally made for a founweek period and it is therefore safe to assume there will be no short-time working at Ford during-October. i-0vucVucr 1is iraUUiODuY it most difficult month for all British car , manufacturers, even - when there is not a recession. - It how- ever remains possible that full-time Workin - will be maintained througout November by ncour- agng export agents to take their stocks a little earlier than usual. Ford exports about 50 per cent. of its U.K. production. Mr. Gillen got a good reception from the shop stewards. The geerai impression among them afterwards was that Ford was in fact doing its best to maintain a five-ddy *eek. Riding the crisis Mr. Gillen pointed out that Ford had cuitdown on overtime fairly early in *e summer in anticipation of the squeeze. Although at the momenti the company was riding the crisis, be insisted there 'could be no guarantees. \" Obviously, no one can predict with certainty just how deep the Government's econo- mic measures will bite and we are consequently keeping the situation tnder review.\" The meeting with the shop stewards was an annual get- together planned some time ago. In its drive for better com- minications Ford has been having. meetings between. shop steward convenors And top management for the past three years. Ford is ilso anxious to k6ep the goodwill ds its shop stewards be- cause it plans to introduce a new wage- structure after the freeze. At a meeting. next Thursday with union .leaders the progress of a general wages survey will be dis- cussed. Speaking' at another conference in London yesterday Mr. H. W. Batty, director of Ford's car and N A-- truck group, said the economic background to any year-good or bad-was that 60 per cent. of new can were sold int the first six months and 40 per cent, in the second. Thir meant that 200,000 fewer sales in the second six months than in the first. \"It was clear to. us that this would be a dificult autumn a long time ago. In May, therefore, we made a careful alalysis of what we thought would happen from August onwardi. \"We have enough capacity to meet - home and export demand and are expanding overseas mar- kets as fast as we, can. We have also had to face major economic measures in Sweden, Denmark, Fin- land, Ireland and Australia, and have shipped nothing to Rhodesia for a very long time. Nor are there any new overseas markets- we know them all,\" Mr. Batty stated. Continuous Review \"While they will develop, they won't develop overnight to suit our convenience.\" he went on. \"In the first six months our exports increased by over 10 per cent. over last year. In spite of our efforts, the second six months will not in- crease so much. so you can see that the squeeze at home is no panacea for achievements abroad.\" \" It would be pleasant to be able to'predict the next six months, but the effects of short-time working antd redundancy elsewhere in the British. motor industry is itself having an effect on the motor market, which is stillvery sensitive. There are signs of a pick up in this month, but they are too small to prove anything. We are therefore keeping the situation under con- tinuous review \" _s .~~-- -~-~",

The outlook for sterling and for the negotiations on the reform of the international mone- tary system are expected to dominate the annual meeting of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers, which onens here to.morrow.

The British delegation, beaded by Mr. James Callaghan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seems likely to give a mildly opti- mistic account on both subjects, and the chief interest of the meet- ing will be to see whether this account entirely convinces their ^nlrtHÂ«ian-Â»r After the vicissitudes that the Â£ has been through since the last Commonwealth Finance Ministers' meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, last year, and in view of the recent somewhat restricted agreement of the Group of Ten on liquidity, one's impression is that Britain's Commonwealth partners will be doubtful, but anxious to be persuaded.

He can also claim it as evidence that the international community. has finally been convinced by the latest British programme of Britain's willingness to do what is necsfsary to 4efetid the present On the question of the liquidity negotiations, the problem, as at the Kingston meeting, will be to persuade the less developed countries (and, perhaps even more, the developed Common- wealth countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, who are not members of the Group of Ten) that Britain and Canada are really standing up for their interests in- side the \"rich men's club.\" Mr. Callaghan will be able to say with some justice that he has .done so. He has fulfilled his pro- mise made at Kingston to keep them informed of the negotiations, and a meeting of senior Common- wealth financial officials in London in July reviewed the situation. Mom important, the Chancellor can claim a victory for the less developed world in the agreement of the Group of Ten to proceed with the-second and wider phase of the negotiations in which the less 'developed countries will be repre- sented through their membership of the IMF.

It has had a useful morale-boosting effect within the plant, especially in small com* panies, and the presentation of the award (by the Lord Lieu- tenant of the county where the plant is located) has been the occasion for large-scale local celebrations and publicity. The smallest firms have probably benefited most. The general manager of Cundy and Son of Sudbury, Suffolk, which was \"decorated\" for exporting seeds, says the award has greatly boosted its image among seed growers; it has \" put us in with the big boys\" and brought the firm's name before the farming community. Even in the largest companies, well-known for their exporting achievements; the award has had some significance. In ICI, for instance, the exporting award went to three divisions- Pharmaceuticals, Fibres, and Dyestuffs; there is now consider- able pressure on the other divi- sions to win an award for themselves. The same applies to English Electric. Equally, of course, there is a strong incen- IS THE QUEEN'S AWARD to Industry worth having ? Most of the 115 firms which received the first awards in April believe that it is. and indications are that the number of applications for the second set of awards (which close at the end of next month) will be considerably larger. Companies may be dubious about the commercial value of the award, but the sight of their deadliest rivals sporting the emblem in their advertisements, on their products and in their buttonholes is bad for morale and bad for public relations. Naturally some firms would be even more excited if it involved some monetary gain \"why couldn't it be like the Institute of Advanced Motoring and save us something on the insurance,\" asks one winner), but the pres- tige factor alone is worth having. he 1 w )to Icnt ived ieve ions ards next ably ious : of heir the :ItUI heir Irale ons.

When Mr. A. L. Della Porta of Premier Drum is asked what the emblem in his button- hole means, he almost always finds that his questioner has never heard of the Queen's Award. There is a vague feel- ing of dissatisfaction among a number of winners that more publicity has not been de- voted to the scheme. It is of course, largely up to them to do their own publicity. but it was a pity that the announcement of the awards was handled with such secrecy (on the lines of the tive for, say, ootes and ABI to be on next year' list, because their principal rivals have already won the award. In several industries there were only one or two winners, like Wiggins Teape in paper or Per- pamon Press in book publish- ng, and their rivals will no doubt be anxious to join the club, Firms which applied last year can do so again; some un- successful applicants are at a loss to know the reasons for their rejection. Most of the award winners fly the Hag over their offices and factories, and many of them have distributed badges to all their employees. They have used the emblem in their promotional literature and in their overseas displays A. Monoickendam, the dia- mond cutters, reports: \"We have had new customers approaching as both here and abroad. The Americans are award-minded and we have found it recognised over there. But something more tangible would be useful.\" The award has probably brought commer. cial benefits to some of the \" technological\" winners. Lytag, a member of the Laing Group, which was honoured for techno- logical achievement in building materials, says the award \"underwrites the material, so that people know it must be good. Some winners believe the possession of a Queen's Award have helped them in negotiations with Government departments.

In this way it might be possible to highlight the achievements of some of the outstanding small and medium- sized firms which are as un- known to the general public now as they were when the list was first published. Perhaps, too, the British National Ex- ports Council, which is always interested in case studies of successful exporters, could play a role in publicising their achievements. There is a move afoot .to form an association of award winners which would put some collective effort into making the scheme more widely known, both at home and overseas. Of course, there are some firms which ale not anxious for too much publicity. (One farm machinery firm complains that British farmers dislike exports because they think it involves late delivery at home, and foreign countries dislike im- ports because they would prefer the equipment to be made at home. But there is a wide- spread feeling that more could and should be done to follow up the award and to make it more of a nationally recognised -and, if possible internation- ally recogsed-dtinction. t is clearly essential that, as the number of award winners increases (perhaps the first year's list was too long?) in- terest in the scheme should not be allowed to fade. The asso- ciation of Queen's Award winners should not become too exclusive a club, but it should be exclusive enough to show that its members have done something really exceptional. There is no doubt, so far as the first 115 winners are con- cerned. that their achievements are remarkable: the trouble still is that not enough people know about them.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPWANY STAFF Over much of to-day's com-. pany announcements there is more shade than light. Calico Printers reports lower profits (see .Lex Page 1) and the state- ment from British O(ygen indi- cates no departure. in the third qparter from the situation dis- cl6sed at the hAlf-year. Share- holders of Reditd' were warned at the meetn t expect a reduc- tion in divied next time; Holt asa Co. while repbrting dend; Metropol IndusiWries has had a setback and is knocking 15 points off the year's total payment. But Amalgamsated Detal (see Lex) has bigger pro- fits to show for the first half. Metropole Industries At- the half-way mark last. year Mebropole Iadustries was clearly finding the going more difficult, although profits were expected to be' \"close to those of 1964-65.\" In fact, this turns out to have been a rather optimistic assessment, for pre-tax profits are down by 16 per cent, to Â£455,000 and the dividend is drastically cut from 45 to 30 per cent. Cover is still only about I YA times after a corporation tax charge of 23.9 per cent., so 'there are cer- tainly grounds for harsh measures. Next year there will be the interest charges of last December's Â£1%m. debenture charges to bear. Last year's problems do not really concern the engineering divi- sion which more or less maintained its profits. But there is another loss of about Â£40,000 on Fibrepyle in the packaging division, and the -steel stockholding company in Scotland suffered a 50 per cent. profit reduction. Fortunately, Clover Industries did almost as well last year and Fibrenyle is now making a small profit, but the general outlook is no better. In view of the fact that the lower divi- dend rate is clearly not invulner- able, the shares are realistically priced at 6s I %d, where they yield almost 10 per cent. and sell at 7.9 times earnings. Hoist The preliminary figures from HoIst, civil engineers and con- tractors, are a mixture of good and bad. The good point is that against a forecast of a 25 per cent. increase in profits, the actual rise is much better with the pre-tax figures up 43 per cent, to Â£435,000. The bad point is the dividend, cut from 15 to 12% per cent. Holst's explanation is that with SET calculated to skim off Â£50,000, work in hand 12 per cent. up on a year ago and turnover cur- rently running roughly the same amount higher, it needs the extra money. This seems fair enough in one respect. Although profits are much higher, so is the tax charge-33.6 against 17.5 per cent. Allowances. which have been financing growth so far are being replaced bv invest- ment grants, and capital spending has turned down which means a tax charge of this proportion from now on. On the other hand, shareholders seem entitled to some considera- tion, especially considering that there are earnings as high as 27.6 per cent, to cover the reduced pay- ment; and the saving of Â£25.000 from the dividend cut is negligible in relation to cash sow which is still running well over the Â£400,000 mark. - At 9t 9d the yield drops to 6.5 per cent. However. the share price has enough behind it to stay put- a 6.9 PIE ratio and the almost'cer- tain prospect of higher profits for the next year or two. George Ward Considering the depressing.fl6w of news from the shoe industryin recent weeks, Gorge .Ward'H*ld. lags' preliminary figures are prob- ably better titan anticipated. Ignoring acquisition expenses,* tre- tax profits are sli htly up at Â£458,000 and the dividend is 12% per cent. again which, with ,i main- tained 2% per cent. bonus, is backed by earnings of nearly 23 per cent. Like others in the trade Ward suffered from rising wages, leather prices and other, costs. But even more damaging, the Dutch subsidiary swung back into the red again with a . Â£46,000 loss-it proved impossible to make satis- factory sales within the Common Market-while an ingestion period following the George Webb acqui- sition precluded any immediate contribution from that source. At this stage prospects do anot look over-exciting for the current year either. During - 1945-66 retailers stocked up in the face of higher leather prices; but with these now off the peak, there seems little inducement for them to do so again at present, even assuming they had the bank facilities. How- ever. Ward is still doing quite well with 'sales of branded footwear, while Webb brought several whole- sale companies into the group to broaden its activities and can be expected 'to add its quota in due course. At 10s 4%d the shares yield 7Y per cent and sell at 8.7 times earnings which seem fully to discount immediate uncertainties. Executer' Clothes Although a company might still be doing well. the outlook this winter tends to. discount a good first half. Executex Clothes is a case in point-pre-tax profits were up from Â£36,000 to Â£76,000 at half- time last June, but the company is now flinding some fall-off in de- mand. Retailers are destocking and as a manufacturer of better- quality men's suits and outerwear. Executex is not sufficiently confi- dent to make a forecast. This' rather clashes with the interim divi- dend of 10 per cent. on capital in- creased by a one-for-ten scrip issue. Admittedly waivers will reduce the actual distribution. but if the final gets the same treatment the rate will be 22.5 against an effective 20.5 per cent. In the past, Executex has con- ducted a fairly realistic dividend policy-drastically cutting the rate in 1962-and there is no reason to expect this to change. Cover on 22.5 per cent. would still be 1% times, even if overall profits re- main at a standstill, so there ought to be a chance of this happening at least. Reorganisation and new machines improved margins in the first half. liquidity is good and the company is well-equipped to take advantage of a resurgence in de- mand. Assuming a dividend of 22% per cent.. the shares yield 13.3 per cent. at 7s and are selling at just over six times earnings. This seems to take care of most risks,",

   "text_content" : "All the Rank Organisation's contemplated capital expenditure has been reevaluated, with the result that some of the programmes and plans have been either cancelled or post poned, reports chainian Mr. John Davia. o The effect on the cash flow-last year over Â£18m.-will not be immediately discernible, but will in coming months become more positive in its effect. more positive in its enect. While, therefore, additional short-term finance will be needed, \"we are not contemplating the issue of further equity capital or convertible loan stock,\" declares the chairman. The cut-back in the capital pro. gramme was brought about by the material changes in the tax basis relating to the substitution of invest- ment allowances by \"other invest- ment incentives.\" He stresses, how- ever, that commitments are made well in advance of the work being carried out-they were about Â£8.6m. (Â£7.6m.) at June 25, 1966. Investment Grants Investment allowance relief was available in 1965-66 for only just over six months of the year and amounted to Â£700.000 Had the previous baski obtained, the benefit for the whole year would have been Â£1.75m. Further overseas investment is \" virtually prohibited \" by the \"drastic fiscal measures \" taken by the Govern- ment and must have a serious effect long-term on organisations with large overseas interests such as RO. Apart from the tax disadvantages, there is the necessity to purchase premium dollars for all authorised expenditure outside the U.K. which is a heavy burden. Nevertheless, projects in pro- gress must be completed at a heavier cost. Exports over Â£33m. Mr. Davis points out that British owned establishments abroad are an important factor in assisting exports from the U.K., and the present policy \" must result in stagnation.\" RO's exports rose to Â£33.68m. (Â£25.87m.) in 1965-66. As stated on September 2. RO's profit before charging interest and taxation again increased significantly from Â£15.19m. to Â£23.5tm. in the year to June 25. 1966. The dividend is held at 21 per cent. to comply with the Government's request. The significant increase in group orofits this year arises from Rank Xerox sales which rose by 65 per cent. and profits of which were more than doubled, Mr. Davis is confident that Rank Xerox will continue to grow at a fast rate. The film interests have been able to ancrease their profits in the face of rising costs and severe competi. tion. Against an Industry decline in cinema attendances of 11 per cent. In 1965.

This division has re solved its management problems, but in the last quarter its results were adversely affected by the additional credit restrictions imposed in Febru- ary, 1966. Sales to date this year are running \" well above \" those of a year ago. He stresses, however, that it is difficult to see Ae radio and television industry becoming \" really profitable \" until a colour television service is established in the U.KC. The electronic section suffered severe problems which required drastic policy decisions and this has resulted in an exceptional loss. The hotels and motorways division suffered a loss of Â£625,000 during the year. Five new hotels were opened and at the year end 13 hotels and three motorway service areas were in operation. Members are told that while it is accepted that hotels in the period immediately following opening rarely make a profit, the loss was somewhat larger than anticipated. Talking Typewriter A joint venture has been entered into with the Responsive Environ- ments Corporation of America to exploit outside the Continents of North and South America \"a revo- lutionary new educational system,\" sometimes referred to as \"the talking typewriter.\" The operating company is Ragn- REC whose share carital of Â£600 is owned as to 49 per cent. by REC of America and issued in considers- tion of distribution rights throughout the world, except the Americas, and as to 51 per cent. by RO issued for cash. In addition, RO will provide Â£70,000 of loan capital when this is required. \"We see considerable potentialities in the long term for this new development.\" Mr. Davis repeats that his confi- dence in the long-term future of the Organisation remains unchanged but short-term It is much more diacult to forecast. \"Of one thing I am sure, the results for the current year should show an improvement,\" he adds. However, this improvement is more likely to be effected in the second half than the first. The manaing directors of the divi: sions have reappraised their activi* ties . . . cutting out those activities or products which do not give an adequate profit margin,\" but the full benefits will not be immed tely realised. Future contributions to profits will come from new ventures undertaken In recent years which are now coming Into operation.

Jobs Tax On the jobs tax Mr. Davis says ft will bear \"somewhat heavily\" on the organisation. Representations made to the Government have so far been unsuccessful, and as a result the approximate net cost in a full year would appear to be of the order of Eim. Commenting on the report at a luncheon yesterday, Mr. Davis said the future of the cinema industry hinged on the monopolies report. It can either give a lift to the cinema industry or it can have an adverse effect. I do not know. He described Rank Precision Indus. tries as \"a diversification which was already producing results.\" The Rank Organisation had no regret whatsoever about going into the hotel field of activity, he con- tinued. Asked about the position of part. time workers. Mr. Davis said it had been accepted in the entertainment industry that the very nature of the business lent itself to part-time local workers who could not move away and in whose case therefore the question of redeployment did not arise. Lord Mabane has, owing to \"indifferent\" health expressed his wish to retire from the Board after the meeting. Meeting. Porchester Hotel, W., October 13 at noon. See Lex Page 1",

   "text_content" : "I mely bought a wel.haown make of oeteetor heater. It i Md twt o te IP com. M\" wae as follows- (a) Tis guariantee i la substltutis for say warranty or coadilloa or Iabflt Imped by law or othevr (b) TUi gSrantee I valid only while the appliance remain e property of the origina owM. I e not nad he guarantee formn sce I believe that defect occurring within a reo. abe period would be covered by the'Sale of Goods Act. Is this so, ad f It Is would I seek resdr from the supplier or the manufacturer? Tho implied warranty under the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 is that the goods (being a \"well-known make\" which we presume you asked for) are of \"merchantable quality.\" If you did not ask for the make, but bought on the vendor's recommendation, then there would be an implied condi- tion that the goods were reason- ably fit for the purpose for which you required them. This all relates to the state of the goods at the time of purchase; and it by no means follows that a subsequent defect inevitably means that the goods were not as warranted at the time of purchase. All kinds of things may have happened in the meantime. It is for this reason that guarantees such as you have been offered are commonly accepted, as it reduces the possibility of dispute, although the guarantee is narrower than that under the Act. Your remedy (assuming merely that the goods were imperfect, as distinct from being actually dangerous) would be against the actual vendor, the persons who sold you the goods, and not against the manufacturer. You would not normally be able to obtain damages for damage caused by the defect in the machine unless it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that if there were defects of that kind it would be likely to cause that particular kind of damage. But we think that (a) does exclude liability for this kind of damage. We do not know what took place between the vendor and yourself in the shop, but it may be that the goods were sold to you on the express footing that they were covered by this guaran- tee and not by the statutory warranties, in which case you would have no choice but to accept such guarantee. AN I.O.U. Should a date be put on an I.O.U.? Is it a satisfactory security for a loan? Does the Statute of Limitations apply to it? An I.O.U. is an acknowledgment of a debt. The date when it is given is important, because the limitation period of six years will run from its date, assuming no later partial repayments or further acknowledgements in writing. It is not important to put t data actually on the I.OU, alhoui it Is material to be able prove when it is actually given. Hence it is convenient to record the date in this fashion. An I.O.U. is a perfectly satisfactory acknowlsedg ment. TITLE TO LAND I am egotiatnag for the purchase for business purposes of soM church property and am nrbb to get anything by way of title for It earlier than a conveyance to the vendor a 1945. Do yeou think it would be dangerous to proceed? Have you any expedr eace of similar situatious? Many \"church\" titles, all over the country, do not depend on title deeds, the land having been in the ownership of the church virtually \" from time immemorial.\" We think that in such cases you will have to rely upon a 12 years' possessory title; and this, at any rate, the vendors are in a position to give. If it is of any comfort to you, we can say that no church title with which we have ever had to deal which did not depend on title deeds has ever proved bad- although it is fair to say that we have not dealt with more than about half a dozen. Why not see if you can insure the title, and what the premium would be? This pro- cedure would at any rate give you some idea of what the insurers rate. the odds, and you could then act accordingly. LIQUIDATION I hold second debentre after the bank for 110,000, and have an unsecured loan of 210,000 in a company of which I am a dire&c tor. The bank loan is Â£10,000 secured by my signature. I do not think the company will make much headway. Can I place it in liquidation? How do I do it and to what extent am I liable for the company's debts apart from the bank loan? Certainly you can put the corm* pany into liquidation very easily by demanding repayment of your unsecured loan of Â£10,000, and, when it is not paid, presenting a winding up petition to the Court. To such a petition there can really be no answer. You will not be liable for the company's debts (apart from the bank loan) at all; but if you con- tinue as a director during a period when it becomes clear the com- pany can never pull round, you might become liable for its debts as being a person concerned in the company trading \"fraudulently\" for example with intent to defraud its creditors..

Instead of positive credit-rating of reliable customers, organi- sations relied on exchanges of information on defaulters. That was ineffective and such information was, in itself, defamatory and was, therefore, treated as highly confidential by the reporters. \"\"M i. a *s..+ .a 6-0nlrrs aban \" This means that mistakes about identification of defaulters could cause inconvenience to innocent parties without their being aware of the reasons for discrimination against them.' he stressed. The Consumer Council con- sidered that when a person asked for credit, he ought to be prepared to give the trader details of his income and commitments. Under the existing credit-rating system, the borrower relied on the person or firm lending him money to check on his credit-worthiness. \"The practical solution to the problems of indebtedness is an effective credit-rating system which would provide the customers with evidence of their credit standing that would be reliable and readily available to the trader.\" he said. Under a positive credit-rating system the borrower would, take the initiative by going to a credit-rating bureau which would supply him with a card giving evidence of his credit- worthiness.",

Mr. Norman Sloan, director of the Fbderation, said that the Geddes Relpot suggested that the number of n ns should be reduced from 37 to five. Although the unions were con- sidering It, it was likely that it would be a long time before this was achieved. Although the Boilermakers' Amal- gamation had brought In the ship wrights and the,, blacksmiths, there -was still a number of metal workers not covered by It, and there were still demaration disputes within the The employers eonsldefed the new common shipbu11lng a prenticeship schme. a good r; young men trained as siIPb U~ins workers first having both abasl trade they would a nohe to mov fram one trade to another.

   "article_dc_title" : "Touchdown at Windsor",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN SPRINT HANDICAPS at Windsor are hazardous affairs from the point of view of the off-course punter, for the draw exercises a considerable influence on this Thames-side track, and many a presumed certainty has failed to overcome the disadvantage of starting from a low number. However, the draw apart there is no denying but that Touchdown, even with 9 st 7 lbs in the saddle, is the pick of the runners for the Dorney Handicap (4.0). This four- year-old colt by Buisson Ardent, .won a good-class handicap at New- market in the spring, and though he has not scored since, his form in his two most recent outings bears the closest inspection. For example, last month, in the Lavenham Handicap at Newmarket, he finished third to Top of the Pops and Creole, conceding them 12 lbs and 2 lbs respectively, since when Creole has won the Nottingham Stewards' Handicap under a big weight, and Top of the Pops has failed only by a whisper to capture the Ayr Gold Cup. On his last appearance at New bury on September 9, Touchdown finished close-up fifth in the Watcombe Stakes at Newbury behind Litigation and Boilng, the last-named of whom won easily at Brighton a few days later. Touch- down is suited to firm going and is a confident selection. Belle of Ireland, a Milaen lily, U mall, but the can run ist anÂ« has only once beeA unplaced iDill raes this season. She held 6n0IU to defeat- Heavenly Soand a drivinsg.ln'if h bt Ooodwoode.lt TM 11Ã½w) month, and she may lead all the way in the Englefield Green Nur- sery Handicap (3.30). Two other possible winners at Windsor this afternoon are Arabian Gold, who seems fairly treated in the Eton Wick Handicap (4.30) and Midnight Marauder, who may win the Winkfield Plate (5.0). L. Piggott travels to Pontefract where he rides several fancied horses for different stables. He will, I think, win the Autumn Handicap (330) on On Probation trained by his father-in-law; F. Armstrong. His mount, Drake's Shanty, will probably start favourite for the Whitley Plate (4.0). But the one I like here is French Vine, a pro- gressive type of two-year-old by French Beige, who performed well, in spite of being baulked in run- ning when close-up fourth behind Privy Seal, Countermarch and Pddykin over seven furlongs at the Doncaster St. Leger meeting. A race confined to apprentices who bhave not ridden more than six runners can scarcely be regarded uas representing a safe mediumn for investment. However, it does look as though Renardier has an out- standing chance nl the Nostell Apprentice Plato (2.30). The obvious danger is Tandem, but from what. I hav seen of Mr. -Robin MoAlU'rI' Premonition olt, he Is d. lu(ily'aota boy's rldeA and youg -P. Oraham, who bilel p atttlns t about 20 lbs vMerwtgit, do well if be can pg to to hbUom of him. ~-#rues33",

Business in Stock Markets was still at an extremely low level yes- terday but, helped by a further rise in sterling, the recent firm tond was well maintained. Gilt-ededd, while still a good market, appeared to be undergoing something of a tech- nical reaction. A very firm start, which enabled the Government broker to raise his selling price of the 6 per cent. Funding \"tap,\" was followed by profit-taking. Final gains were much more modest than * on Monday, ranging to about V%, with the close Y or so below the best. Gians In the new debenture and loan stocks were also more modest, but there was still a fair public demand and prices of a number of the leaders reached the equivalent ps about .5 points above the 98 per cent. issue price 'of ICI's 66L. loan stock. This heightened opti- -mism about the success of nkxt Monday's issue, which still ap- peared to be having a' restraining effect 6n business because of the big sums apparently being set aside for application purposes. Prets reference to the start to be made this week on exploratory talks about the Government's post- freeze plans had no effect on senti- ment in equities and, in the absence of fresh Itcentives, buying activity was very limited. Price movements were mainly small and mixed, but there was a slight hardening ten- dency 'lthie leaders towards the close.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent TOKYO, Sept. 20. Indonesian delegates to the two-day conference of creditor nations expressed disappoint ment to-day that the 11 nations represented failed to reach agreement on a common period of morAatoriAn on Indonesia debt payment. Insp.-Gen. Alexander Pandelaki of Indonesia's Finance Ministry had requested, as leader of the Indonesian group, that payment of debts redeemable by the end of next year should be deferred. The delegates ended their confer- ence shortly before midnight and agreed on a moratorium, but not upon any period of deferment. Dis- agreements caused by each coun- try's different approach to defini- tions of cash trading, loans and short- and long-term credits pre- vented unanimous agreement, according -to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. Paris Meeting In his final address, Mr. Pande- laki referred to the decision by delegates to convene a creditor nations conference in Paris in December. There was more than a little bitterness in his remarks:- \" I need not mention, Mr. Chair- man, of the importance and expec- tations attached by the people and the Government of Indonesia to this meeting, and I can assure you that I will explain to them the re- sults of this conference to the best of my ability.\" he said, adding: we are certainly looking forward to the convening of the next meet- ing in which. we hope, tangible results could be achieved.\" The only solid achievement to come out of the conference to-day was an agreement in principle to a re-scheduling of payments already in arrears and those falling due in the period from July 1, 1966, to December 31, 1967, on \"certain categories of loans and export credits\" contracted before July 1, 1966. uring the Paris meeting, it was observed by several delegates to- day, agreement ls likely oh con- crete aspects of this deferment programme. The amount l te ived to be about S200m. of Indo- nesia's total *debts to non- Communist nations of S$,300m. Indonesia's total debts, including those to the Communist countries, amount to $2,6)a90m, Russia May Attend It was also decided that the Soviet Unon, aimr1. reditor of Indo- nesia, shoud be invated to atte tIN next Go n.eree.

IMF delegates to the conferenct to-day expressed, both in their reports and in the communique, their confi dence in the resilience of Indonesia'a economy and the ability of the Djakarta Government to rehabilitate the economy and to expand.normal trade on the current payments basi at an early date. In the communiqu, the IMF team presented a unified view that re-scheduling of Indonesian debts would be insufficient and that additional assistance will be required. It was revealed in the communiquE that \"certain countries\" at the con- ference recently agreed to extent additional emergency economic assist- ance to meet Indonesia's most urgent requirements in the next few months. Other nations' delegates indicated a readiness to make similar offers. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Office said to-night he thought this week's meeting of the \" %okyo Club' was a definite move toward the formation of a consortium in defence of Indonesia's economy. He pointed out -that Japan recently gave S30m. in emergency loans and aid. \"Not Enough Time\" Observers at the conference admitted to-night that although no tangible results were achieved, ground work for considerable pro- gress next time had been completed and that. In this sense, the confer- ence was successful. It was admitted by the Forei Office spokesman that \"not enough time and not enough information \" brought about condi. tions which were not suitable for bringing the various countries repreo sented together on specific debt re- scheduling programmes. Representatives from Britain; the United States, France, West Ger. many, Italy, Australia. the Nether. lands. Japan and the IMF attended to-day's meeting. Canada. New Zealand and Switzerland sent observers.",

But closures to be permitted will save Â£950,000, They include eight stations between Manchester Cen- tral and Sheffield Midland and 13 stations on the Buxton Midland-. Millers Dale Line.

   "text_content" : "The Lenoirs in Salacrou's htbc), or rather grey comedy (translated by Robin Rook from L'Archipel Lenoir) are a successful bourgeois family who live on the profits from their aperitif factory and on family pride. 73-year-old Paul-Albert, head of the clan, is charged 'with an indecent assault on a 17-year- old girl, and the family in conclave decide that the only decent way out of the trouble is for him to die. From there on the play follows a conventional course for this kind of farcical comedy, with naive mis- understandings and unexpected confrontations not to be disclosed, and a god from the machine (in this case the butler, Joseph) who clears everything up. M. Salacrou writes in this piece like a motorist driving with the handbrake on. His ideas are gay enough, and he has provided a stageful of useful characters, but his writing has a fatal lack of agility. When the unpredictable occurs, it is never unpredictable enough; and when he gives us a coup de thidMre he spreads it out so thinly that we are tired of it long before he lets it go. The play might seem livelier given a livelier performance. This one ig potentially lively but looks a if it could do with another week's rehearsal. M. Salacrou tends very often to have eight or nine people on stage at once, when it is vital for the cast to play to one another with nimble inter- action, and they don't seem able to do this yet. There are one or two telling performances, notably that of Richard Goolden as the bumbling, grumbling petulant old man, Valentine Dyall as a suave Rumanian prince related to the family by marriage, and Patricia lessel as a happy widow in touch with the dead; but the teamwork *on which the production so much depends is lacking.. The International Theatre Club, who are responsible for this pre- sentation, so often succeed in scor- ing a near-miss. They deserve our thanks for having given us Apol- linaire and Obaldia and .esage and now Salacrou; but if they had done them better how much more de- serving they would be. The current production, directed by George A. Foa and designed by John Canney (who had wise second thoughts in mid-evening .about his set) is the best thing they have done yet. I hope it presages well.",

   "text_content" : "This is a programme devised by James Roose-Evans to begin a \"Living Theatre Series,\" and designed and directed by him. It is a formidable evening. It begins with the presentation of a number of letters written by German soldiers at Stalingrad during its final days of resistance; and ends. by way of showing what a disaster actually feels like in action, with extracts from chil- dren's descriptions of the atomic destruction of Hiroshima, spoken above the searing dissonances of Penderecki's \"Threnody for Hiroshima.\" Additional pathos is given to the letters by the recollection that they were never delivered to their addresses. Instead, they were impounded and analysed by the German Bureau of Army Informa- tion in the hope that their publi- cation would in some way relieve the Supreme Command of blame for the fall of Paulus's 6th Army. But there was nothing in them to cheer the Supreme Command, and the letters were suppressed. Mr. Roose-Evans diversifies them in his presentation by having them read in character by a series of German soldiers, played 'by seven versatile actors. This gives them a dramatic quality they don't really possess; ideally they should be spoken in a hopeless monotone, I suppose, but this would never do in the theatre. Certainly Mr. Roose-Evans proves himself imag. inative and resourceful in the way he has grouped his figures around a central pyramidal dais to add a visual to the verbal dimension, and he has inserted German soldiers' songs from time to time to heighten the emotional effect. The effect is indeed desperately sad. The children's recollections of the Hiroshima outrage are far worse, but I couldn't help feeling that there was something forced about the deliberate playing on our feelings by combning the two items. Like the Fat Boy, Mr. Roose-Evans was determined to make our flesh creep. Well, he did mine; but the ques- tion that has to be asked is whether the programme as a whole achieves its object, the indictment of war as an act of human policy. Certainly it reminds us bow horrible the last war was; but I am doubtful whether dwelling on the horrors of the past is the best way to avoid further horrors in the future. B. A. Young.",

   "text_content" : "The second most popular piano concerto in the repertory and two justly popular artists who have made their home in England, the conductor Silvestri and the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy, between them filled the Festival Hall last night. It was the first of three concerts Silvestri is doing with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. They in- clude, on Thursday week, Mahler's Third Symphony. The combination evidently pro- duces good results. Silvestri favours a concentrated, closely blended tone range without much differen. tiation of timbre. There is much to be said for this at a time when virtuoso conductors tend to exag- gerate colour, but it was hard to get used to after some notable recent examples (entirely justified) of the opposite process, meaning the clear palettes of Boulez In Debussy, Webern, etc., and Horen- stein in Mahler. I must confess that owing to faulty time-keeping I missed the one work on the pro. gramme that might have given the lie to this opinion-Britten's Purcell Variations., The works which suggested It were Elgar's Enigma Variations and Rachmanlnov's C minor Con. certo. Some of the Variations were over-reticent and over. domesticated. This was probably true to life In Malvern in the 'nineties but was less than just to the purely musical values and particularly to Elgar's scoring. To say this is not to fall into the absurd error of thinking that only English conductors can give authentic performances of his music (if true, sadly damaging in its implications). There was much to enjoy in Silvestri's gentle handling and to admire in the energy he saved for the finale. One thing that was out of keep- ing was the inordinately fast tempo for \"Nimrod,\" not because it didn't sound, as so many English conductors make it, like an auxili- ary National Anthem, but because it didn't make musical sense and spoiled the contrast with the following Interpnezzo. Silvestri atoned for this lapse by most sensi- tive shaping of the last variation before the finale, with its haunting maritime quotation from Mendels- sohn. The LPO's tone suited Rach. maninov's furry doublings diabolic. ally well here prismatic colours would be as out of place as a draught in a boudoir. Strings, woodwind and brass made a soft, velvety cushion for Ashkenazy's mercurial playing, which ranged from a feathery ightness to a re.l- lient strength astonishing in so frail-looking a body, It was sur- prising-It always is-to be re- minded how much of this concerto is in fact fast, vivacious and even a pproaching a certain heotic gaiety. The moment the music stops, how- ever, the old impression of soggi- ness sets in aeain.",

   "text_content" : "p best .t wna of the weeL was undboutedly Christopher Burstall's hoosA (BBC-1)i an al4 too brief docutentary de- voted 4f H. . ils on the ceentenary of his bMttb It is.a sad commentary both on the taste of the average viewer and the Jack of courage of the BBC that whereas in the same week a film as sentimentally factitious as Sayonara can occupy two hours and 10 minutes of viewingtimne, this brilliant portrait ran for only 50 minutes. As a consequence, one felt that much had had to be either omitted altogether or drastically curtailed. Mme. Odette Keun, for example, appearing fitfully for a minute here and a minute there, like some bedraggled bird of paradise swoop- ing across the screen, deserved at least 10 minutes by herself to assemble her portrait of the Wells she had known in his later years. Whether castigating the critics crawling over the corpse of the dead man like so many Lilliputians over a dead Gulliver, or vehe- mently asserting that there were times when Wells could be a savage, she gave a superb per- formance. But what of Wells' equally gifted and voluble women friends, still alive? Presumably there had been no time for them. Or did Mr. Burstall shrink from any possible confrontation between them? Among others who took part were Wells' son, Professor G. P. Wells, who revealed that the one honour which his father had always coveted and never received was election to the Royal Society; Michael Foot, saying nothing of any importance with all the conviction and authority of a successful politician; and Frank Swinnerton, vigorously eupeptic though now in his eighties, to make the interesting point that the mere fact of being lectured on the novelist's art by men like James and Conrad, whom he recognised unwillingly as being greater artists than himself, had the effect on a man as obstinate as Wells of driv- ing him even further in the opposite direction from that in which they were trying to coax him. Two of the speakers found a wistful self-identification with Wells: John Braine who, like Wells, worked as a draper before he managed to escape from a lower middle-class background into a world of affluence; and an anonymous elderly man, a draper still, who spoke with both dignity and resignation of the escape denied him. The only defect of the pro- gramme was that the scenes from The Wheels of Chance (it was significant, incidentally, that Mr. Braine should think this first novel by Wells to be his best) came as flunsily, unreal intrusions into a narrative otherwise so authentic. As Jessie and Hoopdriver, such skilful performers as Sarah Miles and Murray Melvin appeared em- barrassingly simpering, coy and droll. Instead of these feeble ex- cerpts there were other facets of Sarah Miles and Murray Melvin in \"The Wheels of Chance\"- based on Wells' iaMt novel this astonishing man that might have merited a closer investiga- tion: his ability, for example, to charm a number of the outstand- ing women of his day even though his shhpe was that of a warden- pear and his voice that of a eunuch witti chronic catarrh. \"What a little bourgeois I What a little Philistine I\" remarked Lenin of him with complete accuracy. But he might also have added \" What a little genius !\" Of that genius this programme gave a convincing and discerning account. The same evening brought the first of a series of four interviews (BBC-2) with Glenn Gould, one of the most eccentric as well as one of the most gifted of contem-. porary pianists. Whether singing at the keyboard, refusing to shake hands for fear of damage to his fingers or quiarrelling with his con- ductors about the tempo to be adopted, he is the kind of player who is even more of a gift to the gossip-columnist than to the music-lover. For more than two years now he hat refused to appear in the concert-hall, not because, like Horowitz in the past, he shrinks from the nervous ordeal but because, as he trenchantly maintained when questioned by Humphrey Burton, he believes that the future of music lies in the re- enrdine stnrlin. With Stravinsky's complaint that the engineers nowadays replace the \" endearing \" errors and imbalances of the concert hall with \"a super- glossy chem-fab music substitute that was never heard on sea or land, including Philadelphia,\" Gould has no patience. Indeed, he even declared, in one of the more outrageous of his statements of faith, that soon every, man would become his own performer and conductor, manipulating his elec- tronic controls to impose his own interpretation on the raw-material of the recording before him or choosing between a dozen \"pos- sible\" readings of any passage of any given composition. To this Humphrey Burton, altogether too detached and mild for such con- troversy, interpolated mildly: \" But I don't want my Beethoven, I want Klemperer's.\" This first view of an exasperating, opinionated, voluble and obviously highly intelligent musician augurs well for the series. Jackanory,.a quarter of an hour of story-telling put out five after- noons a week. by the BBC, is one of the most consistently rewarding of children's programmes. Last week it was the turn of a Japanese girl, Setsuko Ito, to tell some Japanese fairy-tales with an appealingly diffident grace and charm. As it is told in Japan, the first of her stories concerns a fisherman who is given a box by the powers beneath the sea, with the instruction not to open it. Like Pandora, he dipobeys; he raises the lid, a puff of smoke escapes and at once he becomes an old man. What he has released is Time. In the version told by Miss Ito, he releases a butterfly, also representing Time, but he manages. to recapture it in one of his nets and thus remains youthful for- ever. Must one infer from this gentle bowdlerisation that English children are-considered less tough than Japanese ones? Two other Japanese women appeared with their English hus- bands in Late Night Line-Up (BBC-2) after the showing of Sayo- nara. Joan Bakewell is an attrac- tive, sympathetic and intelligent interviewer, but one felt, as so often in the case of this pro- gramme, that it requires almost as much knowledge to ask the right questions as to give the right answers. To ask: \" What has been the degree of westernisation in Japan in recent years?\" is the desperate expedient of someone not really familiar with the sub- ject under discussion; and inevit- ably an inquiry so general and others like it did not encourage two obviously nervous women to give of their best.",

   "text_content" : "Nineteenth-century Neo-Classi- cal sculpture has weathered even less well in the mind than in the bedraggled gardens where it has so long rested. Not even the. keen revival of interest in Vic- toriana and pre-Victoriana has yet cast a warm ray of interest upon those frigid maidens in marble, posing as Venus and Eve, nymphs startled, nymphs bathing, Innocence, Diana Musi. dora and God wot. Perhaps their dawn will break to-morrow when Christle's auc- tion 27, ol the Orittleton Marbles, originally assembled or commis- sioned by Joseph Neeld, MP for Chippenham, mostly during the second quarter of the 19th century for the Neo-Classical, Neo-Oothic, Neo-Romanesque manor which his own life-span proved too brief to complete. This ia not, it should be said, a particularly flattering anthology of early 19th-century Neo- Classicism, It could have been shown In a rather better light, The major fgures are absent: above all, the Italian Canova-a giant in hi day-and the Dane, Thorwald- sen, who was only a little less celebrated, Among British sculp. tors Chantrey is represented merely by single bust, of Neeld himself, and Olbson (Canova's pupil also by a single piece only, the Vmus lrloorda., a lesser- known variant of the \"Tinted Venus\" for Which he developed a Pygmalion-like passion, and which raised a few incredulous sniggers when it was ehibited a few years a|o at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Nine of the 27 sculp- tures, on the other hand, are by a minor academic whom Neeld chose to patronise. H.

   "text_content" : "By the tinm these notes appear Mers. Gorl Irish Yearillg Ses will be embarking on thir third and last day, ad breeder will have some indication as to how they are likely to fare at the October Sales that begin at New- market next Monday. Clearly the most important factor to be considered when assessing the prospects of vendors at this year's autumn sale of bloodstock is the extent to which the market will be affected by the tough measures introduced by the Government in order to bolster the national economy. There are, in fact, two schools of thought on this aspect. In other words, there are those who take the conven- tional view that, with money in short supply, there is bound to be a slump in prices, whereas others maintain that the bloodstock in- dustry has shown in the past that it is not influenced greatly by normal financial considerations. And this group points out that in 1957, when Bank. Rate stood at the then, unprecedented flgure of 7 per cent., and Wall Street, as to- day, was uncertain, the aggregate of money spent at the December Sales was a record. Again, in 1961, the September Sales of yearlings were conducted soon after another periodic in' crease of Bank Rate and against a background of international tension (the Russians had recently announced-their intention of renew- ing atomic bomb tests), in spite of which a new record was estab- lished. However, without wishing to be pessimistic, I am unable to visualise a sellers' market on this occasion. Indeed, it will be sur- prising if the overall figures at the two principal sales to be held by Messrs.. Tattersalls at the Park Paddocks. Newmarket, do not show a further substantial reduc- tion on last year's figures, which, in the case of the October Yearling Sales, were 24.4 per cent. below the previous year's average, and, in the case of the December Sales, 20 per cent. below the 1964 figure. The above ssessment is based on two separate premises. First, although the Government have intimated that the present harsh economic restrictions represent a short-term policy and that it ought to be possible to relax them in a matter of months, there is a strong body of opinion that believes that circumstances will not permit this happening, and that we are in for a long period during which bank managers, acting on instructions from \" Head Office,\" will not coun- tenance overdrafts, and certainly not for anything as speculative as the purchase of racehorses, which, if true, will have a serious effect on the market for yearlings. And, second, there is little doubt but that the market has for some Tod J-, C-l- - a ys eec time been affering from over production. In this last coantex an thritaR. tive writer, commenting on the poor results of lat year October Yearling Sales in the latest edition of the bloodstock Breeders' Re- view, pointed out that the quality of the lots offered had been deteriorating for some time, simply because their nutimbers had in- creased rapidly from 1960 on- wards. In 1965, for example, the number of lots listed in the cata- logue was 791, as against 684 in 1964 and 413 in 1960. \" Obviously,\" he goes on to say, \"the majority of yearlings offered by newcomers at the Sales are of lower (some times of much lower) quality than those presented by old customers. The fall in the average price . . . was inevitable, and one might only wonder that it came so late.\" The number of lots listed in the cata- logue for next week's Sales is 816. & The above assessment implies that over a period of seven or eight years, during which time prices of British bloodstock were constantly rising, too many people jumped on the band wagon, some of them I with limited knowledge of breeding * principles and with inadequate t capital to sustain the venture in 's the event of even a temporary recession in the market. And if, as seems probable, the market be- comes increasingly selective, with a reduced demand for animals of moderate class, many small com- mercial breeders will be obliged to i pull out of the game, since with costs of production becoming greater all the time they will have little hope of breaking even. Indeed, a study of the statistics of last year's Yearling Sales reveals ' that a substantial number of lots was sold for less, than the fee of the nomination to the covering stallion. As I see it, the pattern of the market at the forthcoming October Sales is clearly defined. There will, I think, be littk, IV any, falling off in the demand for yearlings bred on classic lines or for well-grown youngsters with top-class sprint pedigrees. These can be expected to fetch high prices, and many will no doubt be acquired, as in previous t years, by American buyers-some for export, others for racing, in this country or in Ireland. The t market for what is commonly des- i cribed as the \"bread-and-butter\" type of yearling, in other words, an animal by an unfashionable sire I out of a mare who may have won one or two small races, is likely to r be considerably weaker than it was I last year, and breeders who ob- tained, say, 700 gns.. or 800 gns. t for a well-grown yearling qs this description will be fortunate if they receive more than 500 gns. for an ! equivalent offering next week. otions-Page 18"
