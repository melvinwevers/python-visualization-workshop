FRIDAY Evening. There was a further easing of the position in the short loan and discount market to-day, but this was hardly sur- prising in view of the high level of banking deposits shown in the Bank Return and the activities of the banks towards bills. It was only to be ex- pected, therefore, that the Treasury bill tender should have been more favourable to the Government, despite the fact that Â£50,000,000 of bills were available. Applications for these totalled Â£60,160,000. The market syndicate raised its bid to Â£99 2s and, in the event, obtained a percentage quota of no less than 94 per cent., easily the largest for many months. All the available bills were allotted at an average rate of discount of Â£3 12s 0.98d per cent., as compared with Â£3 14s 3.48d per cent. last week. Tenders will be in- vited next Friday for Treasury bills to be allotted to the maximum amount of Â£55,000,000. October bills changed hands to-day at 2% per cent., November dates at 3 per cent. and the \" hot\" Treasury bills at 3% per cent. The competitive rate for three months fine bank drafts was no better than 3% per cent. Short loans were in ample supply, advances against bills being available at 3 per cent. LOAos Discou1T PER CE'T.

It is understood that only moderate offer- ings'of gold coin and bullion are being made. Silver prices were unchanged to- day at 215sd per ounce for both spot and forward delivery. Interest was at a low ebb and there was no special feature to report. The bullion market is closed to-morrow. Although the authorities again fixed the sterling-U.S. dollar rate at $4.02-$4.06, changes were made in other directions. The Canadian dollar, for example, appre- ciated to 4.37, while the Swedish and Nor- wegian kroner hardened to 16.93Y and 17.75'A respectively.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 8th Sept. A wave of buying, based partly on the move to hold a special session of Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, sent prices sharply upwards. Despite recurrent realising, the close was strong, with net gains extending to 4 points. Turnover totalled 3,510,000 shares, against 2,600,000 yesterday. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average rose 1.72 to 150.04, and Rails 0.98 to 30.40, but Utilities declined 0.13 to 23.85. Of 934 stocks dealt in, 611 ad- vanced, only 180 declined and 143 were unchanged. The market opened firm and active, and the advance gathered momentum in the morning, when the tape was two minutes late. The rise was resumed in the after- noon, despite flurries of profit-taking. Steels, Aircrafts and Motors were in the forefront of the advance. Chemicals were bought on reports of a rush of buying of the products in the past few days. Rails turned stronger on last week's freight car-loadings reaching a new high for the year. Merchandisings were helped by retail sales this week being estimated at 6 to 11 per cent. above a year ago. Coppers and Oils participated in the upturn. In the late trading a break in International Nickel upset the market, but renewed support resulted in a strong close. The Bond market was also higher, though U.S. Government issues were irregular. Sales totalled $19,070,000, against $23,550,000 yesterday. Sterling closed %c lower at $4.05%. Silver was unchanged at 36%c. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was to-day 167.7, against 169.1 yesterday. Steel export prices have risen sharply, and manufacturers are taking steps to prevent a runaway. United States Steel Corporation is opening coal mines which have been closed for years. The Eastern wholesale price of petrol has been raised %c a gallon. Loans to brokers and dealers increased $32,000,000 in the week to 6th September to $499,000,000. Other loans for carrying securities decreased $7,000,000 to $176,000,000. Collateral loans held by New York Stock Exchange member firms on 31st August totalled $508,600,000, compared with $533,800,000 on 31st July. Call loans were $478,100,000 (against $526,700,000) and time loans $30,500,000 ($27,100,000). The Bureau of Labour's wholesale price index for the week to 2nd September was 75.3 (1926=100), against 74.8 for the previous week and 77.8 a year ago.",

   "text_content" : "The decision to close the Stock Ex- change from Monday onwards at 2 p.m. was generally welcomed. Business yesterday was again largely directed to clearing up pre-war positions; these the Committee desires shall be closed as far as possible in good time for the 21st September Settlement. Further good progress was made towards regularising dealings on the \"cash only\" system now obligatory for new bargains. Certificates with Orders For smooth, working of cash deal- ings it is urgent that sellers should send certificates with their oraers and let brokers have signed transfers by return of post. Even so, it is likely to take at least five working days to have certified transfers ready for delivery. In the interim it would not be reasonable as things now are for clients to expect payment from their brokers unless specifically arranged. The Committee's recommendation for future settlements of \"cash differ- ences \" is as between members and does not directly concern the public. Transfer Facilities The Bank of England's decision to certify transfers at its Finsbury Circus branch will greatly facilitate the working of the emergency legisla- tion by which \"inscribed stock\" is now being transferred by deed. A facility which arbitrageurs with the dominions would like to see gener- ally accorded is that by which many companies transfer shares from English into overseas names on receipt of telegraphic instructions from their London offices. A good many shares were sold to Australia yesterday and if all these can be transferred by cable it will save much expense and probable delay in shipment. It is customary to insure the full value of securities sent overseas to save the considerable time and ex- pense which would be involved in replacing any lost certificates. Eight-Guinea Gold Gold ..at 168s an ounce. and the sovereign at 39s 3d are both worth almost twice, their pre-1931 par. In the first half of this year the metal averaged about 148s 6d and in 1938 only about 142s 6d. Yet there has been no rush in the past two days to buy Gold shares. It is not only technical market handicaps which are causing a postponement of purchases. New buyers of equities will seek for prospective yields considerably higher than demanded in recent years. They will try to provide in advance for the probability of increased taxation and a gradual rise in the cost of living. Holders of shares in Mining-as well as Oil, Rubber and Tea-com- panies throughout the Empire will, 1 imagine, soon have to resign them- selves to the withdrawal of dominion tax relief, anyway \" for the duration.\" Hitherto a rebate of up to half (at present 2s 9d) of U.K. income-tax has been accorded to holders in this coun- try of South African and most other dominion shares.

   "text_content" : "FRIDAY Evening. To-day's Stock Exchange businesi was obviously under week-end in. fluences. Total attendance was notic ably less and activity showed little expansion. Prices were irregular, but the undertone remained steady. Markets showed no sign of broadening, and dealing was as difficult as ever. Man3 price changes gave an exaggerated im pression of the volume of business. The number of bargains marked ir all markets was 1,907, compared witl 1,768 yesterday. An early improvement in gilt-edgec stocks was not maintained. Possi. bilities of increased taxation in an emergency Budget were put forward as a likely cause of the reaction. Consols 2% per cent. rose to 62% against a fixed minimum price of 62, bul were rather dull at that figure at the close Transactions were recorded up to 63%. Iocal Loans were as high as 73% tem porarily, but finished % down on balanc, at their minimum of 73%. War Loan wa! \"marked \" only a few times between 88% and 88%, while among short-dated securi ties Conversion 4% per cents, eased te their fixed price of 100%. The only movement among India stocks was a rise of % in the 2% per cents. t( 55%. Dealings in other issues were at oi near the minima. Gilt-edged prices Page 4 CHILEAN SIXES RISE Turnover in the Foreign market wa. said to have been very much on yester. day's scale. A feature was the deman( for certain South and Central Americar bonds, evidently inspired by possibilities of improvement in economic conditions a. a result of war in Europe. Colombia Sixes rose 4% to 27% ani Costa Rica Fives 3% further to 22%. Ar improvement in Chilean Sixes to 12 wai attributed to purchases of the sterlinj issues against sales of the higher-price( dollar bonds. Central European loans remained weak with no sign of further bear closing it Germans. The 5 per cents, lost 2 al 13 and the 4% per cents, a point at 8 Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 ARGENTINE RAILS WANTED The Home Rails market passed an idle day, with public interest at a very low level. Ordinary stocks were steady at the lower prices ruling after yesterday's falls and all prices were unchanged. Prior charges remained at the unofficial minims fixed at the beginning of the week. In the Foreign Rails list the Argentine issues again attracted some demand, B.A.G.S. Ordinary added % to 6% and B.A, Western advanced % to close at 6. Canadian Pacifies were again adjusted towards the Wall Street quotation. The final quotation was 1% up at 6. Indian Railways continued their process of adjust- ment to the lower gilt-edge prices. Assam Bengal dropped 1 point to 61% Few American Railways were mentioned in London Stock Exchange dealings, but such as were showed a rising tendency. New York Central closed a full point higher at 18% and Pennsylvania added Y to 23. Home and Overseas Rail prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS QUIETER Tobaccos Affected by Fears of New Taxation Conditions in the Industrial market varied and some of the leaders finished dull. The prospect of a supplementary Budget and fresh taxation was a restraining factor upon demand and had a modifying effect upon the recent optimism. Shipping shares gave a fresh display of strength, helped by country buying, and influenced also by talk of higher freight rates. The narket, however, had an easier appear- ance at the close. The general turnover was smaller and the trend in some direc- tions became easier as the day advanced. Comparatively, little business was done in BANKING shares, the tone of which was lull. Midland Bank Â£2 10s part paid were down % to 8% and the fully paid % to 9. Barclays \"A\" were X easier at 9%. In Overseas issues, National of India closed 1% lower at 27. INSURANCE shares were ower in a few instances, Prudential \"A\" being 1 down at 28%. Feature among ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT and kindred shares was the renewed buy- ng of Ever Readys on the increasing use of the company's products; the shares closed 2s 3d higher at 22s 9d. A small business passed in General Electrics up to 74s 6d. Transactions among MOTORS were light and as they mainly represented selling orders the tendency was easier. Thomas Tillings finished is 3d down at 40s, hav- ing changed down to 38s 6d during the day. Albions were lowered Is 10%d to 45s 7%d. In AIRCRAFT, Bristols were weak on moderate selling and closed s 10%d lower at 13s 9d. Dealings in SHIPPING descriptions were imited by the scarcity of stock in some nstances, but a fair turnover passed in P. and O. Deferred, which left off at '2s 6d, after changing at 24s. France 'enwicks advanced 2s to 24s 6d. Elder Dempster Holdings were rather buyers at 25s. Cunards were in request and the country at one time was bidding 4s 3d for the shares; they left off 2s 3d higher at 4s 6d. Although the turnover in ARMAMENT and Telogoredjo finished 9d dearer at 15s 3d. On the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange Rubber shares were also in good inquiry, with sellers reserved. Some of the leaders were a trifle easier, Rubber Trust being 27s 6d and Anglo-Dutch 25s. Malayalam were wanted at around 29s. The spot quotation for raw rubber fluctuated throughout the day. Opening unchanged at 9%d per pound, the price eased to 9%d. Final rates were as fol- lows: Spot, September and October 9%d, October-December 9%d, January-March 9%d, April-June 9%d. Tea shares received only a very small amount of attention. Dooars receded from 30s to 27s 6d. Chulsa at 1i/', Empire of India 21s 3d, Jorehaut 28s 9d, Travan- core 27s 6d were all Is 3d cheaper. Similar conditions existed in Mincing Lane. Rubber and Tea share prices Page 4 RHODESIAN COPPERS STRONG Rhokanas at Highest Since 1937 Rhodesian Coppers attracted most attention in Mines. Some demand was inspired by the view that a maximum out- put from Rhodesia will be necessary to satisfy the war-time copper demands of the Empire. This, it was averred, would prove much more important a factor than the handicap of a maximum copper price. Rhokana closed Â£1 up at 13%, the highest price since 1937, Rhodesian Anglo American Is 3d up at 25s 6d, and Roan Is to the good at 18s 3d. Selection Trust and Rhodesian Selection improved by smaller amounts. Among Tins, one two Malayans ad- vanced, including Tronoh, up %/, at X, Pahang Is higher at 12s 6d and S. Kinta 9d better at 11s 9d There was a rela- tively big inquiry for Cornish issues. South Crofty were a feature with a jump of Is 6d to 9s 6d on the news mentioned here this morning that the labour strike has been terminated. Elsewhere, a good turnover was re- ported in Mawchi, which held at 1%.. Of the Finance issues, British Tin gained 9d to 12s 9d and Londons 4%d to 3s 6d. A fair amount of business \"in the circumstances\" took place in Lead-Zincs. Zinc Corporation rose % to 3% and New Broken Hill 3d to 12s 6d. Kaffirs remained quiet. Venterspost weakened %. to 1%, Rand Leases and Daggafontein. Crown were called % higher at 16 and Sub Nigel / up at 10%. Brakpan at 2'%., Springs at 1%. and City Deep at 21/. improved %. apiece. Small selling to clear up open positions depressed West Africans. Ashanti weakened 'o to 3%. Bibiani declined Is to 26s despite the good August profit. Mining share prices Page 4 and STEEL shares was very light the tone was good and an improving tendency shown in some directions. Dealers were inclined to quote wide prices again, the widths in some of the popular issues being Is and 2s. John Browns, in a rise of Is 3d to 28s 3d, reflected a little support. Colvilles and Guest Keens were up 6d each. Lautaro Nitrates, on the demand for nitrate, advanced Is l1d to 3s 9d and Imperial Chemicals were 9d higher at 31s. British Oxygens and Turner and Newalls were each Is 3d lower. Building shares were fairly steady. In the TEXTILE section some of the low- priced issues were in good request. Calico Printers Ordinary at 4s 6d and Bradford Dyers at 4s were each 9d better. RAYONS were dull, with Courtaulds finally 9d down at 29s 3d. The STORES group was dull. Woolworths closed 3s lower at 60s, while Marks and Spencers eased %, to 21%.. Jones and Higgins were lowered % to 1% on the passing of the interim. Fears of new taxation imparted a reactionary tendency to TOBACCO and BREWERY shares. Imperial Tobaccos were %s lower at 6% and British-Americans Ys easier at 4'/,n. Actual changes among Brewery shares were few. A fair amount of business was trans- acted in American Industrials and in some instances prices showed an improving tendency. Industrial prices Page 4 SMALL BARGAINS IN OILS Bargains in OIL shares reached a quite respectable total, but the individual trans- actions were in all cases small. Shells met with a moderate demand and a small turnover between 86s 3d and 89s 0%d left them Is 3d higher at 88s 9d. Royal Dutch also were wanted and marked between 38% and 39% before closing firm at 39. Shell Unions enjoyed fair activity, closing a point higher at 16%. Burmahs moved up %. to 3S';, business taking place between 3. , and 3'/^, while Anglo-Iranians were firm at 3'%2 after changing between 3''.', and 3%. A few of the Trinidad issues received a little attention and Leaseholds gained %1 to 4%, as a result of dealings between 4%, and 4\",:,,. Trinidad Petroleum Deve- lopments were firmer at 2%. Oil Prices Page 4 RUBBERS QUIET Another quiet day was witnessed in the market in Rubber shares, but prices were generally firmer. A good many price inquiries were received mainly from buyers, and, in the absence of stock in any great quantity, many quotations advanced. United Sua Betong eased 6d to 48s 3d, and Anglo-Dutch left off Is 3d lower at 25s. Rubber Trust remained firm at 27s 6d. Highlands changed hands occasionally and put on Is 7%d at 22s 3d, Zinc Corporation rose ,a to SY, and New Broken Hill 3d to 12s 6d. Kaffirs remained qit etrps weakened %. to 1%, Rad Letrsoteases and Daffgafontein. Crown were called Y2 higher at 16 and Sub Nigel Y8 up at 10%.: Brakpan at 2'Vie. Springs at 1%. and City Deep at 21/1. improved I/, apiece. Small selling to clear up open positions depressed West As ricans. Ashanti veakened Ma to 3%. Bibiani declined 19 to 26s despite the good August profit. Mining share prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange business on a cash basis, as now conducted, means that the small speculator is out of action, unless he is prepared to make imme- diate payment for his purchases. Even so, his activities are limited to the ex- tent of his cash resources. The effect of the new order has been to reveal an inadequate supply of the shares which have come into demand in the last day or two and dealing accordingly has become a matter for negotiation. Jobbers dare not go short of stock under the new conditions. Sellers have been slow in coming forward so that it has become almost impossible to buy any fair quantity of promising shares, other than Imperial Chemicals, Turner and Newall, Cour- taulds, British American Tobacco, Im- perial Tobacco and a few more. Usually the floating supply of such shares is fairly constant and if a dealer does sell short he should not have long to wait for sellers to come forward. In some cases, brokers have entered into a \"gentleman's agree- ment\" not to demand immediate de- livery where there is a reasonable hope of obtaining stock soon. Shipping Activity The revival in Shipping shares is in full swing. It has materialised earlier than the market had expected and probably is due to the news that the convoy system is to be adopted for merchantmen as soon as possible. A fortnight ago it was suggested that should a period of prosperity arise some of the cheap Shipping shares might easily double in price. Actually this has happened. Cunards, then 2s. are now 4s 6d. In other instances, Cairn Lines within the fort- night have risen from 3s 3d to 5s, Lamport Lines from 5s to 8s, and Coast Lines from 8s 6d to 11s. In a way, some of the present-day prices are artificial-at least, certain market circles regard them in that light. A demand there has been, but it has not been heavy enough in itself to lift market values to the present level. Nor has there been an improve- ment in the earning power of the \"tramp \" companies to justify a strong buying movement. Shares in Short Supply The technical position of the market to an extent explains the movement in Shipping shares. These have been in short supply, for holders have been reluctant to sell at recent low prices. Quotations have been marked up gradually to satisfy a moderate specu- lative demand. Should sellers come forward, we may see some sharp reactions. And, as ex- perience shows, a downward movement frequently brings in further sellers. In the present circumstances caution is advisable, for while the freight out- look is more hopeful, investors, when the present demand is satisfied, may modify their optimism until it is seen how the war progresses.

   "text_content" : "The Boards of industrial concerns must be under considerable tempta tion in present circumstances to delay or pass dividend payments. It is only natural, when the nation is adjusting its economy to a war basis and when it is evident that there must be vast changes in the earning power and activity of various industries, that there should be a tendency to conserve working capital. It is not difficult to sympathise with those responsible for the direction of a company's affairs who are inclined to pursue a policy of ca'canny until the future shape of our economic life becomes a trifle clearer. At the same time it is essential that the economic machine should not be retarded for want of fuel. And one of the most important constituents of its fuel is the dividend flow. The Government's economic policy at the present time may be said to have two general objectives. The first is external-the mobilisation of our foreign exchange resources, the assur- ance of food and raw material supplies and the like. The second, no less im- portant, is the maintenance of flexible internal financial conditions, with an eye to the vast loan operations which must soon become necessary. The control of investment and the strenuous efforts which the Stock Exchange is making to adjust itself to the new con- ditions are both examples of economic defensive work on the home front. By making the most generous dividend payments which are compatible with their current financial positions and future trading probabilities industrial concerns can make an all-important contribution to the smooth functioning of the nation's economy in war-time. Only thus can an important part of the national savings be made available for the prosecution of the war. There are many circumstances, of course, in which a conservative divi- dend policy would be fully justified, and, indeed, inevitable. Certain busi- nesses will be hard put to it to survive. On the other hand, many concerns are likely to enjoy considerable expansion, and must ensure that their growth will not be hindered by lack of working capital. The cost of air raid precau- tions is a substantial burden in innumerable cases, and the possibility of damage from the air is a very real factor to be borne in mind in certain instances. In this latter connection it should be repeated that the early introduction of an official property war risk insurance scheme, providing for some immediate payment on account of damage suffered, is very desirable. All these factors must be weighed up by individual Boards. So far, it should be said in all fairness, there has been little sign that those who have the decision in these matters are blind to the broader considerations of national economic wellbeing.",

   "text_content" : "No very clear picture of the outlook for Richard Thomas and Co. was obtained from Sir William Firth's ad- dress at the meeting yesterday. That is hardly surprising considering how wartime conditions must prevent any- thing like definite prognostications. But neither, it would appear, can the near position be regarded with opti- mism, although it is improved com- pared with the past year when demand was sub-normal and prices and profit margins lower. Then operations only approximated 25 per cent. of the total plant now owned and only 50 per cent. of the original plant. Further assets representing not more than half of the total capital in the business were profit earning, apart from the fact that heavy running-in losses were incurred by new plant at Ebbw Vale. The net amount of Â£267,400 by which the general reserve has been depleted, largely to cover the propor- tion of debenture interest attributable to the cost of reconstruction at Ebbw Vale and Redbourn, will have to be re- stored out of future profits. On the basis of earnings in recent months it is estimated that net profits for the cur- rent year will substantially exceed that amount and the agreed annual transfer of Â£100,000 to reserve, as well as a total charge of Â£650,000 for de- preciation. Sir William disposed of the idea that the Control Committee attempts to interfere with the day-to- day management of the business. The influence of the Committee and the Iron and Steel Federation is welcomed because under normal conditions it can prevent the danger of excess modern plant in the industry.",

   "text_content" : "Now that the full accounts of Leeds Fireclay are available it would appear that motives of prudence dictated the decision to pay only 5 per cent., against 7 per cent., on the Six per Cent. Non-Cumulative Participating Prefer- ence shares and nothing on the Ordi- nary. Trading profit was roughly Â£20,000 down, but owing to some re- duction in the amount applied to re- pairs and depreciation the net profit was only Â£15,500 lower at Â£43,300. A year ago the Ordinary shares had 5 per cent., and a sum of Â£10,000 was put to dividend equalisation account. Quite apart from this fund, which now amounts to Â£20,000, the available balance of Â£50,500 after payment of the Preference dividend would have been amply sufficient for a payment on the Ordinary, as the distribution a year ago absorbed only Â£5,000. No doubt in view of the war situa- tion it has been decided to carry for- ward the whole balance of Â£50,500, which compares with Â£32,200 a year ago. No evidence of a serious decline in turnover is afforded by the balance- sheet, which shows stocks Â£3,000 higher at Â£93,500 and debtors Â£1,000 more at Â£88,800. A drop of Â£27,300 in cash to Â£43,900 partly accounts for an increase of Â£35,800 to Â£598,500 in in- vestments, both in subsidiaries and other securities.",

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Coming events had rather cast their shadows before in Lombard Street. The Bank of England statement, as explained in these notes, had revealed an extraordinarily large increase in bankers' balances,' while the clearing banks have been making loans much more freely, as well as buying bills, even to the extent of acquiring \"hot\" Treasurys. Rates for short-dated paper had already begun to give way, so there was no great surprise at the fall in the tender average to Â£3 12s 0.98d per cent. The larger amount of Â£50,000,000 of bills was available, but in the circumstances mentioned above the market was more than satisfied with the result of its efforts. The syndi- cate practically had the field to itself, as is evidenced by the fact that the quota was 94 per cent. If this is not a record figure it is the highest for many moons. In view of the larger volume of bills to be taken up during next week and the announcement of an offer of Â£55,000,000 next Friday-the biggest offering since as far back as 2nd December, 1932-there is a possibility that the decline in discounts may be arrested. Improving Slowly The foreign exchange market ad- vanced a little-but only a little-- yesterday towards what we must expect to be war-time normality. Part of the tangled skein created by the new forms and regulations was unravelled, but many problems still remain unsolved. It is interesting to note that two more prominent firms have been taken under the segis of the Bank of England, making three which have been called in to render assistance. The official appellation for these concerns is Bank of England, Foreign Exchange Control, Sub-sections 1, 2, 3. It is thought that one or two other firms will be taken on in a similar capacity. The arrangement is only temporary, as far as is at present intended, but it is satisfactory that some advantage has been taken of the foreign exchange brokers' organisation. Meantime, some at least of the authorised dealers appear to be using their own discretion in regard to certain problems.",

The final dividend of 25 per cent. is to be repeated, making 40 per cent. again for the twelve months Early in August the market was in clined to hope for some increase There will be no surprise now that the advance has failed to materialise, not- withstanding that the expectation of higher earnings proves justified. Net profit comes out Â£12,400 higher at Â£226,500. This includes Â£3,100 against Â£1,400, from miscellaneous items, but Â£2,600 more at Â£17,900 ha: been provided for depreciation. Taxa- tion reserve again takes Â£35,000, and the surplus of Â£11,700 is used to raise the carry-forward to Â£32,600. How far rearmament has increased the demand for duplicating machines it is impos sible to say, but the outcome certainly is very satisfactory. It has still to be revealed whether the full year, like its first half, set up new records.",

   "text_content" : "A sharp fall in earnings is reported by Prices Tailors. The rise of this undertaking, based on the success of Fifty Shilling Tailoring, has been one of the star turns of the industry. For the year ended June, 1938, profits established a fresh high record of Â£572,600, but for the past twelve months the amount falls Â£120,000 short of that figure. The total of Â£452,000 is struck before charging Â£60,000 for income-tax and N.D.C., set- ting aside Â£90,000 for tax reserve and allowing Â£96,000 for depreciation. The outbreak of war makes the outlook still more obscure and justifies the caution displayed in distributing profits, although this is detrimental at present to shareholders of Prices Trust Company, which owns all the Ordinary capital. The Trust is de- ferring its final dividend, so that until a further decision is reached the in- terim of 121 per cent. stands as the only payment for the past year.

   "text_content" : "Announcement of a second quar- terly interim dividend of 5 per cent. by Reckitt and Sons may be taken to indicate that the normal procedure in operation before the merger with J. and J. Colman is being continued. For 1938, which was the first account- ing period giving effect to the change, Reckitt and Sons kept up an eight year record with three interim payments of 5 per cent. each, a final of 61 per cent. and a bonus of 14 per cent., making 224 per cent. for each year. On the basis of a price of 107s 6d for the Â£1 units the yield is just over 4 per cent. The company owns approxi- mately 65 per cent. of the capital of the new private company, Reckitt and Colman, which was formed just over a year ago to acquire the trading assets of the two operating concerns. Shares in subsidiary companies stood in the last balance-sheet at a value of Â£6,182,000, of which the interest in Reckitt and Colman represented Â£5,525,700 at cost.

Telegrams: \" Finantno, dAe., London.\" AP.-You have overlooked that in issue in which parity of New York Centrals was shown as 2013ls, the London quotation under heading of American Rails was shown on Page 4 Column 2 as 16-17. As explained at some length in issue of 7th September divergence between London and New York quotations is due partly to regu- lations in regard to foreign currency securities, cabling difficulties, and high in- surance rates and other matters. We refer you to the article on Page 2 of that issue. Eastfleld-Company has no interests in enemy countries, so far as is known, and hostili- ties should not delay publication of the accounts. They are not due until October. J. B. H.-Current market prices are given in this issue under the heading of Banks. You cannot expect to obtain the shares under the ruling price. Fair buying prices would be 61 for No. 1 and 5k for No. 2. Seymour-There have been inquiries for Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the last two days and prices should improve in time. 4. Rather a lock-up until details of the arrangement with Government are available. 5. Courtaulds are promising, but reversion to cash deal- ings tends to restrict interest in the shares. Nos. 6, 7 and 8 are lock-ups until markets are more active. Sussex-Forms are obtainable at the Bank of England. Your bank or broker would effect the registration for you. Both U.S. Steel and International Nickel should be registered. You can sell either whenever they are registered. We do not advise sell. ing yet simply to transfer to that Prefer- ence stock, which may be obtainable cheaper by waiting. Wallflower-1. It is not possible to say how company will fare under war conditions, but shares are a good Industrial, and as you are not in need of the money you should hold for the present. 2. Rather speculative. There are no buyers for the shares, and you would have difficulty in selling just now, except at a sacrifice. W. B. S.-The Cam and Motor return appeared in Wednesday's issue and that of Bushtick on Thursday. Other Rhodesian mining profits will be published as avail. able and when space permits.",

   "text_content" : "Commencing on Monday next, the Stock Exchange will be closed at 2 p.m. daily. The House closing time will thus synchro- nise with that of the banks. In present conditions all the business available can be dealt with before 2 p.m. The earlier closing will enable members and staffs to deal with necessary office work after the end of official hours and per- mit them to arrive home before the black-out. In normal times the closing hour of the House is 4 p.m., but for the past two days the doors have been shut at 3 p.m. An event of outstanding importance to the rubber market was the decision to raise the quota for the fourth quarter by 10 per cent. to 70 per cent. to permit the British Government to carry out its barter deal with the United States. Business in all sections of the Stock Exchange yesterday showed no expan- sion and prices were still in process of adjustment to war conditions. Quota- tions were irregular, but the undertone was steady. Shipping shares were strong at the opening, but lost part of their rise in the afternoon. Good rises in Rhodesian Copper shares were a feature in the Mining market. BREWERIES AND TOBACCOS Down on Tax Fears Fears of an increase in taxation in the emergency Budget which the Chancellor will shortly introduce was reflected in Brewery and Tobacco company shares on the Stock Exchange yesterday. The volume of business in brewery des- criptions was not sufficient thoroughly to test prices, but Bass, which had lost %,2 on the previous day, were again lower and at 5% showed a decline of 'n. Guinness units were again % down at 4'i,. There was some selling of Tobacco shares which resulted in a number of declines in prices. British-American Regis- tered units at 4'/' lost Â¼, while Carreras \"A\" were lower a like amount to 6. The \" B\" shares of 2s 6d denomination were down 6d at 14s 6d. There was a fall of :' in Imperials to 6%. Closing Prices Page Four CASH DIFFERENCES Contangoes & Rates The Stock Exchange Committee recom- mends that differences in connection with cash bargains should be settled on 21st September in respect of business trans- acted up to 15th September inclusive. Thereafter, cash differences should be settled on 1st November in respect of busi- ness transacted up to 25th October in- clusive-that is, five working days previous to 1st November. Subsequently, cash differences should be settled on a similar basis-that is, on the first working day of the month in respect of business transacted up to the fifth previous work- ing day. Notwithstanding the postponement of the 7th September Settlement, the Com- mittee trusts that members will make every endeavour to settle outstanding bargains as soon as possible. In the event of members wishing to arrange the further continuation of existing con- tangoes, they are asked to do so between now and 12th September in order that clearing lists may be sent in to the depart- ment by 2.30 p.m., on 13th September. Contango rates for the extended period of 7th to 21st September must not exceed 2 per cent. above the rate at which securities concerned were carried over from 24th August to 7th September.",

The Department of Agriculture's second estimate of this season's cotton crop is 12,380,000 bales as at 1st Septem- ber, compared with 11,412.000 forecast a month ago, or a jump of 968,000 bales. The final figure for 1938-39 was 11,943,000 bales. Average condition is now put at 70 per cent. of normal, against 74 on 1st August and the final 1938-39 figure of 65. Yield per acre is estimated at 244.7 lbs, against 223.7 and 235.8 respectively. Ginnings up to 1st September totalled 1,401,756, com- pared with 1,335,643 to the same date last year. GILT-EDGED TRANSFERS The Bank of England is reopening at its Threadneedle Street premises a small sec- tion for certifying transfers, out of jobbers' names only, in British Govern- ment and India stocks. Subject to differences in banking hours the opening of this office should restore the position of Stock Exchange jobbers to that prior to the removal out of Lon- don of the Bank's Stock Transfer Depart- ment.

AUSTRALIAN BUDGET Expenditure estimated at Â£101,916,000 -a record-is provided for in the Aus- tralian Budget for 1939-40. As a result of war it will have to be increased by supplementary estimates. Estimated revenue on present rates of taxation is Â£96,030,000. The shortage is to be met by additional taxation, yielding Â£2,360,000 in the case of income-tax, Â£1,420,000 sales tax and Â£2,130,000 Customs and Excise, giving an estimated surplus of Â£24,000.

The quota for October, November and December was fixed at 60 per cent. on 25th July when it was raised by 5 per cent., the increase also applying to the third quarter. The Ministry of Supply also announced yesterday that the market office to be set up through which the Government will buy through the trade the rubber needed for delivery to the United States will be opened on Monday next. The office will be at Plantation House, Mincing-lane, E.C., and full particulars of the buying pro- cedure will be given in a notice which is being issued to the trade immediately. The Ministry will regulate its buying programme in accordance with con- ditions ruling in the market from time to time. The opening of the market office does not necessarily imply that purchases will be made forthwith. The price of rubber declined yesterday by %d to 9>d per pound.",

   "text_content" : "The ninetieth annual general meeting of Richard Thomas and Co:, Ltd., was held yesterday at Southern House, Cannon. street, E.C. SIR WILLIAM FIRTH (chairman of the company) presided. The Joint Secretary (Mr. T. Griffiths) read the notice convening the meeting and Sir Harold Howitt read the report of Messrs. Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co., the auditors. The Chairman said: It was decided to postpone the annual general meeting until after the August holidays, when it was found impossible to hold it at the usual time, owing to various changes then pend ing in the composition of the Board, These changes have since been announced in the Press and I should like to make a few observations in regard to them. The responsibility for the appointment of the Board rests, as you know, for the time being, with the committee of control of which Iam happy to be a member. The committee has also considered it to be its duty to give close attention to the question of the higher personnel of the company realising that management is more than ever of importance since the erection of the new plant at Ebbw Vale. MANAGING DIRECTORSHIP So great, and varied are the problems before us that it is essential if matters of policy are to receive due deliberation that I should be afforded some relief in the task of conducting the company's affairs. It has therefore been decided that a full time Chairman as well as a managing director should be appointed. I have as you already know relinquished the managing directorship, and for the present Mr. James, your deputy-chairman, in whom I have found a valued and ex- perienced colleague, has agreed to take over that position-for this step he has received the kind permission of his col- leagues on the Board of the Lancashire Steel Corporation. It had been intended to announce the change in the managing directorship at the general meeting, but when unfor- tunately it became necessary to accept the resignation of Sir Charles Wright and Mr. Beale, it was decided with Mr. James' per- mission, to make and to announce the new appointment at once. During the association of Sir Charles Wright and Mr. Beale with the company we have obtained the agreement of the tinplate industry to satisfactory quota arrangements for the manufacture of tin- plates at Ebbw Vale. CO-OPERATION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY In dealing with the many problems which still are before us, and in the other trades with which we are associated, it is as necessary and desirable as before to develop a policy of co-operation with the rest of the dustry and the wide experi- ence and counsel of the new directors will be of great value in all these matters. On your behalf I extend a warm wel- come to the Earl of Dudley, who unfortun- ately is unable to be present to-day, to Sir James Lithgow, and to Mr. A. C. Mac- diarmid, all of them persons eminent in the steel trade. At a later date the company will announce the appointment of a whole-time finance director to take the place of Mr. John Adamson, whose resignation from the Board was recently announced. With your permission I propose to take the directors' report as read and to con- fine my comments to such items as seem to me to be of major importance. I shall deal as usual with the group figures and not the separate figures of the parent company. PROBLEMS OF PAST YEAR The year under review has been a dis- appointing one to our shareholders, as, indeed, it has been an anxious one for your directors, who were confronted with three problems:- (a) The liquidation of surplus stocks accumulated as an insurance against the risk of war. (b) A demand for both sheets and tin- plates much below the average of recent years. (c) Supervision of the completion of the development work at Irthlingborough ore fields, the completion of the Ebbw Vale plant and the training of the work- people and the running in of the plant there. SLiquidation of our stock of ingots and pig-iron increased our percentage of idle- ness and decreased our gross earnings, which, after taking care of Ebbw Vale losses and running-in expenses and trans- ferring an amount from the special reserve for contingencies sufficient to meet losses on stocks and forward contracts, etc., fell to Â£888,880, representing a reduction as compared with the previous year, of Â£1,251,137. The comparison, however, is a little misleading because neither year was normal. The previous year was a period of excep- tionally good demand, while the year under review was a period of sub-normal demand, lower prices and lower profit margins. Sight should not be lost of the fact that operations only approximated 25 per cent. or the total plant we now own and only 50 per cent. of our original plant. The gross profits, disappointing as they are, were earned by assets representing not more than 50 per cent. of the total capital in the business and the balance of the capital not only contributed nothing to the profit picture but incurred heavy starting- up and running-in losses. THREE YEARS' COMPARISON Despite the disappointing result it is not without interest to note that the profits for the three years ending March last, after taking care of these heavy starting extraordinary and capital expenditure written off, and excluding credits ex- traneous to the period, totalled Â£4,469,197, out of which Â£1,200.000 has been set aside for depreciation. These figures compare with the prospectus profit estimate for the three years of Â£4,750,000 and a deprecia- tion allocation of Â£1,050,000. If it is realised that the prospectus estimate of profits did not take into account the nine to twelve months' delay in the delivery of machinery by contrac- tors, but did take into account a contribu- tion from the new plant which did not mature, it will be recognised that the actual profits earned during the three years falling short of prospectus estimate by only Â£281,000 was not altogether an unsatisfactory performance. In making this three years' comparison I ar: of course not overlooking the fact that the prospectus trend was upwards over the period, a result which has been spoiled b! delays and circumstances beyond ou control. LOWER COSTS OF NEW PLANT it may be thought that in view of the poor demand experienced during the yea under review even if the new plant ha< been ready at contracted dates the tota profits for the three years would still have fallen short of the estimate; this, however vould be incorrect because since the clos< of the year under review it has beer proved that the new works are capable o: producing at a cost substantially lowe: han it is possible to attain in old typi plant and the product produced is vastl_ superior. (Hear, hear.) The profits of the previous year woulc have carried the cost of training the mei and starting up, but the profits of the yeai under review would have benefitet hrough the lower Ebbw Vale productior cast and the greater volume of business resulting from our ability to supplh superior qualities which vould have ii creased the demand for our products anm I have no hesitation in claiming that oui :ross profits would then have exceeded th. prospectus estimate. BALANCE-SHEET Referring to the balance-sheet: if yot will turn to page,6 under the heading ol Current liabilities\" and page 7 undei he heading of \"Contingent liabilities' you will see that with the exception ol Â£491,502 included in the former item ant .525,833 included in the latter item-- otal of Â£1,017,335-the whole of the de. elopment expenditure at Irthlingborough Ebbw Vale and Redbourn had been taker are of as at 1st April last, and if you will refer to page 10 under the heading \" De- entures\" you will find that we still hac indrawn Â£1,910,590 of the Â£5,500,000 Prio Lien stock made available to us. If from this you deduct the Â£1,017,339 Iready referred to, due to be paid to comr plete the capital expenditure programme you will see as at 1st April last we still had available Â£893,255, plus accruing profits, to take care of A.R.P. defence, ormal recurring capital expenditure, dditional working capital and othei equiremente. rince 1st April we have taken un 781,000 further Prior Lien debentures, ind as at yesterday the total issued was 4,370,410, of which we have redeemed 222,475, so that to-day we have outstand ing Â£4,147,935, which, added to the Â£500,000 subscribed in Ordinary shares at ar by the Bank of England, means we ave in the business Â£4,647,935 of the 6,000,000 made available to us by the nanks. As at 1st September last we had stand ng to the credit of our special capital sxpenditure banking account Â£108,000 fter having liquidated since 1st April ;397,000 of the Â£1,017,335 that then re iained to be paid, leaving still to pay, say, 620,000 to complete the programme. Since 1st April we have substantially icreased our stocks, and at date still have indrawn Â£1,129,000 Prior Lien debentures. You will observe that this year we have lebited to general reserve Â£200,000 of the iterest charges on the new capital xpenditure. The whole of the balance has been taken are of out of the profits of the three rars, although a large portion of these nterest charges could, with some justifi ation, have been capitalised inasmuch as nterest on capital expenditure on so large scale definitely forms part of the total ost. SOUNDER POSITION From the point of view of the company's alance-sheet, our position is sounder than t the time the new capital was issued, ,ecause the new works are now operating t a profit, and since April, 1936, we have etained in the business Â£1,200,000 via de- reciation reserve and the Â£1,250,000 remium, less redemption and issue ex- enses, and we have charged to profit and nss account a substantial amount repre- ented by interest on the new and (up to 1st March) unremunerative capital, while ur old type plant is to-day every bit as fficient as it was at prospectus date. This comparison of our old type plant a made qua that of similar plant in the ndustry. The efficiency of the new plant does, owever, indicate that in the not very istant future much of this old type plant Nill have to be replaced by modern plant. This being so it will be of interest to ou to know that we own 265 old type beet and tinplate mills, which stand in ur books at a net figure of approximately 1,600,000, which is of course considerably ass than their original erection cost. Inasmuch as it is unlikely that similar vpe plant will ever again be built, we nust face the fact that over the next few ears much of this plant will have to be 'ritten off. Prior to the outbreak of war the tin- late industry was considering the best neans of taking care of this problem of id type plant and engaged framing a rade redundancy scheme. In recent months 75 per cent. of this Id type plant has been operating and arning modest profits. TRANSFERS FROM RESERVE Referring again to the balance-sheet, it muld perhaps be said the gross profits of he year under review should have been lbited with the Â£384,870 charged to eneral reserve account (see page 11)l nd that no amount should have been ransferred from the contingencies reserve o take care of the Â£107,492 losses on tocks and forward contracts, etc. (See age 8.) If thÂ«s had hann dnne. in,,-in .,. |.~.,, ng a net profit for the year of Â£42.061, L loss of Â£450,301 would have been ecorded. Your directors thought in view of all the ircumstances and the very large percent- ge of total capital represented by new lant that it would be unfair to share- lolders to create a record that so mis- epresented the true earning power of the ompany, although had profts been avail- ble the items to whiili I have referred rould doubtless have been charged .gainst them. When the Prior Lien debentures were ;sued a condition was imposed that if any ,ortion of the general reserve was applied n writing off losses or otherwise a sum qual to the amount so applied should be ransferred to gentral i *derve out of the balance of profits of future financie years. CLAIM ON CURRENT YEAR'S PROFi' This means that out of the curren year's net profit the Â£267,429 (see PagR 11) that has been debited to genera reserve will have to be restored, so tha including the agreed Â£100,000 that has ti be placed to reserve out of each year' profits a total of Â£367,429 will have to b1 transferred from the current year's, o future earnings, before any profits wil be available for distribution. It would be unwise in this period o uncertainty to attempt to forecast wha the current year's net profits will be. Our existing profit margins on tinplate produced in our old type mills are great!: reduced, owing to the substantial advanc in the price of tin from Â£170 per ton ii April, 1938, to Â£230 to-day-the whole o which we have taken care of in our cosi but on the assumption that our tota profits are maintained at the rate o recent months I am entitled to say tha there is no ground for supposing the ne profits of the current year will not sub stantially exceed the Â£367,429 earmarkei for transfer to general reserve account and this, after providing an additions Â£210,000 for depreciation, bringing depre ciation allocation up to Â£650,000 for th year. Before leaving this item I think it righ to inform you that we have instructed ou auditors to examine the whole assets o the company, and report what, in thei judgment, would be a reasonable alloca tion for depreciation. It may be that they will report tha Â£650,000 per annum is insufficient-but i will be comforting to shareholders to kno, that some of our assets are undervalued and I do not anticipate a too seriou increase. GOODWILL ITEM The item of Â£448,050 described in th balance-sheet as goodwill, etc., is repre sented, in the main, by-as I think I hav explained on previous occasions-th excess of the price paid for the Grovesend shares over their par value. Inasmucl as the net profits of the Grovesend grou] last year after providing for the dividenm on the Preference shares approximates 4( per cent. on the par value of the Ordinar: capital I do not think for the present wi need exercise our minds about this good will item. There is another item on the balance sheet under \" Intangible assets\"-sei Page 7-representing balance of exces: wartime expenditure on our Redbouri plant. I think it will be found that this viewe, in the light of to-day's conditions is con servative. The auditors will of course take thi: item into account when reporting o0 depreciation allocations as a whole. The item as you know was reduced b: the allocation of Â£893,965 ex the premiun on the Ordinary shares issued. As you are aware, when we raised the new money we held the sole rights to rol wide continuous strip in this country, bu during the erection of our plant anothe: manufacturer embarked upon the erectioi of a somewhat similar plant withou previously obtaining from us a sub license. We have now granted to this com petitor a sub-license on terms favourabl to them but under conditions that.never theless substantially reduce the royalt! and service charges to us. Our annual payments under this head ing will be debited to production cost anm represent an annual charge of compara tive unimportance. The Â£84,000 prepaid royalties an( service charges which appeared ir previous years' balance-sheets have thi. year been charged against the genera reserve account. RELATIONS WITH CONTROL COMMITTEE You would perhaps wish me to com- ment on our relationship with the contra committee. It is wrong to suppose that the com- mittee attempt to interfere with the day- to-day management of our business o. have the slightest desire to suppress out progress. Personally, in the widest sense, I wel- come the influence they, in conjunction with the federation, have over the desting of our company, because under normal conditions I look to that influence tc prevent the building of modern plant by others in excess of the requirements ol the country's normal demand. To build surplus modern plant would be worse-from a shareholder's point of view -than having no modern plant, because modern plant to justify its huge capital cost must be operated approximately tc capacity which would be impossible if capacity materially exceeded demand. It is therefore in the interests of ouc shareholders and the public that in this country we avoid the mistake that has been made in America where excess modern plant built competitively without any sort of control has resulted in efficient but very expensive plant-becoming unremunerative. TRIBUTE TO OFFICERS AND STAFF i should this year like to pay a special tribute to the officers and staff of this company and colleagues who have shared with me the anxiety inseparable from the building of our huge new plant, the extra work it has entailed and the temporary disappointments it has brought. Your company now possesses one of the finest plants in the world, and our steel capacity is equal to 10 per cent. of the total ingot capacity of the country, and what is more interesting some 50 per cent. of this ingot capacity has a book value approximating 25s 3d per ingot-ton. which is a very low figure. Further, in normal times-that is, in times of chenn -ran-nthi Inw-canitanlnat lant is capable ofproducing ingo.ts on an fo.b. basis that compares favourably with any integrated modern plant in this country. ELASTICITY OF PLANT The elasticity of this 50 per cent. low- capital-cost steel plant is not generally recognised. It consists of six completely independent units, each with an average output of 120,000 tons of ingots per annum. In times of fluctuating demand we are in a position to light up or close down at comparatively small cost these separate units, and thus make possible in times of poor demand to work our Ebbw Vale and Redbourn integrated plants fully. Lest any of my remarks made in an attempt to give you a true value picture of your property should be interpreted by you as optimistic, I would remind you that n times of poor demand our profits must shrink and that we have no control over world conditions or world demand. In conclusion it will be gratifying to you to know that your company is giving direct employment to over 31,000 men, as against 13,650 men seven years ago. (Applause.) Before I put the resolution to the meet- ing, I feel that I ought to refer to the conditions under which we meet. We meet to-day in a state of war and I think you will agree that it is fitting that we should place at the disposal of the Government the whole of the resources of your great company. (Applause.) I now move: \"That the directors' re- port and accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1939, as submitted be approved and adopted.\" Mr. J. E. James (deputy-chairman and managing director) seconded the resolu- tion, and, the Chairman having replied to questions, it was carried unanimously. The auditors, Messrs. Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co., were reappointed. On the motion of Mr. Barnabas Rus- sell a hearty vote of thanks to and confidence in the directors concluded the proceedings.",
