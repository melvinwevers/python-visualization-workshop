SATURDAY Afternoon. City markets found no difficulty in completing their business this morn- ing without the extra banking hour allowed last Saturday. 'The exchange control authorities again were undisturbed by movements in the sterling-dollar quotation on New York, and the London rate was left unchanged this morning. Turnover in the discount market was small, but the clearing banks were buyers of October maturities at 3 per cent, and November dates at 3% per cent. The \" hot\" Treasury bills were 3%'/ per cent., rather buyers. The raising of the syndicate's aggregate tender was a subject of discussion and it was suggested that the change of method might have the effect of increasing willingness to sell bills to the banks or of maintaining rates.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 17th Sept. Industrial stocks sold off 1 to 4 points on Saturday before meeting with support, and Rails also declined, whereas Utilities improved for the fifth successive day. Operators were nervous over the implica- tions of the Russo-Japanese pact and the Canadian Government's assumption of control of trade and exchange. It is also feared that the opposition to the proposed amendment of the Neutrality Act may be greater than expected, although hopes are fairly high that Congress will repeal the arms embargo at its special session next Thursday. Following a comparatively steady open- ing, most stocks fell as pressure against the pivotals unsettled the list. Steels were very heavy, and Chemicals, Aircrafts and Coppers encountered considerable profit- taking. Rails showed some resistance, while Utilities were strong. In the late dealings a rally left final prices above the worst, but the close was easy, with net losses generally of fractions to 2 points. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average fell 1.88 to 152.15 and Rails reacted 0.41 to 32.07, whereas Utilities gained 0.47 at 25.01. Turnover for the two-hour session reached 1,080,000 shares, covering 801 stocks, of which 500 declined, 158 improved and 143 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Governments kept firm, as did Industrial and Utility issues, but Railroads were lower. Bond sales for the short session amounted to $5,360,000. Moody's commodity index (31st Dec, 1931=100) was 169.1, against 169.9 on Friday. Recent trading sessions have lifted the Dow-Jones Industrial stock average to virtually the peak of last November. Since last Tuesday, when the closing average nearly reached 156, more atten- tion has been paid to the so-called second-line stocks, or shares of companies manufacturing consumer goods, as well as Rails, where less drastic price regulation is likely. Utilities have also received sup- port on expected benefits from the rising trend of trade activity. In the steel industry an operating rate of 80 to 90 per cent. for the autumn seems a conservative estimate. Mills in the Pitts- burg and Youngstown districts are scheduled to start this week at 73 and 78 per cent. respectively-advances of 6 and 14 points on last Monday. Huge orders for machine-tools are said to have been placed this month. The August index for machine-tool orders is 206.5, compared with 230.9 for July, but the decline is attributed to a considerable slackening in foreign orders, with domestic orders almost equalling those of July. Motor-car production last week is esti- mated by Ward's at 41,245 units, compared with 26,865 units in the previous week. B. F. Goodrich Company has raised its price, of mechanical rubber goods by from 5 to 12 per cent., with effect from 1st Octo- ber, owing to the rising cost of raw mate- rials. Bankers' acceptances outstanding on 31st August aggregated $235,000,000, com- pared with $236,000,000 on 31st July. AVERAGES AND VOLUME C os !leails Indus.

As things are, what pre-war Con- tango position has been kept in being was arranged as long ago as last Wednesday. It only remains for the due payments so be made on Thursday, whereupon the House will be swept an i garnished for the smooth running of the cash dealing system to which it is to be indefinitely restricted. Winning By Waiting Although the decision to prepare for three years or more of hostilities has chilled some ultra-optimistic folk it cannot be said to have affected the policy of the leaders of the City. They had already tightened their belts and gathered in their resources to be able to cope as far as possible with all eventualities. It is argued that any small opera- tor who may have been rendered sufficiently nervous to contemplate turning his securities into cash should not be in a hurry to do so. After the special Settlement next Thursday the cash dealings r6gime should work much more freely. It is a system which usually favours bulls. Hope springs eternal. Anyone who has been in too great a hurry to sell his Commodity shares is already in many cases finding good cause for repentance. Now that the more or less forced sellers are vanishing from the scene the course on balance of these particular equities is thought likely to be upwards. People inte- rested in base-metal companies are, however, becoming a little impatient to learn the bases on which London dealings in copper, tin, lead and zinc ae to be resumed. Possibly we may get a decision to-day as regards tin. Yankee Dealings Since the outbreak of war so much American stock has already been sold to New York-providing the Treasury with a very welcome flow of dollars-- that the floating supply is in some cases becoming uncomfortably low. Any jobber who dares to be a bear for a few hours has to depend upon the stock coming in; under Treasury re- gulations he may not bid for it in New York, nor indeed buy the stock from any foreign centre. There is nothing to hinder domestic dealings in Yankees so long as the names of the new purchasers are registered with M~e Bank of England; It is only when the shares are sold to New York that the dollar proceeds have to be handed over to the Bank of England, which will at present ex- change the money into sterling at $4.04 to the Â£. But no holder need sell his Yankees, or other foreign securities, until he. is asked by the Treasury to do so, which is not likely to happen for a very long time to come. Dimmed Electricity There has been rather persistent selling of Electric Lighting Ordinary shares as a sequel to the black-out regu- lations, and the restriction of domestic consumption to 75 per cent. of last year. A market friend suggests that in at any rate some cases the diminution in demand from this source may be largely counteracted by the vastly increased demand from industry on a war-time basis. There is the increased cost factof, of course, but that applies to every- thing, albeit practically all, indus- trial contracts for electricity have a movable price fluctuating with the price of coal. High Yields At present quotations unusually high yields are offered. For instance: County of London Electric at 30s- to yield 7 per cent. upon a 101 per cent. dividend paid for years past. Edmundsons' Electricity at 21s 3d- to yield 51 per cent. on the dividend of 51 per cent. which has been paid for the last three years. Llanelly and District Elec. at 18s-to yield 64 per cent. on the current 54 per cent. dividend paid for the last three years. Metropoli- tan Electric at 38s-to yield 6.6 pel cent. on the 12 per cent. dividend paid for thelast two years. \"After all,\" observes my House friend, \"the war isn't going to last for ever, and one of the first things to return to normality will be domestic and street lighting.\" Ght Btarist",

   "text_content" : "With the completion of the first full week of Stock Exchange business under the war-time regime dealers and public are rapidly becoming acclimatised to the new conditions. The past week's experience, however, is hardly likely to be typical of the weeks that are to come. A number of special circumstances, mostly of a bearish nature, have combined to depress prices. It is to the credit of the investor that his confidence in the Allies' cause has been reflected in the almost com- plete absence of panic selling and that where falls in prices have taken place there have generally been sufficient economic reasons for them. Firstly, in broad terms, it is evident that the cost of the conflict must fall heavily on the shoulders of industry and that share- holders in common with consumers will have to make sacrifices in turn. Until the Government is able to announce, by way of a war Budget, the incidence of proposed new taxation an unknown factor hangs over the share market in the face of which the investor can do no more than exercise caution. It is therefore reasonable that the week should have seen a precautionary marking down of the shares of such indus- tries as experience and common sense mark out as the most likely subject of in- creased taxation. Tobaccos, breweries and distilleries obviously lie in this category, and the falls that have taken place in these descriptions appear to be fully justified by the uncertainty with which these industries are faced at present. INSURANCE OF STOCKS The second unknown factor which leads to market caution is the effect of the Government scheme for the compulsory in- surance of stocks of goods. Although the rate at which stocks are to be insured is known to be 6 per cent, per annum, the value of stocks concerned is a quantity at which brokers can only guess. Obviously, such concerns as the chain stores will be faced with particularly heavy premiums. Uncertainty in this direction is increased by the widespread belief that the rate has been fixed without consultation with any of the recognised experts of the commercial world. Risk of damage from air raids is evidently actuarially unassessable, but the point of view that the rate has been fixed high enough to include not only the neces- sary premium but also a further indirect tax on industry is gaining ground and is a further good reason for investment caution. In the face of all this the behaviour of markets can only be regarded as very satisfactory. True, the volume of business has been small and brokers have found that the reduced hours have more than sufficed for the handling of the few bar- gains that have been possible. In many sections of the market dealings have been a question of negotiation, but the decline in prices has been no more than circum- stances appeared to justify and there is every reason to suppose that business will expand as the nature of the nation's war economy becomes more clear. MINIMUM PRICES Perhaps the greatest brake on dealings has been provided by the fixing of minimum prices in the gilt-edged market. Minimum prices are always an enemy of a free market, but it is well to remember that it is their intention to be so and that their professed purpose is to retard any movement that might gather dangerous momentum. Throughout the week it has been impossible to dispose of any sub- stantial quantity of gilt-edged stock with ease. Thus, desirable as the minima are for the-protection of the individual from the point of view of confidence, they have proved a serious difficulty to those who nave a genuine need of an increased measure of liquidity. Brokers have fre- quently told of their inability to sell stock on behalf of the banks and the insurance companies whose desire for increased cash resources is completely justifiable. It is reported that dealers are becoming dis- satisfied with the present state of affairs and that representations have already been made to the Stock Exchange Com- mittee for the revision of the present minima. The prices were established with the best of intentions and should their continued existence prove embarrass- ing the Committee will no doubt be quick to amend them. Meanwhile the difficulty of disposing of gilt-edged stocks has led to selling in other sections of the market. Bank and Insur- ance shares have been disposed of which would not have been offered under normal conditions. HOME RAILS ON OFFER The unofficial minimum prices fixed in the Home Rail market have also been the subject of dealers' criticisms. There has been the same predominance of sellers in this section reflected clearly in the decline in the prices of the uncontrolled Ordinary stocks. Here it is patent that no valuable view of the market can be taken until the terms on which the Government will com- pensate the rails for their use during war- time is known. The end of the week saw an encouraging if slight change of senti- ment, and while the pressure on the prior charges eased, the Ordinary stocks re- gained a part of their earlier losses. Although the general experience of the Stock Markets has been one of downward adjustment bright patches have not been lacking. Shipping shares have continued their rise. Reasonably assured of ;fall employment for the duration of hostilities and little affected by the compulsory in- surance of stocks, shipping companies appear amply to justify the investor's con- fidence. OILS AND METALS BOUGHT The vital importance of the petroleum industry in war time has attracted atten- tion to Oil shares and most issues in this group closed the week substantially to the good. Trinidad Oil share prospects are discussed on Page Three Col. 2. Of equal importance are supplies of base-metals and this also has been reflected in the Stock Market. Tin, Copper and Manganese shares have all advanced and demand for them continues. Else- where the rise in the price of rubber has been followed by a corresponding im- provement in Rubber shares. Since war was declared the commodity has been up to 10%d and is still well above pre-war levels. At the same time the quota has been increased for the quarter beginning 1st October from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. and average releases for 1939 will thus amount to 57% per cent., as com- pared with 55 per cent. in 1938. S. AMERICAN INTERESTS Food supplies are as important as com- modity supplies. The Argentine comes into a new importance as a supplier of wheat and the rise in Argentine Rail prices (discussed on Page Three Col. 7) anticipates heavy traffics in the months to come. Chile as a supplier of nitrate and iodine has not been ignored and a quiet demand for that country's issues has been a feature of the Foreign bond market. The experience of the next few days is to be expected to be a continuation of that of last week. The first shock of war is over, and has been well taken, but the clarification of the position on which in- creased activity must wait is a slow process and cannot be hurried.

   "text_content" : "Textile and Shipping shares have been strong features in the Provincial Stock Markets during last week. ' Otherwise, prices are mostly lower on the period. Speculative interest in low-priced Textile descriptions has been encouraged on the Manchester Stock Exchange by the more favourable trade outlook. The sharp rise in raw cotton values benefits spinners and manufacturers by raising the value of stocks; it has also stimulated consumers' demand. Lancashire Cotton Corporation have been prominent with an advance to 13s 9d, against 10s a fortnight ago. This com- pany is believed to be doing exceptionally well just now. Fine Spinners Ordinary have risen last week from 3s 3d to 4s 3d and the Preference from 8s to 9s 3d. Joshua Hoyle have moved up to 2s 3d; Calico Printers Ordinary to 5s 3d and the Preference to 7s on the announcement of a 12% per cent. increase in printing rates. Bradford Dyers Ordinary have spurted to 5s 6d and the Preference to 7s 6d. This company has also raised charges for dyeing certain cotton piece-goods by 20 per cent. Bleachers Ordinary and Preference are appreciably higher at 3s 6d and 6s respec- tively. Rylands have been raised to 7s 9d. LIVERPOOL IRREGULAR Business on the Liverpool Stock Ex- change has shown a gradual expansion. Shipping shares were a strong feature in the early part of last week, but profit- taking ensued and peak levels have not been maintained. Cunards finished 2s 3d up at 4s 3d, Elder Dempster Holdings Is 6d at 25e 6d, Furness Withys 2s at 22s 3d P.,and O. Deferred ls at 22s, Coast Lines-3s at 13s 6d. FALLS AT BIRMINGHAM Interest in the Birmingham market has been largely confined to the big Industrial shares, but more prices are now being made in local issues and there has been a general fall in prices. Breweries have ben particularly flat, Mitchells droppin from 678 6d to 57s 6d, Ansells from 65s d to 58s and Wolverhamptons from 66s 3d to 58s 9d. Among Engineering, Tool shares have held up frirly well, Coventry Gauge at ______ 5s 3d and Kitchen and Wade at 13s 9d being slightly lower, and Moss Gear main- tained at 7s 9d and Brooke Tool at 12s 6d. Small Arms have lost Is at 25s, Averys are down to 68s 3d, Birmingham Wagons to 25s, Webley and Scott to 14s 4%d and Radiation to 30s. Valor are still bid for at 19s. C. and W. Walker have declined to 22s 6d, Henry Hope to 22s 6d, Tube Investments to 77s 9d and Stewarts and Lloyds to 40s 7%Yd. DECLINES AT BRISTOL At Bristol the passing of the first full week of wartime markets has brought no greater freedom of dealings. Some severe declines have been suffered by prominent Industrial shares. Although a few bargain-hunters have appeared for Imperial Tobaccos, the market has been a seller on balance owing to considerations of taxation possibilities, war risks in- surance and leaf costs. A fall in the price from 123s 9d to 105s 9d on the week should have gone far to allow for these adverse factors. SHIPPINGS UP AT CARDIFF Outstanding feature on the Cardiff Stock Exchange during the past week was the strong buying of Shipping shares, which, although closing under the best on profit-taking, showed substantial gains. Brynymor closed at 3s 6d, Britain 14s 6d, Claymore 6s, Chellew 8s 6d (after 9s 1~d), Eclipse 5s, Furness Withy 23s (after 24s 3d), Craig 9s and Reardon Smith 16s (after 16s 3d). ACTIVITY AT DUBLIN Dublin stock markets displayed fair activity last week and provided several features of interest..

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange remains open, and in Throgmorton-street. The Treasury wanted the House to reopen. The Home Office said that if it did this would be in contravention of the Government's desire to prevent congregation of a number of people in one place. The Treasury won. The chief argument in favour of revising minimum prices in the Consol market is that, as things are at pre- sent, people who want money in order to meet obligations, finding them- selves precluded from selling their gilt-edged holdings, are forced to realise whatever shares they can sell in other markets. The repercussion is felt more par- ticularly among Industrials. It must be acknowledged that the desire for gilt-edged minima being reduced has at least tangible reason to support its claim. Business in various directions is frozen by the difficulty which holders of gilt-edged stocks experience in dis- posing of their interests. If this were to be relaxed, and, as a result, the gilt-edged market became freer, it would react favourably on a number of others. Dear Debenture Midland Counties Three and a-Half per Cent. debenture stock, 1952-1962. because it happens to be in very short supply, can be sold at 911. The security is first-class, but the stock is overpriced by comparison with many others. It should be sold while the going is good. Rhodesian Copper Referring to our note last week anent Rhodesian copper companies, a fellow-member of the House writes to me saying it is surely more advan- tageous to this country to buy Rhodesian copper, for which it pays sterling, than to buy copper in America. The same applies, he adds, to the Union MiniBre. On this assumption it may be taken for granted that earnings of Rhodesian copper companies will show a substan- tial increase. The Government will take, no doubt, a large percentage of this increase, but the companies should be assured now of a handsome income so long as the war continues. \" As the route via the Benguela Rail- way,\" he concludes, \" is the shorter one, the Tanganyika Company should also benefit.\" The S.E. Population The daily attendance of members and clerks in the House is noticeably less than usual, but the difference would have been more marked had the Stock Exchange Managers and Committee made no concessions in the way of per- mitting substitutes to take the places of men called up. It may be useful to mention that both bodies-Managers and Committee-are ready to do every- thing in their power to assist members -and thereby, of course, the public interest-in the way of facilitating the conduct of business. Stock Exchange Rules need not pre- vent anybody from making application to the Stock Exchange authorities for admission or substitution, where either would be of service to the common cause, whether such application appears to be strictly in accordance with pre- war procedure or not.

   "text_content" : "It is probable, though by no means certain, that the metal market will reopen this morning. The problems which have had to be faced by the metal market authorities consequent upon the outbreak of war have neces- sarily been vastly more complicated than those of the Stock Exchange. Except in the matter of arbitrage the latter is, after all, comparatively little affected in its purely technical opera- tions by overseas transport difficulties and by considerations of international politics. The part which should be played by the Stock Exchange in time of war is perfectly clear, but it is by no means so obvious how the best use can be made of the mechanism of the Metal Exchange, channeling as it does all our supplies of some essential war materials. At first sight the ideas of a market and of the Ministry of Supply's policy of controlled prices seem in direct contradiction. What, presumably, is to happen is that the market will, as it were, constitute the pool of available metal, licenses to buy from which will be issued to the consumer by the Ministry. The maintenance of our supplies of the base metals should present little difficulty. Our control of the seas and the large quantities of copper, tin and lead which are produced in the Empire place Great Britain and her allies in a strong position to ensure that their requirements will be fully met. One reason for the closing of the Metal Exchange is thought to have been that negotiations are now being carried on with the Dominion and Colonial Governments to discover how much metal they are prepared to supply and at what price. The attempt to deal in tin was encouraged by the fact that the price is controlled by the pool authorities and that tin is less essential as a war commodity than the three other base metals. But the effort failed owing to the vast disparity which developed between the United States and the British prices, and it is understood that discussions aimed at a solution of this problem are also taking place between the authorities concerned. Even more immediate questions have to be settled in the Metal Exchange itself. Members are natur- ally anxious for an early reopening in order that the already existing position may be liquidated and a co- operative attempt made to smooth over the difficulties resulting from the outbreak of war. Two typical prob- lems are presented by the losses incurred in consequence of the ban upon exports of base metals from this country and by the additional trans- port and insurance expenses involved by the diversion of certain cargoes from London to some other port owing to the submarine menace. The Metal Exchange will probably find its adjustment to war conditions con- siderably more difficult than has the Stock Market, and dealings to-day will be watched with very great interest. It is important that in the long-term arrangements which are now being made the importance of maintaining London's position in the entrepot trade should not be overlooked."

   "text_content" : "Numerous companies maintain share registers both in an oversea centre and in Britain. By doing this they add greatly to the convenience of their shareholders in both areas, through facilitating transfers as and when the need arises, and at the same time they help to popularise their shares with in- vestors. In the ordinary course of events there is no barrier to the re- moval of a given holding from one register to another, but, like so many other operations, those of this nature will not be so easy to execute, in some cases, while the Treasury control of securities remains in force. It is now well known that, except with the per- mission of the Treasury, \"no person shall . . . sell, transfer or do any- thing which involves the creation of a charge on, securities of any such class\" as the Treasury may specify, likely to be marketable outside the United Kingdom. Comprehensive in itself, that instruc- tion and others accompanying it are made still more so by the definition of some of the terms employed. In the case cited, the word transfer, in rela- tion to securities, is made to include \" the transfer thereof from one register to another.\" Thus such a transfer now requires official sanction in regard to any security falling within the group already indicated by the Treasury, comprising those either specifically or optionally payable in dollars (United States or Canadian) or a number of other foreign currencies."

Tonnage milled passed the 2 million mark for the first time and established a record, with an advance of. 171,000 tons on the pre- vious year. The average value was lower at 3.424 dwts against 3.692 dwts, and while the average net price re- ceived for gold was 146s 7d against 189s 8d per fine ounce, the total of 860,500 ozs declared was only 3,300 ozs more than in 1938. In consequence working revenue was rather lower at 25s 2d against 25s 9d per ton milled, but on the other hand the unit cost of working expenditure was reduced from 19s 9d to 18s 10d. On balance, working profit came out at 6s 4d against 6s per ton milled, and net profit was Â£76,600 higher at Â£671,800. Good progress has been made in development, and a re-esti- mate of ore reserves .at 30th June showed a total of 1mj million tons with an average value of. 3:9 dwts. The increase is 61,800 tons in available re- serve, but a progressive decline in value has been noted for some time. In addition, there are 1,398,100 tons with a value of 4.1 dwts in shaft and safety pillars not available for stoping. The operations during the year have resulted in a substantial improvement in the financial position, as the un- appropriated balance of Â£265,800 is about Â£60,000 more than before, and net cash, after allowing for current liabilities, has been increased from Â£67,400 to Â£127,900.",

   "text_content" : "A moderate decline in the earnings of the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Com- pany and the Staveley Coal and Iron Company reflects the fall in demand for coal and iron during the first half of the financial year to June, which was only partly made up by better business in the first six months of the current year. The drop of Â£15,400 in the net profit of Sheepbridge repre- sents a decline of about 6 per cent. and permits of a repetition of the 121 per cent. dividend free of tax on the Ordinary shares. Reserve alloca- tions work out much the same as before, for while Â£30,000 against Â£50,000 is put to reserve for renewals a net item of Â£15,000 for A.R.P. equip- ment appears. Capital was increased by 133,900 new shares during the year for the acquisition of the Babbington Coal Company's properties, but the new shares do not rank for dividend this time. A rather larger decline in net profit of Â£37,300, or about 73 per cent., is shown by the Staveley Company. The dividend is reduced from 11 per cent. to 10 per cent., tax free, but alloca- tions remain the same at Â£100,000 to general reserve and Â£20,000 for de- preciation of workmen's houses. The conservative method of appropriation in each case has allowed the carry- forward to be increased and reserves and the usual liquidity of the balance- sheet have been well maintained. The Staveley Company has completed the new foundry for the production of special castings, and this is now work- ing to capacity, while the Blackshale Seam at Markham Colliery resumed normal output in April after re- equipment following the explosion last year.",

The War Budget approved on Tuesday night by the House of Commons repre- sents a serious effort to meet the cost of the emergency as far as possible out of taxation from the start. Most striking of the fiscal changes is the imposition of a tax ranging from 10 to 60 per cent. on profits of all busi- nesses earning from 5 to 25 per cent. above the average for the last four years. There is also a war surtax on indi- vidual incomes amounting to 20 per cent. of the total tax otherwise pay- able. Income-tax is raised from 15 to 18 per cent., and in the case of con- solidated returns from 17 to 20 per cent. Certain consumption goods of a sumptuary character are also taxed more highly, notably beer, spirits, wines, cigarettes, coffee and tea.

   "text_content" : "By our INSURANCE CORRESPONDENT As was pointed out in THE FINANCIAL TIMES recently by Autoly- cus, investment in Insurance shares is now the principal legitimate method by which a war hedge can be obtained. This is because most insurance com- panies operate very largely in the United States, and have a large part of their investments in that country. The Royal Insurance Company ranks high in this list. At the end of 1938 total assets amounted to Â£61,000,000, of which approximately Â£31,000,000 represented the life assurance assets. Considering the balance of Â£30,000,000 it appears that of this amount Â£21,000,000, or approximately 70 per cent., is comprised of assets in the United States. It is not suggested that these figures are entirely accurate, but they are sufficient to show the exceedingly large interest which the Royal has in the United States. PREMIUM INCOME Premium income in the fire, marine and accident departments for the last three years is shown in the table below:- Accident & Fire Marine General Total e e e 4 1936 ... 5,526,000 807.000 8,494,000 11,827.000 197 ... 5,539.000 926.000 5,946,000 12,411.000 1938 ... 5,420,000 1,015,000 6.031,000 12,475.000 The Royal is one of the few insurance companies to show an increase in the premium income last year, although the rise at Â£64,000 is comparatively small. Fire premiums fell by Â£110,000, largely owing to the decline in United States premiums as a result of the trade condi- tions in that country in the early part of the year. Home premiums, on the other hand, showed a slight increase. Marine premiums rose by Â£89,000, and those in the accident department by Â£85,000, bringing the premium income in this department up to a new high record. There was a rather heavy decline in the fire profit in 1938, the total for the year being Â£512,000, against Â£628,000 in 1937, and Â£560,000 in 1936. The 1938 profit represented 9.4 per cent. of the premiums. In the United States, at home, and in Canada, claims were somewhat heavier. So far as the United States is concerned it was interesting to learn at the meeting that the average premium rate is now lower in that country than at any previous time in the history of United States fire insurance. MARINE DEPARTMENT In the marine department, the 1937 account was closed last year, the result being an underwriting loss of Â£46,000, against a profit of Â£41,000 in 1937, and a profit of Â£53,000 in 1936. The 1938 loss was equal approximately to 5 per cent. of the premiums. The 1938 account shows an improved position as the balance in hand at the end of the year was 54.1 per cent. of the premiums, whereas at the corre- sponding period of the 1937 account the balance in hand was 47.6 per cent. of the premiums. The improvement therefore is as much as 6.7 per cent. Excellent results were achieved in the accident department. Following on a record underwriting profit of Â£491,000 in 1937, this is easily exceeded by a profit of Â£567,000 last year. In 1936 the profit was Â£341,000, so that the improvement over the period has been very considerable. The profit ratio in 1938 was 9.4 per cent. of the premiums. It was stated at the meet- ing that the experience in the United States was especially gratifying, although certain rate reductions were being made in the United States which will have to be reckoned with in future years. In the general foreign field steady pro- gress was being made, while at home in the motor section there was again a some- what lower rate of profit, as there was also in respect of workmen's compensation business. RECORD NEW BUSINESS Record new business was otained in the large life department, new sums assured amounting to Â£5,176,000, and the life and annuity funds increased by Â£1,153,000 to Â£29,981,000 at the end of the year. The next quinquennial valuation takes place at the end of this year. The last valuation was made on strong bases, and so far as shareholders are concerned resulted in the sum of Â£250,000 being allocated to them in annual instalments of Â£50,000. The net result for the year was one of the best in the company's history. Gross underwriting profits, after charging a loss of Â£73,000 to investments, amounted to Â£1,010,000, against Â£1,177,000 in 1937 and Â£1,003,000 in 1936. After making mis- cellaneous deductions, including Â£90,000 for N.D.C., and a heavily increased charge of Â£204,000 for superannuation fund, there was a net profit of Â£496,000. Net interest earnings amounted to Â£1,210,000, making a total available for dividend of Â£1,706,000. The cost of the latter was Â£1,350,000, so that there was a margin of Â£356,000. Corresponding margins in the two previous years were Â£572,000 and Â£420,000. The figures referred to above relate only to the business of the Royal. In 1919 the Liverpool and London and Globe was acquired, but separate figures for that company are still published. The sub- sidiary, which transacts almost as much business as the Royal, enjoyed equally satisfactory results in 1938. It was able at the end of the year to pay the dividend and interest of Â£550,000 with a margin of Â£524,000, of which Â£300,000 was trans- ferred to contingency reserve. The cor- responding margin in 1937 was Â£512,000, out of which Â£450,000 was written off in- vestments and house property. In 1936 the margin was Â£316,000. These surpluses should be taken into account when con- sidering the Royal figures. The market values of investments were in the aggregate substantially above the book values. In May last the uncalled liability on the shares was reduced by 2s 6d per share, so that the Â£1 shares are now 12s 6d paid. After allowing for this, there were free reserves amounting to Â£11,700,000, against the paid-up capital of approximately Â£2,800,000.",

   "text_content" : "To the Editor of THZ FINANOIAL TIM Sir,-The change of Government in the Union of South Africa is of in- terest from an economic standpoint. Will the successor of Mr. Havenga follow the same unsympathetic atti- tude towards the investors in South African gold mines as his predecessor did by maintaining that through the devaluation of the pound sterling all profits earned by the gold-mining companies over and above a sum calculated at 150 shillings per ounce of gold shall belong to the Union of South Africa? The former Government argued that by thus expropriating the profits which otherwise would have been dis- tributed to the shareholders of the mining companies it acted in the public interest by preventing specu- lation. No further indication was given what kind of speculation should be prevented in the public interest, but it may be sur- mised that by public interest is meant the interest of the public in South Africa. In other words, in order to prevent a local evil of problematical importance millions of shareholders outside the Union, who-in so far as they do not live in Great Britain-are already suffering consider- able losses through the fluctuations in the rate of exchange caused by the devalua- tion of the pound sterling, have to forgo the equivalent influence of the rise in the price of gold, and sacrifice in addition to their immediate losses the probable benefit of a higher dividend on the stock which they hold. Penalising the Investor Why should the investor in Europe be penalised in advance to prevent a local evil in South Africa which-if required- could be prevented in several other ways? How far-except in degree-does this action of the South African Government differ from the action of the Mexican Government which-also for reasons of local public interest-expropriated the pro- duct of the soil and thereby penalsed the foreign shareholders who entrusted their capital to Mexican enterprises count- ing upon due remuneration from the pro- duct of the Mexican soil? By what right can a Government justify such expropria- tion without adequate compensation with regard to persons who owe no allegiance to the South African Government and who in good faith have entrusted their money for the development of the South African mining industry? It is most unfortunate that individual shareholders are powerless to stop such unjustifiable action which in fact amounts to confiscation of what by right and equity is owing to them. Even the U.S.A. Government, which intervened with the Mexican Government on behalf of American citizens, could make little impression upon the classic theory that a sovereign State can do what it likes if it acts in accordance with its own con- stitution. How futile then is the protest of individual shareholders who are seldom sufficiently combined to press the equity of their claims against the arbitrary actions of such sovereign States which do not hesitate to violate the dictation of honest economic dealing in international finance.-I am, &c., London, E.C.4.

   "text_content" : "HE widespread condition of urbs in rure that has resulted from the evacuation of business houses is making increasing demands on the versatility of executives. Managers and departmental heads are living the lives of country gentle- men. One banker of my acquaintance is finding his normal business pro- blems far less onerous than those ii- volved in selling the garden produce and feeding the poultry of the estate of which he is the locum squire. Office staffs now living in England's stately homes have few complaints about their change of scene. I know of several whose return to the City would cause regrets for the swimming pools and tennis courts they would leave behind them. House Merger MANY Stock Exchange firms are labouring under difficulties caused by the calls of the war and defence services on their personnel. In several of these cases amalgamation would probably prove the best solution of their problems. Three of the four partners in Peter Hicks and Co. are engaged in national service, and the firm is pro- viding one of the first war mergers by joining- forces with Hurst-Brown Buckmaster and Co. Mr. Peter Hicks, after 48 years in the City, is taking the opportunity of retiring. He is not a partner of the new firm of Hurst-Brown Buckmaster and Peter Hicks, but he will continue to attend the office where his experi- ence will be at the disposal of clients. Meeting Evacuations T HE ill wind of war blew favour- ably for a Harrogate hotel at which the first evacuated company meeting was held last week. The sufferer was the Hotel Great Central, Marylebone, at which the meeting of Barrow Barnsley Collieries was origin- ally intended to be held. The solicitude for the safety of shareholders shown by the change of venue to Harrogate is commendable; but it would be unfortunate for the City's many regular meeting halls if the practice were widely followed. Many of them have incurred con- siderable expense in equipping their buildings with shelters and the other paraphernalia of A.R.P. and share- holders need have no fear when coming to City meetings that their safety has not been considered. Clothing the Army TO meet at one sitting the Tailor of Taste, the Fifty Shilling Tailor and the man who is proud of his busi- ness, not his face, should be a delight for students of advertisements. It should be possible at the meet- ings of the panel of clothing manu- facturers which has been formed to assist the Ministry of Supply in pro- ducing Army clothing. Sir Montague Burton, Sir Henry Price, of Prices Tailors, and Mr. A. G. Rossiter, chairman of Rego Clothiers. are three of the sartorial experts chosen to rule the Army's fashions. With extensive publicity campaigns these three have revolutionised the clothing of the masses. Their experi- ence of multiple tailoring should be easily adaptable to the cutting of khaki. Roll Along IF tobacco should fall prey to Sir John Simon's supplementary Budget the trade may experience a strong turn in favour of \"roll-your-own\" cigarettes. The number of smokers making their own cigarettes since a new tax was introduced in New York this summer has been sufficient to justify most of the American tobacco com- panies in producing new brands of shredded tobacco for the purpose. Estimates of the consumption of hand-rolled cigarettes are formed from the sales of cigarette papers. These indicate that America rolled some five thousand million more cigarettes in the year to June last than in the previous twelve months. The total was over 36 thousand millions. Observer",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Considerable interest has been aroused in City circles by the news that the French exchange control has come into operation, and that, in con- sequence, sterling only will now be given for gold, French francs and other foreign exchange offered for sale. In addition, French francs only are to be given in respect of sterling balances which are offered for sale. This should help materially in re- lieving pressure on the sterling ex- change, particularly as French nationals hold considerable stocks of gold in London. As a matter of fact, although bullion brokers have been kept busy with gold offerings, the extent to which holders of the metal have applied for permis- sion (now required) to export it has been surprisingly modest. Poor facili- ties for exporting and inadequate transport, of course, are contributory factors. Bill Denominations A month's experience of the larger denominations of Treasury bills, intro- duced at the tender of 18th August, has not greatly modified the attitude first adopted by various market quarters to the Â£50,000 and Â£100,000 bills then made available. The discount companies have con- tinued to take up a considerable part of their allotments in the larger bills, while other quarters of the market, in- cluding some houses of considerable size, have gone on using the smaller bills current before the change was made, having found by experience that, despite the convenience in hand- ling carried by Â£50,000 and Â£100,000 bills, the smaller denominations are more flexible in arranging loan security and filling orders for special dates. The issue of larger denominations, it will be recalled, was believed when it was adopted to be due to a desire to facilitate handling and reduce the size of parcels as an A.R.P. measure. Although air attacks on London have so far not been made, the A.R.P. aspect of the larger Treasury bill must still be a consideration with the authorities, and the arguments for the larger bill therefore remain in force. But the change must still be con- sidered in the experimental stage, and _ the higher denominations will .only be used by the market while they are found convenient. If, as may be ex- pected, the exigencies of war finance lead to an increase in the total volume of Treasury bills outstanding from time to time, the larger bills may tend to become more popular. S. America and War The outbreak of war in Europe cannot fail to have repercussions in South America. In the first place, the various countries should benefit as suppliers of primary foodstuffs, metals and so on, with the exception perhaps of Brazil since coffee is not a necessity. Indeed, the important German market should disappear. Secondly, owing to the blockade of Germany, the \"compensation\" busi- ness of that country with South America-which has proved so com- petitive to British goods-should automatically disappear. It may also be expected that the United States of America will make a trade drive in the import markets. In this connection, a trade agreement with the Argentine is pending. -Argentine Position Argentina should benefit consider- ably from shipments of wheat, meat, etc., to Britain and her Allies and drastic changes have already occurred in the exchange market. It will be recalled, for example, that the former \"free\" exchange import rate was unified with the official rate of 17 pesos per f-the rate which has ruled for British imports for mionths past- and this move was doubtless precipi- tated by the fall in the \"free\" rate for sterling. Uruguay, like the Argentine, is believed to have benefited by British Government contracts. The official import rate was pegged to sterling on 6th September at 26id per peso, while the rate for selling export bills to the authorities has been moved up to 3312d per peso. It is understood that, so far, no modification has been made in Uruguay's control of imports, but the articles of prime necessity and raw materials will have preference and that each case will be judged on its merits.",

Scrap 'from the U.S. to Japan was another very strong section and rates from the Range jumped from $9 to $11, against $6.10 at the end of August, with up to $7.25 paid from the North Pacific coast. Time charter values are nearly treble those of a couple of weeks ago and in the transatlantic section British vessels secured up to 12s 6d for one round voyage. Eastern markets were strong and extremely quiet on the reserve of owners. It is understood that 50s has been indicated from Saigon, with owners hold- ing for 60s.

   "text_content" : "Some light on the economic conditions in which Germany is facing a war of long duration is shed by the foreign trade figures of the Reich for 1938. Germany (not counting Austria and the Protector- ate of Bohemia and Moravia) then obtained 20 per cent. of her imports from the British and French Empires. This 20 per cent. was largely composed of strategic raw materials and foodstuffs. From France and Britain and their Empires Germany bought 26 per cent. of her raw iron, 33 per cent. of her lead, 50 per cent. of her chromium, 62 per cent, of her copper, 61 per cent. of her manganese, 94 per cent. of her nickel, 60 per cent. of her zinc and 52 per cent. of her rubber. To fill the gap she must go to European countries from which she can obtain goods despite the blockade. Almost the only mineral the Soviet Union can supply is manganese, and no European country can supply nickel or rubber. Even supposing that neutral countries can increase their supplies to the Reich without violating their neutrality, how will Germany pay? She apparently inrtends to export coal, but it must be considered that her domestic coal consumption is going to be enormous. As Swedish iron can be exported to Britain via Norway almost as easily as it can to Germany the latter would only hope to get Sweden's total output if Britain were unable to deliver coal or to buy the ore in some other way.-Reuter.",

   "text_content" : "From our PARIS CORRESPONDENT The precision with which the financial and economic mobilisa- tion of France has been carried out is equalled only by the smooth efficiency of her military mobilisation to which numerous authori- tative witnesses have already borne testimony. Freedom of the exchanges in peace-time is followed, as in Great Britain, by control of the exchanges and the prohibition of capital exports during the war. A comprehensive and carefully studied scheme has been put into operation to ensure that the nation'so entire resources shall be effectively concentrated on winning the war. REPATRIATION OF INCOME SAn examination of the details of the law controlling the transfers of capital in all its forms reveals that it is based on the general principle that income derived by Frenchmen or foreigners resident in France from property abroad must be repatriated. The ownership of the property remains intact, as does the right of its disposal subject only to the condition that any sale of foreign assets must be made on French territory and to persons residing in France. There is no question, at any rate for the time being, of requisitioning foreign assets or securities or even of demanding that such assets be declared. Those who drafted the law appear to think that for the successful prose- cution of the war it will suffice, for the time being, to rely on the income from French capital abroad plus the national gold reserve-revealed by M. Reynaud as amounting to 115 milliard francs-in order to finance all foreign purchases necessitated by the war. French holders of foreign securities, for example, can trade these on the Bourse, as the first session under the new financial r6gime amply proved, subject only to finding another French buyer. The control of foreign ex- change transactions seems to have put a complete stop to any' possibility of private arbitrage operations, but it does nothing to force the holder to liquidate his property while leaving a fairly wide market open to him should he desire to do so. FOREIGN-OWNED PROPERTY Striking Feature The foreigner who is not resident in France is treated with every possible liberality in the circumstances, and it is one of the striking features of the French control scheme that there is not the slightest attempt to freeze foreign-owned property in the way the Germans have been doing for years. France wants her citizens and her permanent foreign guests to bend their entire labour and material resources to the overriding national in- terest, but she would disdain, nor does she need, to stoop to tricks in order to gather up wealth upon which she has no proper claim. For this reason everyone-French or foreign-who has contracted debts abroad prior to the enactment of the con- trol will be accorded the necessary devisen with which to pay these debts on due date. The position of a foreigner with r:gard to property in France acquired before 10th Septdmber, 1939, is one of complete freedom, subject to proof of the genuine- ness of any proposed transaction. Cash, securities, or movable property, as well as the cash equivalent of securities, movable property and real estate, etc., may be transferred abroad once the owner has proved his status as a foreigner and his possession of the property prior to the date mentioned above. The recent publica- tion of the decree prohibiting capital ex- ports, which was a carefully guarded offi- cial secret, therefore in no way constitutes a trap-door for the unsuspecting allied or neutral holder of French assets. TRANSFERS ABROAD Special. Provision Not only are the acquired rights of the foreigner scrupulously respected, but he is not to be excluded from entering the French economic circuit in the future, even with the nation engaged in the most titanic struggle of its history. Non- resident foreigners may also transfer abroad property acquired after 10th September if the property, including foreign securities, represents the counter- part of foreign exchange previously surrendered to the Exchange Control Office or was purchased with income earned on property or securities owned in France. Thus the foreigner would appear not only to suffer no prejudice by virtue of the exchange control law, but can hardly be said to be put to any grave in- convenience in regard to existing or future property rights he may desire to hold or acquire in France. As for foreigners quitting French territory, they are allowed to take out as much devisen as they declared on entering the country. Special provision will be made for travellers who entered before 10th September and who consequently were not called upon to make any devisen declaration on entry. If in a time of maximum national stress like the present the foreigner's rights had been less minutely considered, no one could have attached any special blame to France on that account. The fact that in the midst of life-and-death preoccupations the French authorities have nevertheless safe- guarded these rights to the utmost is an eloquent testimony to her levelheadedness in danger, her innate sense of justice and her fundamental faithfulness to the ideal of liberty. The exchange control law seems to pro- vide for every contingency, and accord- ingly provision has been made to avoid over-rigidity in its application. The new Exchange Office, already established and staffed in one of the larger branches of the Bank of France in Paris, will examine all applications for devisen by importers, travellers and others with oblgations abroad and will supervise all exports with a view to acquiring all exchange resulting therefrom. All questions of general policy will be decided by the Government among whose plans, I understand, is that of varying its economic and monetary procedure to corre- spond to the procedure applied by each country towards France, who will act on a fifty-fifty basis wherever possible. -All industrial and commercial orofits except from exports are now subject to limitation similar to that already applied to national defence contracts. The authori- ties are determined to make profiteering very difficult, and price control alone is considered insufficient. Tax scale is increased, the State now taking 25 per cent. of profits above 2 per cent. and 100 per cent. over 8 per cent. Excess profits are those exceeding normal remuneration for services. ."

   "text_content" : "On the assumption that war time con- sumption of oil will considerably exceed normal requirements investment demand has shown a marked leaning towards Oil shares during the past two weeks. In particular favour have been the shares of the Trinidad companies, several of which have risen substantially. To justify continued improvement it would be necessary for Trinidad's rate of production to be increased, and it is in the belief that demands of this nature will be made on the industry of the Colony that investors have taken their stand. By the standard of last year's produc- tion and exports Trinidad is a relatively unimportant source of the United King- dom's oil. In 1938 the Colony supplied some 7 per cent. only of this country's re- quirements. This 7 per cent. represented less than half Trinidad's total exports, so by the sacrifice of other markets a greater proportion could have been supplied. Trinidad, moreover, would have little difficulty in substantially increasing her rate of flow. Expansion in the past has been limited by world prices and require- ments. With these considerations taking second place to war needs the position is capable of rapid change. Whether it will be possible to keep in- vestors regularly informed of the progress of the oil companies is doubtful. Already it has been announced that publication of the usual weekly production figures of United British and Anglo-Egyptian Oil- fields has been discontinued. Without these data there is no way of gauging the fortunes of the companies and it is hoped that the others will not find it necessary to deprive their shareholders of this informa- tion. DIVIDEND ESTIMATES One of the most interesting impending events in the Oil share market is the final dividend declaration of Trinidad Lease- holds. This is due to be made next month. That a reduction in the year's payment is to be expected was made clear in May when the interim payment was cut from 10 per cent. to 7% per cent. At that time market estimates placed the probable final distribution around 15 per cent., making a total of 22% per cent., against 27% per cent. for the year. What financial policy the company's directors are likely to adopt now that war has been declared is a matter on which the most venturesome market prophets are chary of hazarding a guess. For this reason, and because it may serve as a possible pointer to other decisions, next month's announcement is awaited with unusual interest. At Friday's closing level of 4%/ Trini- dad Leaseholds shares would yield 4.9 per cent. if the dividend were 22% per cent., 4.3 per cent. if it were 20 per cent. and 3.2 per cent. if it were 15 per cent.",

The United Dominions Trust, the leading house providing long-term credits and finance for commercial and other transac- tions, expressed to THE FINANCIAL TIMES its intention to assist clients as far as con- ditions permit with the facilities they have had in the past and also to extend facilities to new customers. It is fully realised that in a time like the present it is essential to maintain the liquidity of business, and to provide facilities to the utmost degree possible. It is up to purchasers of commodities to do all in their power to carry out their obligation to the best of their ability, as in a time where many kinds of business are necessarily limited every contribution helps to keep industry moving. Under what are largely abnormal conditions it is of the greatest value to the community to carry on and not to restrict the normal flow of activity. Where genuine cases of hardship are found, owing to loss of occupation, calling up for active service or from other causes, every endeavour will be made to devise a method for dealing with the situation by some suitable arrangement. POTENTIAL DEMAND While there will undoubtedly be changes in the incidence of commercial or industrial activity, a greater circulation of money will be in evidence on balance. Munition work, Government contracts, and the various forms of paid national service will bring into existence a degree of spending power which will offset deficiencies in a number of purely peace-time occupations. All this implies a potential demand for the hire-purchase trader. The demand already experienced for push bicycles and for battery-operated wireless sets is an illustration of the result of the changes in progress. Demand for facilities will not be restricted to articles of personal or individual use. Owing to the mobilisation of the whole of national industry for war purposes, a considerable demand for indus- trial equipment can be envisaged. For many years the United Dominions Trust or its subsidiaries has developed the provision of long-term credits for industry on bank- ing lines, and a substantial demand exists for finance on these lines. A further important outlet for long-term finance will be found in farming. A large demand may be anticipated for such agri- cultural equipment as tractors, ploughs, threshing machines and other farm appliances. An extension of the principle to live stock may not improbably follow in due course as the farming industry regains its former position of prosperity. While it is the intention to interfere as little as possible with the normal course of business, future developments will neces- sarily depend on the course of money rates. A tendency to monetary stringency which would affect all types of industry, in the event of a protracted state of war, would find its reflection in stricter terms of hire- purchase, involving a larger initial deposit and a shorter period of repayment.",

   "text_content" : "London Metal Exchange dealers are hoping that the market chaos resulting from the outbreak of war will shortly be resolved, and that in consequence they will be able to satisfy the large number of accumulated trade in- quiries. Dealers will arrive in the City to- day not knowing whether the Ex- change will be reopened for trading limited to tin or whether the shut- down will be postponed further at the request of the Government. Since the commencement of hostili- ties, dealings in copper, lead and spelter have been suspended. The Exchange was opened on 6th Septem- ber for business in tin, but so heavy was the turnover and so wide the price discrepancies that the London and Eastern markets were closed by official request last Wednesday. ANGLO-U.S. TIN TALKS Heavy restocking purchases in the United States forced the American price far out of line with the maximum of Â£230 for standard metal envisaged by the Buffer Pool. Apart from the fact that Straits tin was changing hands at well over Â£300 a ton in the United States, it had been reported that London traders with export licenses were able to buy Chinese tin here at Â£230 a ton and sell in New York at Â£295 a ton. To mitigate these anomalies discussions are believed to have been taking place between the British and American Govern- ments and representatives of the tin control. Upon whether an understanding has been reached between the parties con- cerned depends, it is thought, the re- opening of the market. One result expected by some observers is the fixing of a maximum London price in excess of Â£230 a ton. An increase of perhaps Â£20 a ton would not be surprising in view of the depreciatioi of sterling. EMPIRE METAL SUPPLIES There is as yet no sign that trading in copper, lead and zinc will be resumed. One explanation for the delay is that the Government wishes first to complete a number of important contracts with Empire producers. It is reasonable to assume that before arranging for supplies through the London Metal Exchange this country should know what the Empire countries can supply-and at what price- and what those countries' own require- ments may be. Wartime expansion of Canadian and Australian industries, for example, should make abnormally heavy demands on the dominions' base metal pro- duction. These are wise precautions, but dealers hope that the fact-finding process will be completed as soon as possible. The market has other difficulties to face. One of these arises from the precautionary diversion of metal cargoes to other than their normal U.K. ports. Who shall carry the burden of consequent additional transport costs is un- decided; some dealers urge that the insurers are liable. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1",

Strong condemnation of the Federal tax on gold-mining companies of 75 per cent. on the excess gold price above Â£A.9 per ounce is voiced by Mr. J. C. Willcock, Premier of Western Australia. He points out that no account is taken of whether the mines are payable or unpayable, or prospectors prosperous or poor. The Federal Government, he continues, had its eyes turned months ago to Western Australia's valuable gold output. When a tax was then suggested he told the Federal authorities that it would injure the industry and it was thought that the proposal had been abandoned until the Government \" bombshell \" burst in the Federal House on Friday. A strong protest against the imposition of the tax is being forwarded by the State Chamber of Mines to the Federal authorities. Mining industry leaders describe the tax as a \"monstrous injustice to Western Australia.\" On the basis of the 1938 Commonwealth gold production it is computed that the State will pay more than three-quarters of the tax.",

   "text_content" : "By THE MINING EDITOR There being a larger ratio of specu- lative dealings in the Mining markets than in any other section-outside, I suppose, Yankees-it is not surpris- ing that it is taking some time to complete the transition from Account to cash dealings. As late as last Friday there was still some forced closing reported in Kaffirs. I gather that certain weakish positions in Johannesburg and Paris have also been liquidated. After the Settlement due this Thursday jobbers will have a good deal of stock de- livered to them and in such cases should be able to quote closer prices for cash dealings than was, as a rule, possible last week. MANY OBSCURITIES There are inevitably still many obscuri- ties in the outlook for both gold and base- metal companies. In particular maximum prices for copper, tin, lead and zinc have yet to be officially announced. Sales of uncut diamonds by the Diamond Trading Company have, I believe, been suspended for the time being and it is feared that new production from South Africa may be stopped. However, the Consolidated African Selection Trust may continue shipping industrial diamonds from its properties in West Africa. GOLD PRICE As regards gold the position is becoming clearer. We are still awaiting news of any definite decision regarding West African and Indian producers. Possibly the local authorities will be satisfied with the large sums already taken in royalty, etc., while H.M. Government may take its share of any increase in profits by E.P.D. on these English-registered companies. Meantime Australia has followed South Africa and Southern Rhodes;n by, in effect, fixing her buying price from the mines at 150s sterling. This is equivalent to 187, 6d in Australian currency, against last year's average of 178s 1d. Unlike the other countries, Australia will, how- ever, permit her mines to receive one- quarter of any fresh rise in the price of gold which may conceivably occur even- tually. BANGRIN TIN In view of the substantial increase in the tin quota and even on the assumption that the price of the metal is maintained at only Â£230 per ton, it is felt that most Tin shares have scope for recovery as and when market conditions become more normal. Tin shares were depressed in the first half of this year owing to the low quotas ruling. Therefore in regard to this metal it is not so much a case of companies making any inordinate profits as a result of current conditions, but more of being able to produce a reasonable quota and sell it at a fair price. As already announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES, the quota for the third quarter has been fixed at 80 per cent. This compares with the first quarter of 40 per cent. and the second quarter of 45 per cent. The fourth quarter is at present fixed at 60 per cent., but may be adjusted in accord- ance with the developments of the next month or so. Bangrin Tin Dredging Â£1 units, if obtainable at anything up topar, are con- sidered a good purchase. For 1938 the company paid 10 per cent., as against 15 per cent. for the previous year. For the first six months of the current year the working profit has been published as Â£34,000, or just over 10 per cent. on the capital Still better results would seem reason- ably assured for the second half of the year. Thus the dividend should at least be maintained, with the possibility of some increase. The company's balance-sheet shows a strong position, liquid assets amounting to Â£94,000. There is a good life ahead of the property, additional areas having been obtained during recent years.",

Spinners cannot buy raw jute and they are refusing to sell yarns at the rates ruling under the Control Order dated 1st September, which fixed the maximum value of common 8-lb cops at 2s 8d. Raw jute has advanced considerably in Calcutta, while fluctuating to some extent, but it is now reported from that centre that the Indian jute mills have agreed that not more than Rs.9% per maund for European jute and Rs.9% for native jute will be paid. It is expected that the Indian Government will co-operate with Dundee in the fixing of maximum prices for raw jute and also for Calcutta goods, which will end the speculation which has been going on in Calcutta since the beginning of this month.",

   "text_content" : "The recent strength of Argentine Rail stocks reflects the belief that benefits will accrue from increased deliveries of foodstuffs and raw materials to Great Britain and her allies. Purchasers envisage a repetition of the conditions prevailing during the last war when Argentina and the rail- ways profited by exceptionally heavy shipments of wheat, maize, meat and linseed to the Allies. Those in close touch with the railways are more cautious, stressing that condi- tions are not strictly comparable. They point to many uncertainties in the present situation, including the duration of the war, the variation of crops, the avail- ability of shipping space and possible changes in the peso rate and fluctuation in railway costs. As in the Great War the cost of coal and other materials for the railways will pre- sumably be increased. Unlike 1914 there is now road competition which may limit any increase of rates or reduce the rail- ways' share of expanded trade. CEREAL REQUIREMENTS Supplies likely to be required by this country include wheat, maize, linseed and meat. Ports are stacked with cereals. Heavy shipments could take place without bringing extra trafic to the railways; but there are substantial supplies up-country which could be railed in case of need. Shipments to this country in the near future must be limited. For at the moment all the grain storage capacity in this country is filled. And some delay is un- avoidable before the convoy system can be fully worked out. As regards new crop prospects, it is too early to make accurate estimates. There is no maize left from the current crop and the new crop cannot be estimated until the end of February. Linseed supplies cannot be gauged before the end of December; wheat until the end of November. So far as meat is concerned, if rationing is imposed on the same scale as during the last war, this country would not require much from the Argentine for home con- sumption. Our needs might well be met from Canada and the United States. But if the war is of long duration and Great Britain has to retain large forces overseas there may be a heavy call on Argentine resources. On general grounds, Argentine trade prospects appear relatively bright. The trade balance has improved stbstantially this year compared with last. For the first six months of 1939 there was a favourable balance of 191,194,000 pesos as compared with an adverse balance of 34,768,000 pesos in the first half of 1938. War in Europe should improve prospects of supplying Allied countries and raise prices for Argentine produce, though the Republic will lose a large part of her trade with Germany, which normally is one of her best customers. The public rate of exchange has im- proved during the past week, though the railways rate remains unaltered at rather more than 16 pesos to the Â£. It seems, nevertheless, that the country's financial position may be strengthened, and this would naturally make the Government less disinclined to grant more reasonable facili- ties to the railways. But it is as well to remember that, despite the greater volume of goods carried to ports on Allied a -ount during the Great War, the dividends of the leading railway companies showed no remarkable improve- ment.",
