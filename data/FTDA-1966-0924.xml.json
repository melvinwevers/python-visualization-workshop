   "text_content" : "SALISBURY. Sept. 23. Mr. In Smith today told a wildly cheering Rhodesian Front Congres in Bulawayo that he felt strongly that the end of the Independence dispute was in right. There is also good reason to think that the Rhodesian Prime Minister will allow Mr. Herbert Bowden. the Commonwealth Secretary, to meet the restricted African Nationalist leaders, Mr. Nkomo, of ZAPU, and the Rev. Sithole, of ZANU. It is now clear that, despite all manner of denials from official spokesmen, Mr. Bowden is engaged in full-scale negotiations with the Smith r6gime. The British emissaries, in the course of their discussions with leaders of Rhodesian opinion, have been making the most determined effort since last November to reach a speedy settlement. Two points will be critical ovei the next couple of days. They- are Whether or not the British Govern' meet will be able to put for ward terms considerably less severe than those envisaged in the Commonwealth communique: and Whether Mr. Smith can be isolated long enough from Rhodesian Front extremists to push tbrougb a compromise agreement. Pessimism is still the mosl realistic sentiment, simply because the answer to both these points is probably negative. Genuine Upsurge of Optimism But a genuine upsurge ol optimism must be reported from 'alisbury, based upon a aew realisation that the Critish Gover ,mqt, despite the\" ultimatum W th-m CbMfnfonwhb`onfer ence.

Mr. Smith told the Rhodesian Front Congress that he had nothing new to say about the talks, and II was \"not in the interests of Rhodesia to say anything which could rock the boat.\" If he did try, it might be misinterpreted. \"If statesmanship does not prevail, we will not be the cularits.\" . He could not say when the talks would end, and was unable to guarantee that there would be a settlement in a week, a month or a year. \"But, as long as I occupy the present chair, we will never ever deviate from the principles that this party stands for and the promises we have made to the electorate of Rhodesia.\" He called the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference \"a ten-day farce\" and said it would go down in history as one of the most unpleasant and racially conscious conferences ever. Its discussion of Rhodesia was imper- tinence. Rhodesia's Record Since UDI \"There is nothing in life that succeeds like success,\" he said of his Government's record since UDI. Rhodesia was gathering around itself more friends, and was carry ing out one of the most incredible exercises in history. \" If it turns into a test of endurance, then I put my money on Rhodesia any day.\" Our Foreign Staf writes: Sir Morrice James, peputy Under Secretary, arrived back from Salis- bury. yeterday inorrting and rpe4. t rth Commonwealth \"mfoIe on the talks, between Mr. Bowden and Mr. Smith, but it is considered unlikely that he had any startling new proposal from the Rhodestan side. He was. unable immediately to report to the Prime Minister, who went to his constituency at Huyton, Lancashire, to open a new bakery and' address a dinner. But he is likely to see Mr. Wilson on his return to-day. KAPWEPWE TALKS WITH RUSK NEW YORK, Sept. 23.

Leaders' Points I understand that these were among the main points made by leaders of the Confederation of British Industry at a 2Y4-hours meetins in London yesterday with Mr Michael Stewart, Minister for Economic Affairs. Drafts of the Government's pre. liminary thinking on how it should handle the six-month period of severe restraint which begins in January were shown to Mr. A. J. Stephen Brown, the new CBI presi. dent; Mr. John Davies, the director-generall and Sir Kenneth Allen, who heads the ldbour and social affairs committee. It soon became clear that there were substantial points of differ- ence between, tbh employers and theoveramet, but many of these ma'y ~e ioed~out in -what are likelyto be a series of discussions at this level. The employers told Mr. Stewart that contrary to reports appearing in some newspapers yesterday, they would not welcome Government action to make the -pricis and in- comes policy compulsory. If senior Ministers are contem. plating implementation of Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act, then the CBI expects them to honour the promise already given about prior consultation. I understand that the CBI's re* cent suggestion that the Prime Minister should take over leader- ship of the National Economic De. velopment Council is not favoured by Mr. Wilson. But Mr. Stewart is said to be planning to take a more active share in Neddy's activities.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1966_0924_0001_016",
   "text_content" : "By LEX Gilts dominated the scene yesterday as they have all week. Equity prices were firmer, particularly after Mr. Smith's remarks about Rhodesia, and the index put on 2.0 at 306.1. But turnover remained pitifully low. The sharpness of indivi- dual price movements demon- strated that the market is now generally short ot stock, so if there is a revival of interest once the ICI loan stock issue is out of the way, the index could move ahead quite smartly. 3 Premium In gilt-edged the mediums were again leading the way. Best prices were not always maintained at the shorter end. but the shorts and short mediums have made the run- ning and the failure of Bill Rate to fall was a warning not to be ignored. Considering how .little stock came out on profit-taking earlier in the week and all the insti- tutions' spare cash is in ICI. gilts have performed very solidly. The new Agricultural Mortgage Cor- poration loan got off to a good start and despite a lot of stag sell- ing closed higher at a premium ON%. Portents for a turther rise in the first half of next week, therefore. are reasonably promising. It is likely that more attention will be paid to the longs, and in particular to the long tap which on even the smallest rises elsewhere will be- come a very- attractive switching situation. The Government broker must have sold quite a lot last week but must want to sell a lot more as the prospect of steel nationalisation approaches. Harland & Wolff The importance of the Â£12m. loan for Harland and Wolff guaranteed by the Northern reland Government and to be followed by a considerably larger medium-term loan, is that Hailand's bargaining hand has beep immeasurably strengthened. It is already talking hard to Vickes and Cammell Laird. but ejlUwr can have been eager to tak. on a third party on the verge of liquidation, whatever the argu. ments 4 II Geddes for integration. NOW. ' Barland is solvent, and thanks to the Â£1.7m. provided for losses.op current unprofitable con. tracts can go into a new group with, a relatively clean slate. The point of a merger for Har- land's shareholders is that if the loss-making hull building side can be deconsolidated then the other activities will have a chance to shine. They do not provide pro. fits on the scale of John Brown's machine tools, but profits are there, Harland and Wolff has a quarter of the U.K. heavy marine diesel engine .parket, steel con- struction profits of over Â£100.000 a year. and ship repairing activil ties in London. Liverpool and Southampton 'employing 4.000 men. . Until any merger Is carried through, however, the possibility of enough profits to allow the re. sumption of dividends depends on no further rise in shipbuilding costs Few necks are likely to be stuck out on this score so the Northern Ireland Government's ability to veto dividend proposals during the nine month life of the initial loan is hardly material. Post 1968,'when the present order book will be out of the way, prospects could be a lot brighter merger or no merger. But at 9s 9d. less than a quarter of asset value, the share price is taking a cautious view about the speed of Harland's re- turn to the dividend list See also Page 9 John Thompson As expected. John Thompson's first half is a lot better than last year with profits before tax of Â£52,000 against a loss of Â£436,000. But this is little guide to the year's performance since the first half of last year was dogged by the re- maining low-margin boiler con- tracts In fact the boost to profits due to begin in 1966 thanks to the next and more profitable round of CEGB orders is getting off to a slow start with only a \"small im- provement \" forecast for the year on the Â£353.000 profits before tax for 1965. Moreover, with bank borrowings no less and SET cost- ing Â£300.000 for the time being, the interim dividend is passed. Whether Thompson can cover its 6 per cent. dividend this year remains unanswered. On last year's profits and 19 per cent tax rate earnings were 5.6 per cent Even on this basis adding a point to earnings requires a good rise of 16 per cent. in profits before tax. and the tax rate could be higher. The trouble is at 4s 9d to yield 6.3 per cent. and selling at 17 times earnings the share price has not fully adjusted to this situation. Of course. Thompson has some potential to offer. The delay on Fawley, reducing this year's profits increase, leaves more for next year and then there are Cottam and Pembroke waiting in the wings. But with around 85 per cent. of profits in the U.K. and a quarter tied to; the motor industry th boiler side will have to sta t fexing its muscles to stop the whole grou getting bogged down 'Tor some time. See also Page 10 Automotive Products Automotive Products has had a respectable first half with sales up from Â£17.8m. to Â£19.27m. and pre- tax profits of Â£1.25m. against Â£1.12m. But this looks like the end of the good news. Automotive is too closely tied to the motor industry to avoid being hit hard by the cut-back in car production. However, last year the second half was strike-ridden so it would be wrong to assume profits for the year will necessarily be Ipwer than the Â£2,33m. pre-tax made in 1965. In this case at 52. the shares are selling at 10V, times prospective earnings, which Is fair but no more given the like course of car output in 1967. The real trouble Is the exiguous yield, only 3.8 per cent. and the dividend firmly atuck for the next year at least. See also PIe 11",

   "text_content" : "this first week of the new Stock Exchange Account has been one of the quietest on, record for peace-time. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial Ordinary share index has risen 0.5 to 306.1, helped by the apparently better Rhodesian news. Among Oils, BP and Shell Transport have been good on the interims. Markets may become more active when Mon- day's Â£60m. ICI issue has been launched. Big Investors Move into Gilts A hopeful sign for the future this week has been that gilt-edged have been winning back more old friends in important places, includ- ing institutions and banks. Sub- stantial buying of stocks of short and medium life has had the effect of hoisting all maturities. On the week, prices have risen by about 8s per cent., making the very sub, stantial rise (for the Government market) of about 40s per cent. in about three weeks. There is little doubt that this market is now in much better shape, although the authorities can hardly want to see runaway prices while world interest rates are high and there is the need to attract foreign money into the Â£. Now that the new swap facilities for underpinning the Â£ have removed the possibility of a forced devalua- tion, the historically high yields on gilt-edged are attracting big invest- ment funds-no doubt, only until such time as the equity outlook is brighter. ICI Loan Premium Confidence The good rise in gilt-edged and the success of the Â£17m. Farmers' Loan have, of course, fortified in- tending stags of Monday's IC- Loan offer in their confidence that a substantial premium is in pros- pect; new leading 8 per cent. stocks currently command prices equiva- lent to about 4-5 premium over the \"rice at which the ICI issue is 9.eing made. Rising unemploy ment. more motor trade redundancies and decidedly mixed reports from the company world have provided a discouraging background for the equity market. The half-yearly statements to June 30 by Dunlop Rubber (net profits down from Â£4.29m. to Â£4.11m.) and Vickers (net profits 'up from Â£1.18m. to Â£1.43m.) have not meant a great deal, because the squeeze was probably not biting seriously in that period. Dunlop has just an- nounced short-time working. * The annual report of the Rank Organisation is one of the. most --- REVI SUDDEN D THE SHARP move downwards in the price of sisal marks the end of 2n atsendcd neriod of stability. The involved and lengthy (80 pes) to be issued by a British company, but at the same time one of.-th most highly intelligible for layman and expert alike. The'structure of the group is itself complicated, of course. An illuminating table for the layman is the information given for each Ordinary and \"A\" Ordinary. This is shown in pence per share, and gives net profit, after tax, at 20.6d, gross dividends (21 per cent.) 12.6d, cash flow 77,3d. and net assets 181.8d. It can be seen that cover for the dividend is about 1.6 times. The \"A\" share price is 28s 3d so that the shares are valued at 16 times 360- -- -- -- -rI- 350 - - - r r --- --/ - The Financial Times J~-H i i- I ----------[r b o -DEX OF INDUSTRIAL- ORDINARY SHARES' 9 I I 1 66 1 280JFM MJJA O ND JI 1 A S J F M A MJ J A S O N D J F M A MJ J A S earnings or about 4~4 times cash flow. Yield is about 3.7 per cent. The prospect is for still better times ahead-pre-tax profits rose from Â£11.38m. to Â£18.86m. last year-largely because of the fantastic success of Rank Xerox, which Mr. John Davis, the chair- man, expects to continue to grow at. a fast rate. At the moment, the other interests--predominantly in cinemas--are merely holding their own. The already respectable cover and the good prospect of sharply rising earnings from Rank Xerox should mean that dividends will rise again when the freeze ends. The New Look for Cammell Laird The completion of Cammell Laird's plans for the modernisa- tion and ,streamlining of the ship- building and ship-repairing in- terests has certainly worked to some purpose, for losses incurred by both last yearihave been \"sub- stantially. eliminated.\" Results from the Patent Shaft and Scottish Aviation subsidiaries also appear to be encouraging. The point that really matters, however, is that the Board is viewing the pro. spect with marked confidence. Not only is it looking forward to a trading profit substantially greater than last year, but it is also anti- cÃ½ipating that the improvement seen so far will be maintained and inereased in futuro years. The interim dividend is being maintained at 4 per cent., and ,althodtgh ;ndfations are that a 12 per cent. distribution mAy not be fully covered byearnings after tax. the Board intends to maintain that rate in the absence of unforeseen circumstances. A 12 per cent. gross dividend would cost Â£730,000. Profits, before 40 per. cent. cor- poration tax. would have to be 1l.2m. to make this sum available. Net profit before tax in 1945, was Â£513.000. This is a remarkable improvement in Cammell's for- tunes, and the share price of 7s 10/d, yield 7.7 per cent., is not overdiscounting it. Royalty Income of CPA Holds up An oddity of the preliminary profit figures of the Calico Printers' Association is that royalty income should have risen by Â£221,000 to Â£3.06m. for 1965-66, the explana- tion being increased sales of poly- ester fibre by foreign sub-licensees. In June of last year, royalty income was estimated to fall to Â£2.07m. in 1965-66. to Â£1.52m. in 1966-67, to Â£964.000 in 1967-68, to Â£701,000 in 1969 and to a significant amount thereafter. This prospective falling off in royalty income, because of the expiry of patent rights, has been the Achilles heel of the share price, which at 8s 4%d is about 50 per cent. below the 1966 peak. In view of the buoyancy of royalty revenue in practice, there must be a case for the Board to re-estimate the prospect. It was as well for shareholders that royalty income behaved so favourably last year. as political disturbances and import restrictions in Africa cost the group over Â£1.lm. in trading profits-group profit down from Â£5.39m. to Â£4.37m.-and the post-tax profits cover the maintained 16 per cent. dividend only once. Fortunately. some of the African markets have shown a \"marked recovery\" since and the Board expects the result of the current period to benefit accordingly. CPA's 9.8 per cent. dividend yield implies doubts about dividend maintenance. Emmies' Dividend Well Covered SBut for the squeeze, would there have been an increase in the 1965- 1966 dividend of Electric and Mud- cal Industries? The Board has stated that to conform with Government requirements it does not recommend a further dividend -the year's total has been main- tained at 15 per cent. It is tempt ing to think that this phrase could mean that. but for the freeze, a furber distribution would have been considered. By current standards of dividend cover. Emmies would certainly have been in a position to pay more dividend. Cover now is close on 1.6 times, well up to average. .Sales last year rose by Â£2.6m. to Â£102.8m. and profits, after tax, by Â£631,000 to Â£5.5m. In view of the prospect of a falling home market for the time being-the U.K. profits were already a little lower last year -it is a satisfactory feature that 68 per cent. of total profits last year were earned overseas. At 27s 1d, EMI yield about 5V per cent. A Better Quarter for Marley Tile Will Marley Tile (Holdinp) earn its 20 per cent. dividend this year? In the first six months (to October 31), Marley's group profit, before tax, in comparison with the corre- sponding six months of the pre. vious year. fell from Â£1.92m. to Â£1.19m., and if this rate of fall had continued, covering the dividends (including Preference) which cost Â£1.86m. gross, would have been out of the question. Happily, in the third quarter, to July 31. the rate of fall has slowed consider. ably, and profit, before tax, is down only from Â£l.10m. to Â£974,000. Profit, after tax, for the nine months comes out at Â£1.27m. (against Â£2.02m.), so that Marley is faced with the task of earning Â£590.000 after corporation tax in the final quarter to cover a 20 per cent. dividend. It actually earned Â£588,000 in the third quarter, so that but for the squeeze, which must be affect- ing margins, covering the dividend should not be too difficult. Clearly, the size of the dividend must de- pend on what the Board thinks of the prospect. The tufted carpets venture, which could materially benefit profits, has yet to reach the productive stage. Redlands Hold- iugs, a Marley competitor in tiles, has warned this week that it may reduce its dividend. Marley's 6.1 per cent. yield at 16s 3d implies confidence in the prospect. Onlooker.",

The price has slipped from Â£82 to Â£78 a ton (No. 3 long) during the week. Reasons behind the move are mounting stocks in producer coun. tries, and the lateness of the West European grain harvest, for which the provision of binding twine is the chief outlet for sisal. The longer term outlook contains additional reasons why the price should move downwards at this ime. In August and September the J.S. market has been cuaed hy the release of 11,000 tons from thu GSA stockpile-equivalent to one- fifth of the U.S. annual consump- tion, High interest rates througfh- out Western Europe continue to bring about a steady round of de- stocking by twine spinners, The market for East African sisal has oeen sharpened by keen comptli. ion from Brazil, Finally, the widely-uwalted expansion of outlets 'or natural sisal into carpet yarns and binding twine has boon inhi- bited by the success in these fields of polypropylene. new cheap ynthetlÂ¢ su stlitute,.

On the other hand, the strike of miner, on the Zambian Copper. belt Is now virtually over and this has had a weakening effect on prices.

In the first half of the year It moved to 4.1 oz per week, an increase of 5 per cent. on 'the same period of 1965. The Cocoa Chocolate and Confectionery Alliunce figurs also show that the nation's consumption of these items -is now running at the impressive rule of Â£323m. a year, The forward prospect is some- what less optimistic, however, for there are indications that the British, already the world'. highest consumers of chocolate and sugar confectionery, may not wish to increase their consumption even further. This Is the reason why Cadbury's, Britain's leading manufacturer In this field, have decided that future growth must he expected to come in fields outside the traditional moulded chocolate bar businegs they know so well.

   "text_content" : "ByvOai. wan SSrset & ng - IN CONTRAST to the previou week, stocks this week gave ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost Z3.33 to 790.97, which igluded a fall of 12.42 on Wed- nesday. Volume, however, was distinctly on the light side. with 'the economic news mixed. The week began with word that the index of industril production for August was up to 158.3 (of the 1957-59 average after seasonal adjustment) from 157.4 in July. However, most economists view this indicator as a coincidental one -it describes what business activity is like at the present and, therefore, is of little use as a forecasting tool. * A more important indicator, new factory orders for durable goods, was down 4.5 from July, at a seasonally adjusted rate of 523,100m. Similarly, construction spending in August declined from the previous month's level and housing starts continued their long downward trend. These indicators are considered to be leading fore- casters of future economic activity. and may have depressed stock prices. Also disturbing to Wall Street was the indication by President Johnson that the Treasury would have to borrow S8,000m. of new cash by the end of the year. A good portion of this money the Administration hopes to finance through savings to further the fight against inflation. Short in- terest on the New York Stock Exchange rose to a new .record -level of: 12m. shares, the- fourth monthly increase in this technical indicator. Car Prices Raised Ford's announcement of price increases for 1967 models was followed quickly by similar in- creases on the part of Chrysler and General Motors. However, car shares changed little.. An article in a leading flnancial weekly which stressed the build-up in the capacity of synthetic fibres de- pressed companies in that field, which already had been under pres- sure for several months. Du Pont, Monsanto and Celanese, leaders in synthetics, were particularly weak. Individual features included Fairchild Camera, which were lower despite a denial that its Sep- tember quarter earnings would trail the previous year, although admitted that the third quarter would be less than the second quarter. Other high fliers such as Xerox, Motorola, SCM and Polaroid slipped lower.",

   "text_content" : "PARIS-The market recovered somewhat on Friday after drifting lower. The daily official bourse index reached a 1966 low. with monthly settlement operations a depressing feature. Selling pres- sure was limited, but there was no sustained buying evident. The late recovery reflected institutional and private buying for the new ac- count, but most issues showed losses. CSF closed at Frs.141 (against Sis.147.50). Pechiney at Frs.192 (Frs.200), Machines Bull Frs.137 (Frs.142.50), CGE at Frs.517 (Frs.529) and CFP at Frs.165.10 (Frs.162). Usinor dipped to Frs.82.50 (Frs.84.90), Ugine to Frs.191 (Frs.197) and Beghin Frs.225 (Frs.247). MILAN-The market moved higher at the start of the new bourse account. Final average gains were around 2 per cent., after a technical reaction at the end of the previous account. Leading issues were generally firm, with Montecatini at lire 1.866 (against lire 1,835 a week earlier), following Shell confirmation that it is withdrawing from the Monte- shell joint company. Edison closed at lire 2,899 (lire 2.831). Snia Viscosa lire 4,440 (lire 4,286), Flat lire 2,824 (lire 2.764) and Olivetti Preference lire 3,405 (lire 3.290). Secondary issues showed some wider gains. FRANKFURT -The market was generally strong. Good acceptance of a Siemens one-for- seven rights issue was a stimulant, and most sections showed gains. Chemicals and some car issues led the market higher. Siemens itself was resistant, losing only 19 points over the week to 369, despite the rights issue. Bayer rose 10 points to 317, and BASS and Hoechst 5 points each to 417% and 430 respectively. Volkswagen rose 18% to 416% and Dalmler rose 20 to 490. NSU dropped 9 to 356. Specialities con- tinued to move widely, with Deguma up 19 to 487. Metal- gesellsehaft up 21 to 500 and Schering up 11 to 400. Engineer- ing issues tended to rise. but Steels showed little change. ZURICH-The market finished steadier, after easing earlier in line with Wall Street. Company news affected individual shares, with lnterhqndel down Sw.Frs.90 at Sw.Frs.4.830. after last week's Bankgesellschaft share exchange offer. Barkgesellschaft was off Sw.Frs.50 at Sw.Frs.2.440. Elektro-watt lost Sw.Frs.25 to Sw.Frs.l,140 after declaring an un- changed dividend for the 1965-66 financial year. Italo-Suisse drew some speculative demand, on divi- dend expectations and hopes of a possible merger with a leading bank, closing down Sw.Frs.3 finally at Sw.Frs.237. Amsterdam-The market was mixed, but internationals tended lower despite a Friday recovery. Royal Dutch closed up SI.3.95. at F1.125.10, aided by its higher in- terim dividend. Other issues were affected by Wall Street's weakness, and some American selling, especi- ally Unilever and Philips. Unilever lost F1.2.15 to F1.8S.15 and Philips dropped F1;2.85 to Fl.90.55. Aku dipped 95 cents to SI.65.90. Hoogovens closed down 15 points at 330. KLM rose SI.10 to SI.510 refleting the shares' per- formance on Wall Street. 1\"~-\"",

The outstanding feature in Stock Markets yesterday was the late jump in prices towards the close when news came of Mr. Ian Smith's optimistic remark about seeing the end of the UDI dispute. After being 0.9 up at 2.45 p.m., THr FANCIAL TIes Industrial Ordinary share index was finally 2.0 up at 306.1, and ended the week 0.5 up on balance. In a market generally short of stock, prices im- proved quite sharply in some cases, more particularly in those securities with obvious Rhodesian connec- tions,, and jobbers were covering short positions or quoting higher prices to buyers and inquirers. There was a little more business than on Thursday, but activity was still restrained by the imminence of Monday's Â£60m. ICI Loan stock offer. Markings were still well below average at 6,484, and, ex- cluding holiday periods, the week's total of 33,246 was the lowest since the 30,294 recorded in the week- ending December 6, 1957. British Funds continued to attract a fair amount I of , business and, while closing below the best, were still very firm on continued investment support. Prior to the Rhodesian news, equities were quietly firm undei the lead of Oils and Steels, the former on consideration of the interim reports from BP and Shell and the latter, where current values are up to 21.6 per cent. below compensation values, on national- isation hopes. The Oil and Steel subsections of the P.T.-Actuaries share indices rose 3.9 per cent. to 178.0 and 3 per cent. to 86.75 res- pectively. The Copper section rose 3 per cent. to 119.68. Of the F.T.-quoted stocks which changed 15 per cent. rose and 9 per cent. fell. \" Funds Remain Firm British Funds remained a very firm' market yesterday following the fresh burst of strength in the late trading on Thursday. Investment buyers, notably of mpdium-dated stocks, were again in evi ence at the start and, although prices eased back in places during the afternoon as interest slackened in front of the week-end. scattered further improvements of Vg and occasionally more were recorded. Exchequer 5 per cent., 1976-78. at 82+. showed an exceptional rise of , while Converion 6 per cent., 1972, moved up A more to 961.. Long- dated issues were little changed, but War Loan was A better, at 49J. Treasury 6* per cent., 1976, at 96J, shed 1 of the previous day's Jt gain. The outstanding feature of a firm Corporation market was the big turnover in the 71 per cent.

Barrow Hepburn Gale ended Is 4d up at 17s 6d, after touching 18s; the rise was accompanied by a revival of \"take-over\" talk.

Other leading Engineers were looking a little firmer. with Tube Investments and' Guest KeN both improving a few, pence to. 52s 9d and 44s 3d respectively. W. H.

Isxs were finally 3s 3d higher at 68s 9Pd, while Shel closed Is better at 37s lid, after 37s 3d bid. Brnnabs were also wanted and rose 3 3d to 57s 9d. Mining Shares Ralny First reports of an encouraging statement on the Rhodesian situation by Mr. lan Smith generated an imme- diate optimism during the later deal- ings in Central African Mining shares. After having marked time in idle conditions, 1rices of the Zambian issues moved up smartly with RST advancing to 65s before closing 4 up at 64s. 'Rhokana (42s), Nehanga (42s) and \"Zamanglo\" (58s) were around Is 94d up. The Rhodesian copper.producing MTD (Manla) jumped IOd to lls 114 and the gold-producing Globe and Phoenix gained Is to 20s. The reports came too late to affect the Cape market in South African Golds, but they reversed an earlier dull trend in London where prices consequently closed little the worst on balance.

Cling was substatial, while fresh' busial mremained scarce almost to the end. Repayments of loans taken from the Bank of Eng- land the previous day were among factors against houses' favour. A rate of 6# per cent. was bid for day-to-day loans for the best part, with 6* per cent. paid for money arlsins from official purchases of bills from the banks and also for other lines in certain instances in the last hour or so, in view of the re- sumption by the Bank of England on hursday of leding at 7 per cent. Towards the close, balances were obtained at levels down to 6 per cent Business in Treasury bills was small, if turnover due to the official help is set aside. December maturi- ties were quoted at 645-64ths per cent. before and after the tender, at which the market bid for 91-day bills was unchanged at Â£98 6e 3d.

Forward sterling showed little change-the 3-month discount widening the merest shade to a little over f cent.

   "text_content" : "-HIS YEAR there will be no -espite from the petrol comn anies' sales promotion cam- paans. Regent has announced that with effect from October 1 it will be giving away free Christmas cards at its stations In place of the T-shirts and \"bullet holes\" which it is die tributing at present. The campaign represents a break with the industry's usual practice. The normal pattern is .or campaigns to be launched either around Easter orWhitsun and to continue until about the middle of September when they are either formally withdrawn as in the case of Shell's \" Make Money \" competition, or allowed to run down gradually. The fact that Regent, the third largest company in the market. feels the need to carry on work- ing during the winter is partly a reflection of the more aggressive policy that has followed recent changes in its top management, but also shows once again how intense the battle for sales ha. become. The significant feature of the campaign is that it is designed to encourage motorists not only to go into Regent stations, but also to buy larger quantities when they do. At present th- vast majority of sales across the forecourt are for three gallons or less, and all the com. panies are anxious to inorease this gure ih order to make better use of the a.ttendant time. Accordingly Regent ft stipulatian that motorists will have to buy at least four gallons before they quality for their two free cards with envelpes. Then there will be a bonus of another free card plus envelope for each additional two gllons. Wisely the company has not put any advertising matter on the cards so that people ought not to feel diffident about usng them. There is little doubt that the campaign will succeed in its aim of selling more Regent petrol. As the success of trading stamp and the Shell \" Make Mone\" competition show motorists want to feel that they are getting something for nothing when they buy their petrol. They know that it is all alike, in the sense that their cars will run equally well on any brand so long as the right grade is chosen, and they know that the major brands all cost the same. So as ihere is no scope for finding a better bargain by going to another station the best thing to do Is to patronise the one that offers the best gimmicks. At Christmas time it is difficult to think of a better one than cards which everybody has to send and the price of which rises each year. In one way or ianther nearly all the big petrol companies have rp gi0v1way campaigns esigned to encourage brand loyalty this year, yet there is incresing uneasines in the in- ustry about this policy. On the one hand nobody can think of a better way of Increasing an individual company's share of the market, and a-good cam* a\"ign does this very effectively. Bt on the other they recognise that the campalgn tend to con. firm the popular view that petrol prices ought to come down, and that in any case they are out of keeping with the prevailing economic freeze situation. The senior executives know that what they are doing is bad for the industry's .image and that if they go too far they will risk the sort of Government intervention that has taken place over detergent advertising. But there is always the fear of what the other fellow may be doing, and the hope that one will find the winning formula oneself to spur them on. The only question is where do we go from here. This year the motorist has had the oppor- tunity of winning Â£100 from Shell. a dream house from Esso. and a vintage car from Mobil. And now the Christmas cards are for free. Finding a new attraction will not be easy.",

   "text_content" : "THE P AND 0 shipping group came in for a good deal of criticism from British unions in the middle of last year when it placed orders, worth about Â£6m., with Mitsui Shipbuilding, of Japan, for three fast cargo liners. Mr. Ted Hill, at that time leader of the Boilermakers' union, called the decision \"un- patriotic.\" P and O's defence was that Mitsui's offer combined the lowest price, the quickest de- livery and the least risk that completion dates would not be met. Mitsui has certainly carried out its side of 'the bar- gain: this week the first of the three 14,000-ton, 21-knot, ships -the Strathardle-was launched one month ahead of schedule. From keel laying to delivery, in January next year, the building of the ship will have taken only seven months, one month earlier than the promised delivery. By the middle of next year she will be joined by her sister-ships. Strathbrora and Strathconon. The arjument by P and 0 and by some other British ship- owners is' that their function is to capture and carry as much of the world's trade as they can. Their competitive ability is impaired if they do not build ships in the cheapest and most efficient market. It can be, and has .een, argued that British shippmg does not owe the British shipbuilding industry a living. Both industries are com- pletely open to world-wide competition. P and 0 must be congratulat- ing itself on its decision this week. On the same day of the launching in Japan another 21- knot cargo liner for Ben Line -a strong competitor of P and O on the Far East trade-was launched from the Clyde shipyard of Charles Connell seven months late. Sir Douglas Thomson, chair- man of Ben Line. expressed his concern over the delayed delivery, paraphrasing the \" and O argument: \"Appar- ently ships built in Japan are a mere three or four weeks late. This is extremely disturbing, as if this sort of thing seeps right through industry, we face indus- An artist's impresion of the P & 0 fast cargo liner, Strathardle, launched this week in Japan and due for delivery next January. trial defeat from our overseas competitors.\" The need by P and O for its new cargo ships to be delivered quickly and on time is based on the fact that it has been falling badly behind British and foreign competitors on the route-at least in terms of fast ships. While the fastest P and 0 cargo liners on the Far Eastern route have been 17-knot vessels, the Blue Funnel group and Ben Line have been operating 21- knot ships for some time. P and O's happy experience so far with Japanese shipyards will obviously lead to the inclusion of Japan in any tenders the group will seek eventually for the building of fast container ships for operation on the Europe to Australia and Far East trades.",

   "text_content" : "The 54th annual general meeting of The Attock Oil Company Limited was held on September 23 in London. MR. A. McOILVRAY (the chairman) presiding. The following is an extract from bis circulated statement: * Production of crude oil by the Parent Company increased by 4 per cent, to 2,501.544 barrels in 1965 compared with 2,405,324 barrels in 1964. This was largely due to the temporarily Increaed production in September last year to meet the Pakistan national emergency. Any increase in profit which might have been expected to accrue was offset by the addl. tional taxes and compulsory war damage insurance arising out of the emergency and lower returns generally on products sold throughout the year. At Slat December, 1965, Current Assets were Â£4.698,394 and Current Liabilities Â£2,474,702. giving a surplus of Â£2,223,602, compared with Â£1.946.792 at 31st Decemrber 1964, Capital xpenditure for the year was f81,999 compared with Â£73,807 for 1964, Production of the Subsidiary Company, Pakistan Olifleld .Imlted-f\" P.O.L. \") was 4.19,656 Sarrel compared with 370.577 brrels for 1964, Wth reference to that part of Sirectors' Report concermin 1e rpayment by kistan Ollfe1ik Limited of piet drilling expondl, ture Incurred on their Dhullan area consequent on commercial prpdzoilon beig1 proved there, It Wi I l not'd thatthe sum repaid was Â£649,77, wherea in my ltatement al year I mentloed would be of the order of !I millo.

Tax) now. relief is limited to the rate of Cor- poration Tax. Income Tax at Ss. 3d. in the Â£ will have to be de- ducted from the Final Dividend on this occasion and paid over by the Company to the Inland Revenue. However, under the transitional arrangements prescribed by the Finance Act, 1965. the Company will be granted what is commonly known as \"overspill\" relief which is an allowance to compensate for the reduced relief in respect of the overseas taxation. This allowance, as recorded in my last year's State. ment, is to be spread over seven years with the greatest benefit reo ceivable In respect of the early years but reducing to no allowance at all after seven years. It is estli mated that the whole of the income tax payable on the Final Dividend for the year ended 31st December, 1965. will be offset by the \"over- spill ' relief available to your Com- pany. After reviewing the operations at the various fields, the Chairman continued: The Refinery Throughput for the year was 3,416,774 barrels against 3,244.104 barrels last year. Of this through. put, 500.880 barrels were on account of Pakistan Petroleum Limited and 412,806 barrels were on account of P.O.L.; the re- mainder of the crude oil belonged to your Company. This through. put is an all time record and is again due to the Emergency in September, 1965, during which time the Refinery handled over 2,000 tons of crude oil a day. Consider- ina the site of the Plant, that a strict black-out was in sores throughout this period and work. In conditions s a consequenve were very difficult, this Is a remark- able achievement which refleots great credit on all the Staff con. corned. Nevertheless we must be truly thankful from all points of view that the Emergency was of com. paratively short duration, Produc- tion of crude oil for sustained periods at a rate above the optimum set by experience of Reservoir conditions is most likely to be injurious to ultimate recovery and, consequently, wasteful.

   "text_content" : "T.A srAKrU pnces nave b0en edging down again, and the con- tinuing run of poor results from North ndian producers is doing little-to help the situation. The latest two companies to reveal the extent of the damage last year are Assam Frontier and Assam and African. The average price for Assam teas last season ended up at SS.38d per pound against SS.87d the season before. This only compounded the effect of lower crops, and that profits would be down as a result was clear enough. Not Covered In Assam Fronter's case the crop was 7 per cent. lower and profits have slumped from Â£232.000 to Â£85,000 before tax. After an enormous - 86 per cent. - tax charge the gross Preference divi- dend is not even covered, but over- spill of Â£18,500 comes to a partial rescue, leaving earnings at 1.75 per cent. However, thanks to paying some of the Preference net and a Â£60,000 adjustment from previous years (unexplained) a dividend of sorts has survived, though at .7 per cent. it is half the previous rate. The share price has dropped from 16s to I Is 9d where yield is only 13.8 per cent. With Assam prices off to a bad start this sea. s6n the share price is going to be easily disappointed. Assam and Afritan is in an equally poor state. Its total out. put was 6 pet cent. down, and profits, before tax but excluding adjustments, are down from Â£684,000 to Â£258,000. Thus against Assam Frontier's drop in margins from 3%d to 1.4d per pound pre- tax, Assam and African's global margins have shrunk from 5.3d to 2.13d per pound. A and A also has a giant-sized tax charge-84 per cent.-and earnings emerge at under I per cent., but again thanks to adjustments the dividend is cut from 10 only to 6 per cent. The share price has come down this week from' 8s 3d to 7s 9d. where yield is 15.5 per cent. This is a bit more like it, but hardly compelling when there are so many unanswered questions. What, for instance, is Assam and African's overspill relief, how will devalua. tlon really affect it, and re theft any grounds for hoping the dividend can be held this year? Jorgnhut' report and account: do little to answer the same Iuestlons hanging over its future. t least its overpill relief is knownk but at Â£9,400, just over a point to earnings, this. is hardly oinsg to bale the company out of its problems-and there is no mention of whether this figure will be different in the current year. Repaying the Preference next year will help, of course, but this is worth less than a point to earn- ings. So Jorehaut is left with margins cut last year from 2.26d pre-tax to 1.03d. in little shape to stand up to any more knocks. Thus the chairman's warnings that the full effects of higher taxation, up five points to 70 per cent., the export tax and devaluation will not be seen until the 1966 tesults are published is all the more dis- couraging. At least the Board is trying with some claimed success to cut estate costs. The Questions The Western Dooars report is similarly vague on its future. Though its marketing performance last year was a good one, with prices actually up by Id a pound, well against the trend, this did not stop a drop in profits and the divi- dend, thanks to a jump in wages and taxation. It is presumably un- reasonable to assume the group can continue to buck the price. trend this year-and Dooars' price are nearly 4d a pound lower, more than the group's pre-tax mar- gins last year. Secondly, overspill relief of Â£35,000 adds just over 3 points to earnings, but there is no mention of whether this level will change in the current year. It is true, forecasting so early in the season is hardly possible, but until companies give some in- dication of the effects of devalua tion-even on the previous year's figures-or the expected movement of overspill relief, the average 15.5 per cent. yield on teas looks to be tuned too much to hopes that the unit trusts will be back in the mar- ket, and too little to the way crops and prices so far indicate another difficult season.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR MINING EDITOR IP THEY have done litte else this week, South African Gold shaes have at least shown that the are capable of coming to life whenever theare aresign of a break in the political clouds. After having'drifted lower in idle dealings, prices revived smartly on Thursday simply because the new premier's speech was mild in tone. And despite the market's 1ecent weakness, the Con. solidated Gold Field' Â£5.6m. rights issue has achieved a remarkable 94 per cent. suc- cess. Admittedly, this group is now international but it is still in part dependent on extensive South African interests. Clearly, potential buyers of Golds are becoming increas- ingly tempted by the low price levels and -the market has the look of one wanting to go better. More and More Expansion Unlimited, might well be a suitable synonym for South Africa's big platinum pro- ducer, Rustenburg. At times in the past it seemed that rather too much emphasis was being placed on expansion, especially when the platinum market be- came flooded with Soviet sup- plies in the early 1960's. This sow of metal suddenly halted at the end of 1963 and has not been resumed since, the Rus- sians presumably needing all their platinum for industrial purposes. So Rustenburg has further boosted production in order to meet the expanding demands of consumers while maintaining stable prices in the face of much higher quotations on the free market. The last expansion, designed to boost output by about 40 per cent., was com- pleted in March this year and the producer is already in the throes of a further crash pro- gramme which should have full impact in the second-half of 1967. But demand continues to run ahead of supply. And this week Rustenburg has announced yet another expansion programme scheduled for completion in the second half of 1968 which will give the voracious market more metal in the following year. It will cost some Â£1lm. over the years to August, 1970, of which Â£7.5m. will be spent in the next two years. Output Target The effect of Rustenburg's new era, which started after Soviet supplies faded out in 1963, will bring annual produc- tion up from 200,000 ounces a year at that time to 750,000 ounces when the latest pro- gramme is completed. If sales run as expected Rustenburg will be able to make modest in- creases in dividends as well as financing the expansion costs from profits and short-term loans. If. on the other hand. the market does not live up to its present promise-Soviet sup- plies could return, for instance -dividends may, at least, be maintainable at current levels. And Rustenburg would have the capacity to build up-stocks as a cushion for any later up- swing in this often unpredict- able market. Over the years, Rustenburg's continued expansion may have held a weary \"jam to-morrow\" dividend aspect for shareholders in the holding companies. Potgieterrust. Waterval and Union Platinum. But share prices of all three have marched steadily forward and are cur- rently not far from record highs, despite yesterday's set- back on disappointment with the unchanged dividends. Pot- gietersrust being now 56s 3d compared with a 1963 low of a mere 8s 6d. New Life In Ireland, moves are afoot to bring to life again the St. Patrick's copper mine in the lovely vale of Avoca among Wicklow's mountains. As if in punishment for the inevitable scar created amid this scenery, the mine previously brought heavy losses including about Â£2m. for the Irish Government which was the chief creditor. Largely because of technical problems, the mine closed down in September, 1962, and ever since then the Irish Government has been hoping to cut its losses by selling the property to someone else. At that time copper was fetching only about Â£234 a ton cqm. pared with over Â£400 to-day and much higher prices in recent months. So it is not altogether sur- prising that an international consortium of companies is now thinking of having another go at making the mine pay. An option to purchase its assets has been granted to a group under the heading of Avoca Mines which consists of Canadian Superior Exploration, Germany's Metallgesellschaft and the successful Canadian Northgate group members, Tara Exploration, Gorldrum and Irish Base Metals. The last- named is the Irish subsidiary which owns the flourishing Tynagh lead-zinc copper mine in Galway. Geevor Search Busily looking, with Union Corporation, for a new lease of life is Cornwall's Geevor tin producer. One important aspect of the joint search for new ore reserves, is in the old neigh. bouring Levant mine. Opera- tions here depend.,: on the successful sealing of the breach in undersea workings and steady progress is being made. Going it alone in 'the other adjoining Boscaswell area, Geevor is finding \"highly satis- factory\" results on the Simms lode and has been able to announce this week a better than expected increase in ore reserves. Meanwhile, produc- tion is keeping in front of the 1964-65' rate and this should help to offset the probability of a rather lower average tin price for the current 12 months, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The legal position is that if the will does not, having regard to all the circumstances, make \"reasonable provision\" for the widow, the Court can order reasonable provision to be made out of the (in the case of an estate of over Â£5,000) income of the estate. The matter there- fore lies in the discretion of the Court, according to'all the facts of the case, and the sole \"right\" of the widow is to have the discretion properly exercised. BETTER TITLE A piece of ground clow to my home has been feneed.-o by a near nelbour presmably with a view to claim a his own when 12 years have elaped. As it has not been possible to determine the ownership of the land what if anytbalx can be done to prevent bln (a) from uaing It now or (b) from laying a claim In 12 years' time? Nothing can be done if you are not the owner of the land, because, by enclosing the land, he has given himself a title to the land which is certainly better than any title you may have. If. on the contrary, you have got a title, you can then sue for possession forthwith. AN INTESTACY I ad my dauhter are the only survivin relativ of my ,1- ter, who ha died htttete. Can I dlsdal any share in the estate, and if so, would it paM to my daughter, and would; the estate be agre- gate*tto mine if I ailed to survive for 'fe years CuMl my husband. be appolited administratorw ? The effect of a disclaimer in the circumstances you mention is far from clear, and, far from carrying the estate to your daughter, it may carry it to the Crown as bona vacandia. We would therefore advise you to assign the estate to your daughter rather than to execute a disclaimer. We' hink, that thereis no difference in th duty No legal rpoulMdbUty can be accepted by TbÂ« Feadcial TIm.e for tbhe anwrn givrmn t hee colamE & Al aquiries will be answered by pos.- No charge bi nade for this pervice. result if you were to die within five years-namely that duty would be claimed, as a right has been extinguished at your ex- pense. There are certain cases where the Crown does not claim duty on a disclaimer (notwith- standing that it theoretically can), but this is not one of them. Having made the assignment, your daughter will herself be the first person entitled to the grant; if she is a minor, then a grant can be made to her father on her behalf. REMAINDERMEN'S In i case where a wife has a life Interet la her husband's estate, the remaludsame beainnephews and ncesa, do boii tinu and rlt hrroti to to the wife so tt she cm 1d we of tben by will No, they do not go to the wife.. The bonus shares simply represent an accretion to capital, without anything more. and they go automatically with the re- mainder of the capital to the nephews and nieces. As regards the \" rights\" issues, the widow has had to spend money to. take up these shares, and-unless the trustees have op each occasion simply indicated that they were not going to take them up and could not sell them (in which case the shares might belong to the widow absolutely)-she or her estate will be entitled to be re- couped these moneys, with in- terest from the date of her death until paid. But subject to such payment, the right shares will also form part of the capital which will pass to the nephews and nieces. MORTGAGOR i wat to sell a bouse d owin to the preenat a tringecy am thinking of beeliomg Ike moalgqoriiy- self. Do you me any diflcul. ties i doing thb and If not a ca you ay bow I houl proceed and bow the Interest and capital repayments should be assesd and apportioned? No, it frequently happens that a vendor takes a substantial part of the purchase price by way of mortgage in order to facilitate a sale. The question of interest and capital repayments is, we think, best dealt with in the case of a private bargain by making the capital repayable by so many instalments together with inter- est on the outstanding balance of the mortgage money, rather than by attempting to fix a simple lump sum payable for a fixed number of years. We think that this leads to more difficulties than the formula which we have suggested. AN ASSENT Could you let me know the chdepert way by which I. - executor, can pa a house to the testator's daughtert The way to pass the title to the daughtpr is by means of an assent (no stamp). The form given in the Law of Property Act, 1925. should be followed as closely as possible. It runs: \"I A.B. of (address) as the per- sonal representative of X.Y. late of (address) deceased do this day of '19... hereby as personal representative assent to the vesting in C.D. of (address) of [describe property] for all the estate or interest of the said X.Y. at the time of his/ her death. As witness the hand of the said A.B. the day and year first above written. A.B. (Signature).' A LICENCE At my seighbour's suggestion, whose access to his garage was eased thereby, I removed a wire fence of mine which had become dilapidated. Is there a risk of my neighbour acquiring a right of way and preventing my putting up a fence again, if I so wish ? We think that if the existing state of affairs eontinued for a' period of 20 years, you would find it impossible to re.erect the wire fence. The way to safe- guard the position is to have your neighbour sign a docu- ment-as simple as you please -that he enjoys any rights over your land by virtue of your leave and licence, which is to be revocable at any time. Provided that you get him to sign this every 15 (to be on the safe side) years or so, you need not fear that your position will be in any way adversely affected. DUTY LIABILITY Is t correct that the survivor In the case of a joint house is liable to pay duty on it? If so, how can I avoid this happening by my will? Yes. this is correct because the estate duty on real property (land and houses) is a charge on that property. You can avoid the same thing happening in your estate by a direction in your -will that any estate duty on any real property passing or deemed to pass on your death is to be paid out of your free personal estate.

   "text_content" : "Office equipment companies have been excluded from the new cash grants and some sec- tions of the business are experi. encing a price war due to the abolition of RPM. But the industry is better placed than most .in this difficult economic period. Exports for the first six months of 1966 have risen 54 per cent. to Â£41.4m. and foreign demand is growing all the time. With SET bearing heavily on the service industries and employers looking more to mechanisation, home sales should keep up v ith the over- seas performance. This puts Ozalid in an attrac- tive liht. It has a big spread in office equipment ranging from sensitised paper for docu- ment copying to office -.achi- nery. In the photographic divi- sion there is a- new highly advanced coating machine where considerable progress is envis- aged. More than 30 per cent. of group sales are in oversc\" markets-although 14 per cent. are accounted for in Central and South Africa-and exports to the USSR are gathering pace. Ozalid has a striking record and 1965 did nothing to spoil it. Turnover reached record levels and pre-tax profits climbed a further 10 per cent. to Â£1.7m. The actual progress made. however, was concealed by exceptionally high research and development charges of Â£667,000, being Â£120,000 up on 1965. But the interesting point now is that R and D is due to drop to an annual Â£300,000, which is worth a few points to earnings. Thus. with first-half pre-tax profits for 1966 up from Â£880,000 to Â£938,000, results for the full year could be in the region of Â£2.0m. (allowing for the reduced R and D charge). Taking a similar tax charge as last year (including overseas tax but not taking credit for over. spill) and excluding investment allowance relief earnings on capital enlarged by a one-for-12 rights issue last January, could be 32 per cent. to cover the 23 per cent. dividend 1.5 times. This gives a projected P/E ratio of 11 at 19s 6d. Finances are in fair shape and the proposal to raise the autho- rised equity capital by 24 per cent. is a confident gesture for expansion. The shares yielding 5.9 per cent. look as if they should be nearer to this year's high of 25s.",

Will this mean a larger share of the market for Stan- dard Fireworks? It should do but hopes must not be raised too high yet awhile. However, there are grounds for optimism.

The group has recently turned n pre-tax profits 22% per cent. Lp at Â£209.000 and raised the dividend 3 points to 30 per cent. despite the -freeze (but after dividend waivers). Finances are n good shape and expansion is being pushed ahead.

Operating as a furnisher, draper, outfitter and check rader in Hull Cattles Holdians is vulnerable to the squeeze. However, the group has bene- its to come from an acquisition and it is optimistic about first half profit of the current year. Credit trading constitutes 50 per cent. of turnover and' profits, this continues to expand. SET has to be reckoned with and here is a fair sized overdraft. But the record is good and the 6.1 per cent. yield and 11.0 P/E atio at 4s 9d is a fair rating * * * An Australian investment company ? London Australian Invest. ment Company's SAl stock units are traded in London under rule 163(l)(e) at Ils 9d and yield 3.7 per cent. The ecord is good and the portfolio well spread. The three largest investment sections arc Food and Tobacco 10.8 per cent., Banks. H.P., and Finance 9.2 per cent. and Breweries 8.8 per cent.

Using Gibraltar as a touring base This could happen in the case of Gibraltar and Southern Spain. The traveller could make the Rock his base for a fort- night or longer, keeping his limited currency for a short stay in Algeciras where the weather is usually really warm until the end of October and where even the winter is mild and sunny by British standards. This is where the Reina Cristina Hotel, one of the finest establishments in the whole of Spain, is located and which, incidentally, happens to be wholly British-owned. Indeed. since the Trust Houses group took over this hotel some three years ago, it has spent a con- siderable sum in modernising the south wing by the addition of new bedrooms and private bathrooms, and m -ntainng the whole establishment in first- class condition.. The new currency regulations could, therefore, be something of a blow to what 'has now come to be regarded as a \"British Castle in Sunny Spain.\" especially as up to now some 40 per cent. of its visitors have come from the United Kingdom.

   "text_content" : "By A. G. L HELLYER Editor of Amateur Gardening COMMERCIAL fruit growers have long known that if an orchard is grubbed and replanted with the same kind of fruit the young trees do -not grow away so well as they would on similar soil that had not previously been used for that kind of fruit. Put more specifically, apples do not follow well after apples, nor plums after plums, nor yet cherries after cherries, though no trouble occurs if apples follow, cherries, plums follow apples,.and so on. There have been many attempts at explanation, none very con. clusive. Some growers thought that it was due to extraction of particular elements in the soil peculiarly necessary for each different kind of fruit, but no amount of manuring seemed to rectify the trouble. Another theory was that fruit trees excreted something into the soil which was poisonous to their own kind but not to other kinds of fruit tree. No such poison was ever shown to exist. Diseases in Soil Now, as a result of work at the East Mailing Research Station, it seems certain that retarded growth of this kind is due to specific diseases left behind in the soil The germs of the various diseases (there must be separate ones for each kind of fruit) have not yet been isolated, still less identified, but proof of their existence lies in the fact that the-whole trouble can be eliminated by fumigating the soil with chloropicrin. Last week I went to East Mailing to see some of the results of this work and I have rarely seen such a convincing demonstration. In one field an old apple orchard had been grubbed and part of it has been replanted with young apple trees and apple root stocks. Prior to planting, six foot squares of soil had been treated with chloropicrin for some of the trees, while other identical trees had been planted on untreated soil or soil treated with other chemicals. Without excep- tion the trees on the .chloropicrin treated soil had grown very well, whereas those on the untreated soil were retarded. Another field had been a cherry orchard and part of it has been re- planted with young cherries. Here alternate strips had been treated with chloropicrin. with untreated strips between, and there was the same startling difference in growth. However, the matter does not aed there. It as clear that the\" diseases, whatever they may be. ae only capable of retarding rowth when the tree is already checkedi. as a reslt of t~nsplantiog. Once it is re-stablished it is able to grow quite nonall, though i s un- likely toh a up wit an initially unchecked fr6. since growth pro- ceeds by a ptogression not unlike compound interest, and so the bad starter gets left progressively fau ther behind Dangerous Chemical But since it is only the first year that trouble occurs, and since the diseases do not appear to move about rapidly in the soil, the same effect as that produced by chloropicrin can be obtained by replacmg the soil for each young tree in an area of about six feet square and a foot deep. This will give the tree enough clean soil to get it established without check from transplanting diseases and by the second year, when it may start to root out into infected soil, it will be able to look after itself. For the commercial grower the labour of carting this quantity of fresh soil for hundreds of trees might be prohibitive but in a gar- den it should present no great Problem. Chloropicrin is a dangerous chemical to handle. It will almost certainly never be made available to amateur gardeners though it seems probable that skilled operators will be permitted to apply it in commercial orchards. But there is nothing to prevent anyone from importing fresh soil. and since only enough is needed for the area the roots are likely to penetrate the first year it is in no way impracticable. Clean Start At East Mailing only commecial fruit crops are studied but it seems nrobable that other plans, includ ing ornamental trees and shrubs, are affected by replanting diseases of a similar kind. In the absence' of positive evidence to the con- trary it would certainly seem wis= to assume that this is so and, when replacing trees or shrubs with similar kinds, to import some fresh soil to give the new plants a clean Start Since the replant diseases can only injure plants that are suffer- ing a check through being trans- planted, it is possible that con- tainer-grown plants, moved without appreciable root injury. might escape with less damage than those that had been dug up from the open ground. I do not know of any work done to prove whether this is correct, but it would seem worthy of investigation.",

   "text_content" : "A~J~~ 1'~'OD'.tER*~ The second Kirov mixed bill consists of an act of La Bayedlre and an act of Gayane, and 'inally after the concert-party numbers, the Valse de Flours and grand pas de deux of The Nutcracker; It makes an interesting programme, provid- ing an historical survey of Lenin' grad idioms over half a century. La Bayadere. is a Petipa ballet of 1877, with a Minkuascore; and, what we.saw of it was the scene in the Kingdom of Shades, where the hero dances briefly with the spirit of his murdered beloved. Gorgeous arpeggios swirl from the harp, and from the darkness there emerge, one after the other, the beautiful shades, in arabesque after arabesque until 32 of them have illed the stage. But there is no need to describe thepiece; it is the reper- tory of the Royal Ballet. revived for them by Nureyev. That per- formance, however, does not achieve the glamour and magic of the Kirov's last night. This Petipa style is in their bodies. Their deep arabesques are marvels of beauty. This Bayad&re scene is unre- formed ballet at its most unrepen- tant, purely formal, an historical exercise in style and -technique, expressing no human.emotions. but lovingly preserved because it is beautiful in itself. Fedicheva was the ballerina, tall, arrow-true, im- perial in extension and elevation, presenting the choreography with every detail sharp. Vikulov. the most romantic of the Kirov danseurs, surely needs no British critics to tell him that his feet are untidy; he carries off the part with personality, with his elastic grace and vigour, but not the technical perfection which we have come to expect. Gayane (1942) is, to judge by the excerpts we have been shown, an interesting attempt to fuse national idioms with the Franco- Italian Maryinsky school. Its creator, Aninsimova, was Lenin- grad-trained, but then danced in the Ukraine for several years before joining the Kirov com- pany. The fourth act of Gayane, as of The Sleeping Beauty, is a wedding celebration, a string of dancers. Petipa regularly intro* duced national divertissements, but his Spanish, Neapolitan or gypsy numbers were a long way removed from folk origins, thoroughly formalised. Aninsimova's dances, however, have their direct inspiratiod in folk movement; at the same -time she draws on the pirouettes and double-turns and whole apparatus of Maryinsky technique. The result, aided by Khachaturian's brash, lively score, -sI extraordin-.. arily exhilarating; and the company dance it with verve, brilliance and infectious high spirits.. ,..... Vainonen, also Leningrad- trained, was one of the. first Soviet choreographers. .What we haw seen of his work suggests an applij cation of the old. romantic lan- guage to new socialist themes.

   "text_content" : "The Oxford Play1house Compay I begins its tenth anniversary season % with Joason's Volpon, .a rich, t plucake of comedy that ouht o be seen much more.oftn, Itas I full of good rts, and, Very economically constructe,' with nothing to. ditract the attention. I from the main plot, the tricking of 1 the trickster Volpone by his I double-sealidi servant, and the in; evitable unmasking both of these . two and of all the unattractive 1 people who had hoped to make i profit out of them by one means I or another. In fact, in Frank Hauser's pro-* duction here, it is more economical than usual, as Mr, Hauser has i written out the character of Sir Politick Would-Be and his unneces- sary sub-plot, though Lady Would- Be, who is more vital to the story, has to remain-rumbustiously played by Nan Munro. This is a typical Frank Hauser production, free of gimmicks but highly inventive, and very sensitive to every overtone of the text, and it is excellently cast. Volpone is played by Leo McKern, who deals equally easily with the broadest comedy and the most musical verse. (To my mind, Jonson is the only playwright of this period. Marlowe excepted;,who can write verse to hold a candle to Shakespeare's. Mr. McKern can fill the house with hi-s personality when he is prone under a bearkin rug by the leas twitch of his face-msles; he can * like thund, and sing a love so, like .1 oet. A grand pferfo Mosc his sly Figaro. is played by Alan Ddbie in a dark mood that provides a useful contrast to the prevailing hilarity. Bob Hornery as Voltore, James Grout as Corbaccio, and Leonard Rossiter as Corvino make a splendid trio of villains, Mr. ossiter especially, who finds more scope for subtlety in his part, and sometimes takes it in a pleasingly unexpected manner, as when he addresses his wife with the words \"Celia, I shall grow violent I\" in terms of honeyed cajolery. Among the bizarre retainers in Volpones household there is a wistful Dwarf, played by Lindsay Kemp with uncommon charm. The opulent but simple set by Hutchinson Scott enables the action to race ahead without a pause, and Mr. Hauser has packed the even ing with amusing ideas. As it happens, I have never seen this play on the stage before, and I'd no idea it was going to turn out so funny. It's cynical, earthy air it just the thing to match the mood of swinging Britain in the 1960s. It's worth making quite a journey to Oxford to catch it.",

   "text_content" : "Tourneur's famous 17th century drama The Revenger's Tragedy has its first professional staging in England for nearly 300 years on October 5, when it joins the reper- toire at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. It is the sixth and final production of the 1966 Stratford- upon-Avon season. Tourneur, a contemporary of Shakespeare, is thought in this play to have been influenced by Hamlet, already in the Stratford repertoire, and The Revenger's Tragedy is added to the season as a second example of the Jacobean revenge plays of which Hamlet is the peak. Fellini cuts a film for De Laurentiis Dino de Laurentiis Productions has cancelled the film II Viaggio di G. Mastorna (The Journey of G. Mastorna) because director Fed- erico Fellini has abandoned it, reports Reuter from Rome. De Laurentiis is taking legal action against the prize-winning director, the company stated. The scrapping of the film, after a year's preparation and only a few days before shooting was to begin, cost the commpany 600m. lire (about Â£345,000). Signor Fellini later admitted that he and Signor de Laurentifs had agreed 'to halt the film, but described the announcement itself PI \" iihredtibll'\" as . \" M .... A further link between the two plays is that the present setting for Hamlet has been adapted to stage The Revenger's Tragedy. The central role of Vendice will be played by Ian Richardson. Brenda Bruce, who has played comedy roles for the RSC in London, makes her Stratford debut as the Duchess. Patience Collier, currently in Tango and The Meteor at the Aldwych, plays Gratiana. The Revenger's Tragedy will be given only eight performances in the present Stratford season. It is directed by Trevor Nunn. The designer is Christopher Morley. The music is by Guy Woolfenden. Jacqueline du Pre indisposed Owing to the indispbsition of lacqueline du Pre, who was to have appeared as soloist at the opening of the Scottish National Orchestra's season in Edinburgh and Glasgow on October 7 and 8, her place will be taken by the French 'cellist, Andr6 Navarra. The programme. which includes Elgar's Cello Concerto, is un- altered. National Gallery's new Trustee Sir John Summerson, the art historian, has been appointed a trustee of the National Gallery, in succession to Sir Geoffrei Keynes.",

I tried the blanket myself by wetting it, washing it, trying to burn it with cigarettes and subjecting it to quite a lot of tough treatment. This is a new type of blanket in that no elements are used. The fluffy Acrilan blanket has two zipped pockets to hold \"infra-Kinetic\" heating pads made from an ICI silicone conducting material which gives the blanket about a ten- minute warm-up. A low-voltage blanket that does not overheat, is fireproof and guaranteed for five years, the \"Test-o-Therm\" is also washable -remove the pads before putting it into the machine or tub and treat it as you would ordinary Acrilan blankets. It was invented by an electronics engineer who hit upon the system by accident during research. Described by a Home Safety Organiser for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Acci. dents as a \"very sophisticated product of first-class material and workmanship,\" it is made in pink, green, blue, yellow or red-single size (19 guineas), three-quarter size (23 guineas) and double size (25 guineas). The 25-volt heating pads are connected to the mains via a bedside transformer. The pro- moters have all sorts of ideas about keeping young or invalid animals and forced plants warm, but I should add that it also works ad- mirably on beds (household indoor variety).

   "text_content" : "EVERY DAY now brings new signs that the squeeze is begin ning to bite. But to find out just how much economic activity will slow down the Government and the public will, for the time being, just have to sit back and wait. The latest economic indicators afford no reliable guide. The industrial production index, after having declined steadily from the peak reached in March, moved up two points in July. It is likely, however, that this was merely a distortion produced by the seamen's strike. Particularly in light engineering, output is measured by actual deliveries. Many companies evidently found some difficulties in shipping their products in June. In July the goods held up went out. Pro duction, though, was almost cer tainly running level in the two months. Wat the figures do show 'is that under external pressure the Government Was forced to take violent defla- tionary action at a time when industrial output was already on a slight downward trend. The unemployment figure, provide further confirmation of this. It is now clear that the turnabout in the labour market came in May, and in the last month the underlying trend has accelerated sharply. Between August and September the num- ber of wholly unemployed, ex- cluding school-leavers, rose to 307,000. The actual increase of over 33,000 was some 25,000 larger than the normal seasonal rise. The count, moreover, was taken before the latest announce- ments of redundancies have be- come effective. What is showing up in the statistics at the moment are numerous small changes in employment spread over the whole country. Cars and Componenm So far attention has been con- centrated on what has been happening in the car and motor components industry and in con- duner durables. As regards cars, it should be remembered that for a variety of reasons-of which fear of what the Chancellor might do in the Budget was un doubtedly an important one- the seasonal trend in car sales has in any case been more marked in recent years. After a reasonably good first half of the year, the car manufacturers were anticipating a fairly sharp fall in demand in the second half. The restrictions have not merely de- pressed demand further but have also lessened the need to stock up for the spring. Producers of the large: domestic appliances are even more direct victfms of the squeeze. And by now quite a number of other industries are waiting anxiously to see how long it will be before cutbacks in production already an. nounced work through to them In some instances, Government policy is contributing to accelerating the downward movement. The building industry must be wondering with some foreboding how much longer the authorities will go on trying to hold down mortgage rates. The longer these are frozen, the greater the mortgage famine will be anc the sharper the turndown in new house building. Meantime the price freeze is bringing company liquidity under increasing pies sure and thus lessening both the incentive and the ability tc invest. Ministers meantime are stick ing to their forecast that un employment s - unlikely tc exceed 2p cnt at the bottorf of the cycle. ,Thi stimate however, is beginn ig to look less and Ids realistic day by day A great deal will depend on the scope which does in fact exist for a rapid .and smooth re. deployment of displace labour By and large, the untoit have recognised, however unwillingly, that in the present situation they cannot and should not insist on work sharing. This does not exclude the possibility of un, official strike action against redundancies here and there. Labour Requirehent,. How fast unemployment' will rise hinges on the extent to which management will revise its estimates of long-term labour requirements. Highly skilled men apart-they were and remain in short supply every. where-many companies must by now be wondering whether they can continue to carry an inflated work force through a prolonged period of stagnation. As long as demand remained high, the inducement to hang on to workers was considerable in view of the continuing shortage of manpower forecast in the National Plan. For the time being, though, it is hard to see how the Govern- ment can hope to start reflating the economy until the balance of payments is back in surplus. The official estimate is that the second quarter of next year will see Britain back in the black. But the actual figures for that quarter will not become avail- able until next September. Against the background of a tight cash position and at best static output, the shakeout of labour could on this occasion be very much greater than in past stop phases. There is general agreempnt that the real unemploymept peak will not come until the winter of 1967-68. If unemployment con. tinues to rise at the rate it moved up in August, the 2.0 per cent. figure will be reached in Feb- ruary, 1967, and will go on rising to well beyond the Government forecast. The faster the increase, the more it will be apparent that redeployment is not taking place. In that case the chances thqt the next bout of expansion can be allowed to run on for any length of time without generating the type of inflationary pressures all too familiar in past short-lived booms are small. The coming few months will test to the full the proposition on which, in public at any rate, the Govern. ment based its July mequres- that a rapid redeployment of labour and a resulting increase In the efficiency of the economy as a whole are in fact attainable within a comparatively short. time span and with existing polices."

   "text_content" : "BY emuSTOmPHER TUOENDIa T HIS S announce- ment that tO Concil Amoco group i made an- other commurcial discovery-its second in two attempts-is the first piece of encouraging news to come out of the North Sea since the spring. Too much should not be made of it. The successful well in block 49/27 is only five miles south-east of the find made last April on the Leman Bank in block 49/26 by ShellEsso. So it should be regarded as part of the same structure rather than as a separate field. But it will do much to restore the somewhat tarnished image of that accumu- lation. When the discovery was announced Shell-Esso hailed it as being of \"considerable impor tance,\" and unofficial estimates put the potential of the field at 1,000m. cubic feet a day. the equivalent of the U.K.'s current gas consumption. Then three wells drilled nearby came up withdisappointing results, and the optimism began to 'look somewhat premature. Now those first estimates again take on a realistic air. The main significance of the new find is political rather than geological. It strengthens the argument of those who say there is plenty of gas in the North Sea, and that the financial outlays involved in finding it are not enough to justify a high price. It therefore helps the Gas Council in its' negotiations with - the oil companies, 60r *1e trmn I. at which the dicoverti should be sold. â¢ At present the main discus sions are bedasn id with the Shell.Eso parttnrship, - an these will set the pattern .for all the other contracts. The two esides are. sill talking about tech. * nical matters, such as the date a when supplies should begin, the tpoint at. which they should t- Slanded, and the load factor of Sthe pipelines. Until these are Ssettled- it would bW fruitless to s f a.i ce. But price s, of Sco6ue, the' rmQt cncial matter, and the moment is fast apprach * ing when the negotiators will 8 have to start discussing it Final Terms Soon rhe final terms are expected to be ready for announcement t either at the end of October or some time in November, P although the final date will prob Sably depend mainly on the kGovernment. Ever since it became apparent some months ago that the North Sea search was one of the most e exciting elements on the eco- nomic scene, ministers have Smade it plain that they want the ' contracts finalised as quickly as possible. And they are in a Sposition to get what they want. T he Minister of Power. Mr. h Richard Marsh, has the statu- Story authority to act as referee and to impose a formula on the is two sidUes bould they fail to d are. To lhelp him work out bis deas he has the services of s. Mr. Michael Posner, a Cam. e brdp ..conomics don and id former New Statesman writer. )r as special adviser in addition to 0 the civi servants. b. The disadvantage of setting te theprice now is that nobody has 1 apy.'idea how much gas there is 6 under the North Sea. The area ,f has so far more than fulfilld the re highest hopes of the exploers, o but on the basis of the idforma- ,f ,tion available it is impbdiible to r, 46. more than hazard a guess at i, .the potentiality of the silds that il have already been discovered. It will be remarkable if the re- sults of the next twelve months drilling are as successful as those of the last year. and it may be ,o that the last commercial accu- it mulation has been found. >r For its part, the gas industry r, wants to be able to plan its b- future sales policy, and to decide ie what to do about pipeline build- ing and the existing coal and oil it plants for making town gas. h Until the area boards know how st much they will have to pay for o- the gas, they cannot say how re much they can absorb-. For the te present all the Gas Council can is do is to ask them for alternative a schemes based on possible price t. levels. r. Both sides approach the price .- problem in agreement on two e points: they, want the search to ie proceed as quickly as possible. and they want to 'ns that even tetativel ..mall aepsaroni tion o~f r.

Each side has strong argu. ments. The Gas Council, con vinced that the North Sea contains enormous reserves, points out that the rising level of oil imports and the high cost of coal imposes an increasing strain on the economy. The oil com* panies contend that as the exist. ing gas market is growing at WH~RETHE RIGS ARE :SMELI CONTINI-MOBIL more than 10 per cent. a year ad as only a small proportion of the country's homes have central heating, all the gas that s likely to be found will be .eeded there. They go on to say hat if prior commitments are made to industrial consumers, demand may be so stimulated in he short run that prices will ave to be raised in a few years' time to keep it within the limits of the available supply. Out of this basic difference grow two opposing philosophies on price. The Gas Council wants i to be on a cost-plus basis with a sliding scale to take account of he varying sizes of the accumu. lations. Thus on the first tranche of, say, 50m. cubic feet a day it would be willing to pay a fairly igh price, while on amountt in .xcess of 1,000m. cubic feet a ay it would expect to pay less than Id a therm. But whatever Bhe details, the gasmen want the verage price of gas at the beach :o be low enough for them to ompete with industrial fuel oil, which probably means not more han 3d a therm: Market Value The oil companies argue that acost plus formula of this kind would encourage the explorers o concentrate only on the most promising areas. They feel that he main criterion should be the price of other available fuels, in other words the market value of the gas. On this basis the ompanies will be encouraged o take risks by looking every- where in the hope of making a killing, and they will be able to use the big accumulations to arry the cost of the smaller nes. They therefore tend to avour a fixed price to apply cross the board whatever the az of the reserve, and the indi- cations are that they would be unhappy to see it set any lower than 4d a therm. There is no doubt that the oil companies deserve a generous rate of return on their finds. As yet only the most favourable regions of the North Sea have been penetrated by the drilling bit, and more dry wells will be completed. Quite apart from the fact that these will cost a lot of money, they will be taking up the time of valuable drilling .i equipment, which is in short supply all over the world and could possibly be more profit- ably employed elsewhere. Another factor that . must enter the equation is the effect which any settlement will have on the Governments of the main oil producing nations. However large the North Sea gas reserves, they will not compare in Import- ance with the country's oil inpo'-. If the U.K. Govern- ment provides the Middle East with the precedents it needs to secure a substantial'increase- in the cost of oil, the economy would suffer badly. Nevertheless a balance must be struck. As the protagonists of the gas industry point out, the higher the price on the beach the higher will be the price to the consumer. This will mean that the nationalised gas industry's statutory monopoly is being used to provide profits for private en. terprise. They are also quick to remark that the vast majority of concerns in the North Sea are foreign, mainly U.S. and to a lesser extent Canadian. Thus the higher their profits the more money will be remitted out of this country, or in the case of companies that rely on their parent organisations for most of their capital, the less money will be sent in.",

   "text_content" : "THE SAVER who can afford to wait for a sizeable part of the re- turn on an investment until re- demption day comes round can hardly do better at the moment, as I pointed out in last Saturday's article, than to make a journey into the gilt-edged bargain ,basement. But if it is a matter of great im- portance to him to collect the in- come as he goes along, a .much more attractive proposition may be a local authority loan operation. For thanks to the apprecable lift given to rates in this part of the Reld during the past month or two by the Government's decision to travel even further down the tighter money road, the saver can rarely before-if ever-have had it so good there as at present. Yields on marketable Govern- ment securitles have suffered materially at the hands of the re- cent recovery in the gilt-edged mar. ket. But returns equivalent to a good 8 per cent, can still be obtained in this sector by those who are far enough into the In come tax class to be able to bene- fit from the relatively favourable tax position-allowing for apiltpl gains tax liabilitles--o the capltpl appreciation part of the return. However, It Is the case that a size able part of these bil yields is in- variably represented by the capital gain that will accrue when redemp. tion day comes round. About the highest runnin lnterest yield obtainable on gilt-edged securities in the short-dated to medium-dated range at the moment is 6 per cent,-this is on the 64 per cent. Exchequer stock maturing In 1969. For most of the stocks carrying gross return equivalent to over 8 per cent., thi interest element accounts, it has ti be said. for no more than abou 4 per cent. By contrast, \"high yields--n waiting required.\" would make i most fitting slogan for loc authority borrowrs in search o savings. Investors with the Â£10,0CX plus needed to enable them t qualify for the privileged treatmen extended to the institutiona operator can reckon to obtain ai much as 7% or even 8 per cent on money they are prepared t( make available to local authoritle for periods of up to ten years--l they want to go longer than that they will probably have to accep slightly shaded down rates. The opportunities The smaller investor canno expect to get returns as generoui as these, his money being relativel) more expensive to service. Bu more and more local authorstie have been coming to the concluslor that they should go out of thel way to cater for him, and so hb will find a wide range of opportuni ties to invest in this field at ratei anging from 7 per cent. upwards Although local authorities ar- all in the same line of business, so to speak, these offers differ both as regards the rate of interesi quoted and the period for which he money will be acceptable, But the broad position is that sums of from Â£2,000 upwards are accepted at a rate of 71 per cent. for periods of from two to five though occasionally seven--years. If one cannot command Â£2,000 but can muster between Â£500 and Â£1,000, a rate of 7e per cent. is obtainable-again usually for periods of two to five years but sometimes longer. - For sums of less than Â£00, the rate of interest quoted by most local authorities is 7 per cent. Anything from Â£100 upwards will usually be taken at this figure for from two to five or two to seven years. It is rare for these bodies to be willing to accept less than 100 but occasionally a figure of Â£30 is mentioned as the starting point. This is the broad theme. But there are a number of interesting variations on it. A few local authorities-Bromsgrove RDC is a good e.ample-have undertaken to go as high as 7% per cent. for the weightier non-institutional packages-that is Â£2,000 upwards. Some, notably the County of \"arwick, have been offering to issue securities at & small discount -a refinement which has the effect of bringing the effective rate out Y per cent. or more beyond the coupon rate of, say, 7 per cent. Some, again, have been advertis ing their willingness to take money on a deposit loan basis-that under arrangements making it repayable on seven days' notice though some. times only after the expiration of a minimum starting period of three months or so. Chester City, for example, has been in the market at 6% per cent. on this basis for sums exceeding Â£1,000. Other authorities are seeking to BY C. GORDON TETHER whet the investor's appetite by openly pledging themselves-as in the case of the County of Essex- to arrange premature repayment in the event of the lender encounter- ing an emergency. There is a widespread belief that most local authorities will be found ready to release an investor's money in such circumstances, so that this may not be as special a facility as it sounds. But it no doubt adds to the peace of mind of the lender to have it put down in writing. If local authorities have to go on fighting as hard for their money as they are at the moment, the day will doubtless arrive when investors willing to chip in with a minimum of Â£1,000 or so will be offered the freedom of the borough, with free access to the pier, municipal swimming baths, chamber music concerts at the town hall and so forth. But even as things stand, their terms are well worth considering where current income is important. And I would have thought that such considera. tion should not pay any serious attention to alleged differences in the security such investment affords. The plain truth is that the danger of default on a local authority in- vestment Is not significantly greater than the danger of default on the Government's own paper and that a small local authority is no more likely to provide the investor with a shock than a large one. No Government could ever afford to allow the slightest doubt to be cast on the reliability on this form of paper for any number of reasons and the Treasury can be regarded, therefore, as standing fully behind every scrap of it that is issued.",

As soon as the names ot the edundant are known, the Labour Ministry hopes to send special teams to interview them on the pot. But whether they will becoime -deployed in undermanned vital idustries depends on whether the men accept any of the jobs offerel, In 4bhepasti mady 'workers have preferred to ride out a recession working on the buses, or as petrol attendants, barmen and in other temporary jobs returning to the higher-paid assembly lines when things picked up. This time the movement away fromthe car industry may be more permanent. Already the National Coal Board is beginning to pick up recruits, and the machine tool, :lectrical engineering and oth:r industries are looking for skilled men. However, union fears that there may not be enough jobs in the engineering field will be increased by figures just issued, which show that in the Midlands region vacancies in engineering have shrunk to 5,700 from 7,000 at the August count. There are only about .1,300 in other metal-using industries. One in five of 21,000 manual *orkers at BMC's Longbridge plant at Birmingham could lose their jobs because of production c-~t-acks,, Mr.,.Dick Ethgridce, works convenor. told a mass meet- in of 10,000 workers yesterday. The Transport and General Workers' Union has nut forward a \"week on, week off\" work sharing plan to avoid redundancies in the Lonabridge Group of Delivery Agents who deliver cars. However. Mr. Alan Law. secretary of the TGWU's Birmingham com- mercial trade group, has indicated that there is little chance of his members accepting the plan",

But although Harland ind Wolff had other interests, they vere not sufficient to osset the sub. antial losses on their main ctivity, shipbuilding. Early this summer. Mr. Faulkn-e revealed, the directors of Harland and Wolff had received financial and legal advice which confirmed that, unless the company received an early and substantial injection of working capital, they would have no alternative but to put the company into liquidation. The company's available re sources were fully committed, be added, and as no other immediate source of finance was available, th- directors had asked the N. Ireland Government, as a matter of urgency, if they would help. 12,000 Jobs Saved twelve thousand jobs would have been lost if the Belfast yard had been closed, said Mr. Faulkner. But the help given could \"only mean a complete reorgan- isation of the firm with new thinking and some hard and un- comfortable decisions in the Boardroom and in the yard itself.\" The guarantee loan of LÂ£1 i. will be provided by the Northern Bank and the Belfast Banking Company for a maximum period of nine months. Further, the Min- istry has power to appoint a sinan- clla controller and to satisfy itself that rapid and satisfactory arrange- ments for the reconstruction of the firm are being made."

   "text_content" : "Fini clal Times Reprter I THREE YEARS AGO, there was a flood of investment into bowling halls by the entertain ment industry. That investment is now grinding to a halt Ther are developers sitting on sites for which they can find-no takers, and several bowlin entres, which can cost Â£250,00 to build, hive recently closed down. What has gone wrong? There is no simple answer, but the idea that American experience would be easily re- peated was one false assumption, which led to a basic lack of alesmanship. There are 30m. bowlers in the United States, in the U.K. less than im. Increas- ingly these days British opera- tors are aware of the need for promotional activities, but it has taken them some time. In the meantime, about 130 bowling centres have been built, not all of them in suitable locations. For the siting is a complex operation in market research. This is particularly the case when a new building is involved, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t but the costs of conversion, usually of cinemas, can be con- siderable, too. A bowling lane, with woods surfaced to within a 40,000th of an inch and auto- matic pin-setting machinery, costs nearly Â£6,000, and the larger companies do not find it worthwhile to install less than 20 lanes. At peak times, too, it is difficult to earn more than fl per hour per lane. As a result, bowling centres must be well placed to attract a wide custom, which again adds to costs; a rule of thumb is now thought to be a population of 4,000 per lane available within three miles. Such a rule, how- ever, has numerous exceptions. Hull, for example, has seen closures probably because it is in a populous but low wage area where the costs of a game, up to 4s for ten minutes, are unacceptable. In Liverpool it was vandalism which forced the early closure of the Ambas- sador bowling centre. Yet in other, .much smaller places like Llanelly .or Walton-on-Naze proftability has been achieved. and not solely from holiday business. The presumption must be that smaller concerns, ably managed, can achieve success in the most unlikely places. The Luton-Bedford area with two bowling centres, might also be thought dangerously near saturation level, yet Arbiter and Weston is about to open a third and is expecting a return of not less than 25 per cent a year. It was discovered almost acci- dentally by installing a juke- box that allowing people to dance gained more bowlers. There will be a variety of mass entertainment on offer, includ- ing a discotheque and various mechanical games, and an area for housewives to leave child- ren during the day. The loca- tion of this centre near the motorway and the affluence of Its potential clientele are signi- ficant. but if it makes the money expected of it, it will clearly be an achievement of clolely- controlled and flexible promo tion. Able management is the key, and will determine which firms are to flourish in the future. At present, over half the bowling centres in the U.K. are owned by eight companies: Ranks have 24 and Excel. whose only interest is in bowling, 19; with rather fewer come Associated British Picture. Granada and Ambassador, while Magnet. Brunswick and Universal, with a handful each, bring up the rear. The rest of the trade is in the hands of much smaller concerns. When bowling arrive9 in 1960, it was the cinema comr panics who had the premises, and conversions quickly began. But few of them now have plans for further expansion and they are cautious about the present state of business. Associated British Picture reports a profit of Â£230,000 from its 13 bowling centres, but is not thinking of developing any more at present. Granada, too, has no plans for further expan- sion at the moment while Ranks this year has seen a fall of Â£300,000 in profits\" from bowling, dancing and bingo, down a third on last year's figures. Arbiter and Weston is not planning further develop- ments built around bowling once it has completed its Luton de- velopment. For the time being, bowling alleys have reached a national saturation point. In and around Birmingham there are now eight centres, and the closure of Fair- lanes in Coventry showed that even the Midland market is not bottomless. Elsewhere, there are still openings to tempt sensible developers - South Wales. Carlisle. Eastern Scot. land. for example. At the moment, few are succumbing. For now, as well as money, confidence is necessary. Bowling, it seems, does not come naturally to anyone except the very young. People tend to be shy of performng in public and, thouh the rules and techniques of bowling do not take long to learn, organisa- tion and encouragement are essential. Activity leaders, leagues and trophies are the result. Promotion men contact factories and school organisa- tions. The family evening is stressed, with ancillary activities for as wide a range of interests as possible. But as such de- velopments involve human beings, the operators have to be careful not to get out of touch. Some are now estranged from their league players in a complicated controversy about the terms on which these de- votees should organise their bowling. Increasingly, people in the bowling industry are aware of the need for good managament. There have been a number of boardroom changes. The future looks a little easier for the smaller operator who is pre- pared to work long and hard at the selling of bowling, but the likelihood is that competition, both where bowling is already established and in the \"virgin territories.\" will be considerably tougher all round ."

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF Despite a welcome swing from loss to profit, John rhompsonm' need to conserve funds'precludes an interim divi- dend (see Lex Page 1). The John Lewis Partnership has pro* duced some good half-year figures, and the position of Army and Navy Stores is prob- ably better than it seems. Automotive Products has had a good first half but there is a cloud over the rest of the year (see Lex); and Nairn and Williamson reports a loss for' the first half. Courtaulds is making an offer for Ballito. Army & Navy The half-year results from Army and Navy Stores appear disappoint- ing. Sales have only risen 1.6 per cent. against an average of just under 4 per cent. for department stores, and profits before tax are down from Â£177,000 to Â£148,000. However, sales were up a tenth in the first half of 1965 which makes any further progress quite impres- sive and, more to the point, profits for the year are expected to be unchanged. Since SET will cost the group Â£200,000 in a full year of which only just over half is recoverable by higher prices, this is rather surprising. The explanation is heavy capital expenditure on the provincial stores (half the business) in previ- ous years which has now come to Fruition. In balmier days this would have pushed profits up nicely, but with London feeling the pinch it will do no more than keep them marking time. With the 13} per cent. dividend covered exactly once the ability to do even. this is valuable. In the light of last month's funding opera- tion as well a dividend cut is no longer a foregone conclusion which makes the 9.4 per cent. yield at 14s 3d look too high. Nairn & Williamson The interim statement from Nairn and Williamson (Holdings) makes dismal reading with a pre- tax loss of Â£350,000. for the 25 weeks to June 26 last. Admittedly this comes after charging severance payments and exceptional losses from writing down stock values in Australian subsidiaries, but even ignoring these items there would he a loss of Â£98,000 compared with a profit of Â£181,000 for the corres- ponding period of 1965 with the carpets and building products divi- sions still dragging their feet. Better things are looked for from the second half of 1966 but it would perhaps be wise to expect the group to do no more than break even over the year as a whole, against the profit of Â£219,000 earned in 1965 and Â£1.033m. in 1964. And prospects of a dividend are none too bright- the payment was reduced fron 9 per cent. to 3 per cent. last time and there is no interim on account of the current year. Competition in floorcoverings has been accentuated by the \"squeeze\" bringing price-cutting; and troubles in Australia have arisen from the swing from tradi- tional linoleum products to vinyl- floorcoverings. a transition which has already taken place in the U.K. The shares-down Is 0%d to a new \"low\" of 8s Od yesterday- do not yet acknowledge recovery prospects. Wm. Finlay (Belfast) The interim statement from Wm. Finlay (Belfast) is very encourag- ing. This colour printer and manufacturer of collapsible cartons and boxes looks well on the way to establishing new records in the current year. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 are up by almost a quarter to Â£55.000. and this from an increase of less than 5Y per cent. to Â£569,000 in sales. Thus margins have improved to 9.6 per cent. compared with 8.2 per cent. for the corresponding period of 1965 and 8.6 per cent. for the whole of last year. The trend of better margins stems from the benefit of past expenditure on new plant and machinery and there may be still more to come. On the other hand, although most of the group's busi- ness is now situated in Northern Ireland. and the tobacco industry -which seems unlikely to be much affected by economic factors-is a major customer, growth in the British market could be held in check. So. while it might be a little too optimistic to hope that Finlay can maintain its profits improvement through the second six months, a cheerful view is merited and the yield of 6.8 per cent. looks reasonable. Cover for the 20 per cent. dividend rate- the interim is currently maintained at 7%V per cent.-was nearly 1% times on last year's profits",

The current year has not been a happy one for Crompton. beset by severe iihredss in', costs and by flooding at the .Derby cable works; half time profits were down 23 per cent. Thus the tmarket is not very optimistic about the year's result and although the 10.4 per cent. dividend was last covered 1.7 times the rate now looks uncertain Although the dividends of Ransome and Marie Bearing and Walmsley (Bury) Group are expected to be held when the vear's fihures are announced on Wednesday and Friday respectively, profits arc expected to he down. A combination of labour troubles and bad weather had knocked Ransom's pretax profits down from Â£341.000 to Â£246,000 at half time. but orders had increased and factories (apart from Newark) were running to capacity. Wimcley forecast lower profits in the inlrlm report, when the dividend was in. creased to 6 per cent. for tax reasons: a A5 per cent, final is looked for. The same 30 per cent. final, mak. ing an unchanged 45 per cent. total. is expected from Neepsend Steel and Tool on Ttiesdnv, Directors were confident of another satisfactory year when they announced increased profits at the half year. but the market is taking a cautious view, There will be much disappointment If Judge Intermalnal does not keep to its forecast of at least 12 per cent. on Wednesday.

Interim should be repeated on Tuesday. United Biscuits and United Newspapers, both Wednesday, are expected to announce profits slightly up. A 171 per cent. Interim Is awaited from the former, while the latter will probably announce a 3 per cent. to make, with the 2 per cent. already paid, an unchanged 3 per cent. Two contrasting views of the huilding sector may be seen in United Builders Merehants on Wednesday and Georse Wlmpey on Thursday. United Builders has already warned of a possible dividend cut and the most te msarket hopes for is a soe n I terlm with a forecast of a reduced total payment.

In the crcumstances, the board hs decided it is in the best interests of shareholders to conserve resources and to omit an interim dividend.

Much depends on the Christmas trade, but Government policies will probably have an adverse effect and there are SET and higher finance charges to be faced, the directors point out. Profit for the half-year is stated after depreciation Â£57.000 (Â£56,000), and interest Â£61,000 (Â£50,000). Tax takes Â£31,000 (Â£63.000). leaving the net profit at Â£117,000 (Â£114,000).

Yesterday. the smouldering remains were still being damped down by 60 firemen. Mr. Cecil Bamberger, chairman, said the damage was covered by insurance and that the effects would not be too disastrous as the company had- storage space elsewhere. It would mainly be using its 40-acre yard at Roch- tord and space in the Port of London area. He anticipated \"very few delays in the normal functioning of the business\" as there were eight other yards. Among the timber lost was 1,000 tons of teak, claimed as the largest stock in the country. Two mystery 'phone calls to the fire brigade at about 9.40 on Thursday night were yesterday being investigated. They notified fires at \" Bambergers.

About one-quarter of the increase came from additional trading facili. ties in both retail and manufac- turing.. . Department store sales-some1.':9 per cent. of the total-increased by 7.8 per cent. to Â£25.5m., sales in Waltrose supermarkets and food shops by 25.7 per cent; to Â£5.3m., and whole- sale and manufacturing by 57.7 per cent. to Â£1,3m., mainly through the inclusion of sales of Stead McAlpin. The statement points out that department stores as a whole report an increase of 3 per cent., while the Partnership's increase, on the same basis, is 8 per cent. The increase reported for the food trade was II per cent, compared with the Partner- ship's 26 per cent. Oross profit increased approxi. mately in proportion to the sales rise, being higher by Â£1m. at Â£9.2m. Net tradin expenses increased by Â£823,000 and as a percentage of turn. over were a little higher-23.07 per cent. (22.94), while the resulting trad. Ing profit was 11.3 per cent. greater at Â£18m.

There are already signs that the credit squeeze is beginning to bite and with additional tax and the prices and incomes standstill will affect adversely sales and, both directly and indirectly, profit. \"We should be prepared for a period of difficult trading conditions for perhaps 18 months and possibly loner. The Partnership's financial position is. however, strong and its trading is highly competitive so that we can face this prospect with con. fidence,\" the statement adds. The 196566 review said it would he difficult to maintain trading profits in the current year as a whole and that, even if they were, the amount available for profit sharing and re. serves was bound to be lower because combined cost of company tax and dividends would be much higher.

Thrt uarplus available for profit sharing and reserves Is down by Â£92,000 due to the sharp in. crease In the cost of preference dividends and taxation on the profit required to pay them following the changes introduced by the Finance Act 1965.

Turnover for the first six weeks of the current half year is up by 6,2 per cent., but prospects are uncertain, The credit squeeze and the large sums payable to the Government from this month onwards of S.ET. and income tax on dividends and interest must have a dampening effect on turnover and directly and Indirectly on profit, The Partnershif's finanlal oiltion is however strong and it trading is hiIhly competi tive so that the prospect of d ult trading conditions can be face with confidence, John 1Lewis Properties Limited 1966 1965 329 133 19 22 M W\" 29 29 - (12) 48 39 211 114 John Lewis and Company Limited and its subsidiaries 1966 1965 32,104 28.693 1,471 1,327 96 67 80 80 64 64 - (59) 240 7S2 1,231 1,175 Suburban & Provincial Stores Limited and its subsidiaries 1966 1965 13,779 12,701 419 469 44 26 7 7 60 60 - (28) 2111 65 301 404 Â·-- Â· --- I~ - - I m II '' ~--- -",

However, maximum safety is ensured by the heavy blue. chip content of the portfolio. Hambros Link It was learnt last May that Hambros Bank was interested in unit trusts and its intentions were made plain this week by the plan to cooperate with Abbey Life in a jointly-owned manape. ment company. From Abbey's point of view this will secure Hamros' investment services and ensure a flow mos r ..... t lbr Hamhbros without avin t t. rttn continurlly to block and tp qfer.

This reflects the fall in the market since the trust was last displayed in June. when the offer price was Ss 2d and yield Â£7 10s per cent. A lot depends on how the individual views North Sea prospects, but the fund is clearly a success with a total value of Â£2.5m. The liquidity ratio of 5.8 per cent. emphasises the need for more funds, but average dividend cover of 1.4 times is reasonable for a trust with more than an element of risk. Castle Unit Masagement is also keeping up the pressure with another tap offer of Extra Income units on the same terms as before-4s lid (or the dealing price, if lower) to yield Â£9i per cent. Discount Offer Something which might become more widespread is the special dis- count offer recently made by Jesse Securites in all but one of its trusts.

To secure the immediate advantage of exceptionally high yield by buying when prices are low with wide scope for capital growth when stock markets return to better levels. 2. To have an investment, in a sector of British industry, on which all other industry depends, and which can look forward to continuing expansion, particularly in relation to the oil and gas development In the North Sea. This should be regarded primarily as a long-term Investment. Share prices (which In turn affect the price of the Units themselves) can go down as well as up, but without these fluctuations there would be no opportunity for advantageous share buying by the Managers or for capital appreciation.

   "text_content" : "by UA1~4 WIUAIN IN SPITE of the presence of th- good Irish handicapper, Red Slipper, the courageous filly, Pugnacity, and the more than use- ful Tesco Boy, the Queen Elizabeth il Stakes (3.55). run over one mile at Ascot this afternoon, is likely to devolve into a repetition of the Rous Memorial Stakes run over this distance at the Royal meeting in June. On that occasion, it will be remembered, Silly Season, who started at odds of 15 to 8 on, and who. after looking all oves the winner, was caught and beaten in the last strides by the American- bred Hill Rise. who will be ridden by Piggott this afternoon. At th- time the consensus of opinion was that G. Lewis. the rider of Silly Season, had been caught napping and that his mount ought to have won. But Silly Season is a difficult horse to ride, for he has to be covered up and produced at the precise psychological moment well inside the final furlong in order to produce a short, devastating burst of speed. And in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. where he hit the front sooner than he had done at Ascot, his run tapered off in the last 25 yards and he was caught almost on the post by Paveh. I do not envy Lewis his task this afternoon, and in any case, bearing in mind that Hill Rise had been in this country for less than three weeks before the Ascot race and was by no means fully wound up on that occasion, he is probably the safer selection. He was a top-class performer in the U.S. before join. ing N. Murless's Newmarket stable, and though his preparation is no doubt beig timed for the Prix de 1'Arc de Triomphe to be run at Longchamp on October 9. 1 under. stand that he is fit enough to do himself justice here. Earlier in the afternoon Polyfoto can be expected to win the Star and Garter Stakes (2.0). for he meets the three-year-old Queen of lihe Troops on 3 lbs better terms than in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York on 10 Ibs better terms than in the July Cup at Newmarket, on both of which occasions he finished well ahead of D. Thom's colt. Fab. who was backed down to favouritism for the Imperial Stakes at Kempton last Saturday and who ran disappointingly, has less to do in the Blue Seal Stakes (2.40). and only in her absence would I advocate support for Dundry Hill. a nice filly by High Perch, whom A. Budgett trains for Sir Foster Robinson. First Date may provide the champion jockey with yet an- other winner by taking the Golden Gates Nursery Handicap (4.25) though there is little to choose be- tween her and Floosie, judged on their running behind Pia in the Lowther Stakes at York. Bunker was my selection when he won a handicap for three-year- olds over Il miles here in July, and with bottom weight of 7 st 1 lb. reduced still further to 6 st. 10 lbs by E. Johnson claim- ing the 5 Ibs allowance, he will make them all go in the Red Deer Stakes (3.20) and Finish Fast. who showed signs of returning to his good form of last year when finishing fourh .behind Tarqogan. Aberdeen and Mayvllle in the Piccadilly Northern Cup at Ripon last month, has reasonable pros. pects in the Swinley Forest Handi. cap (4.55). W. Hern has sent Verdun and Walnut to Catterick where they ought to be capable of winning the Middleham Stakes (2.30) and the Askrigg Stakes (3.30) respectively.",

   "text_content" : "Wise inlveStors buy when markets fall Most investors buy shares when the market is already high. BUT it is a wise investor that takes advantage of the\"bargains\" when sharesdrop. Now Is the Time for Expert Investment Management Hambro Bank Limited, tle leading Merchant Bankers, are the investment adviser to Abbey Bonds, giving you the benefit of day-to-day analysis of Market conditions ... a special service normally available only to privileged large-scale investors. Collectively Abbey Bondholders qualify for this expert attention. It is in times of economic uncertainty such as the present that investment management expertise proves its value for the private investor. Abbey Bonds provide the simplest way to acquire the peace of mind that comes from a professionally- managed diversified portfolio. Share indices are about 16% lower than they were 4 months ago. By comparison, the performance of Abbey Bonds has been 10 points better than the indices. This reflects the value of investment know- how that cah make your money grow inthe future. How your money will be invested Timing of investment is always important-essential in current market conditions. The skill and experience built up by Hambros Bank gives them the aivantage of selecting which shares to buy-and when to buy them. The Fund is being invested in shares of leading companies such as those listed below, as well as a number of special situations: Lesney Products John Myers Penguin Publishing Phoenix Assurance Prudential Assurance Redman Tool Royal Insurance Rolls Royce Shell Steel Group Unilever Vokes Group Bowater Paper British American Tobacco Capper-Neill Chubb City of London R. Prop. Clay Cross Consolidated Gold Fields Crane Fruehauf Financial News Foseco Granada Great Universal Stores Do you? \"To a t sTM 1, I O=V KIce nBe gaeanptai Meeaacc The return you may expect on Abbey Bonds I The return depends upon future prices and yields from the Ordinary Shares in which your money will' be invested by Hambros' expert investment managers. The growth chart shows how your money would grow in value, assuming the shares yield 3% per annum net and share prices increase at an average rate of (a) 3% per annum or (b) 5% per annum. In the case of a person paying tax at the standard rate, the growth on the 5% basis would beequlvalenttoa before-tax yield of 11% per annum... and equiv- alent to a considerably higher before-tax yield in the case of a surtax payer. It is important to realise that Ordinary Share prices could rise faster or more slowly than this,-or they could fall. However, Abbey Bonds should be re- garded as a long-term investment and Share values over the past 50 years have shown a strong upward trend despite shorterterm fluctuations. Plus Guaranteed Life Assurance Cover For as long as you hold Abbey Bonds, your life is covered by Abbey Life Assurance Company Limited. For an amount which, in the lower age groups, is several times the amount of your investment. In the event of your death, your beneficiary or estate will receive the following amounts, or the current value of your Abbey Bonds, whichever is the greater. Age when buying Abbey Bonds Under 30 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-80 Life cover Tax per Â£100 Relief invested Â£400 4.6% Â£350 4.0% Â£300 3.5% Â£250 2.9% Â£200 2.3% Â£175 2.0% Â£150 1.7% Â£125 1.4% Â£100 1.2% No medical evidence will be required in normal cases but the Life Cover comes into force only upon acceptance by the Company. Valuable tax advantages- No Surtax Because Abbey Bonds are single-premium life policies, the net income from the shares is re- invested for the benefit of your Bonds, free of surtax. No Capital Gains Tax complications No Capital Gains Tax is payable by you on the proceeds of Abbey Bonds, and you do not have to worry about keeping records and making returns for Capital Gains Tax. Abbey Life reserves the right to reduce the amount payable to you to allow for its own prospective liability for Capital Gains Tax, but guarantees to restrict the deduction to two-thirds of the normal rate of Capital Gains Tax. (This has been taken into account in the growth illustrated above.) Income Tax relief You can also claim Income Tax relief on the money you put into Abbey Bonds. The amount of this tax relief varies with your age. If you pay Income Tax at the standard rate, you can claim tax relief as shown in the Table on the left, on the money you put into Abbey Bonds, provided your total life premiums (including, in respect to your Abbey Bonds, 7% of the guaranteed life cover), do not exceed i-th of your income. Estate Duty advantage If you wish, your Bonds can be written under the Married Women's Property Act for the benefit of your wife, husband or children, or as a Trust for the benefit of grandchildren or other beneficiaries. The effect of this is that the proceeds of the Bonds would, on your death, form a separate estate which, on present law, is not added to your other assets for death duty purposes. If you want to make this arrangement, tick the box in the application form. Limit You can put any amount from Â£100 to Â£5,000 into Abbey Bonds. Ease of Withdrawal You can surrender your Abbey Bonds for cash at any time for their full current value (the current value will be published each week in The Financial Times, The Times,The Sunday Timesand other national papers). Management Charges As with Unit Trust investment, a deduction of 5% of the amount subscribed and *f% per half year of the investment funds is made to cover expenses. HOWEVER . .. in the case of Abbey Bonds, this covers the life assurance cost as well. And the benefit of the tax relief you can claim further reduces this initial charge, a benefit which you could not obtain on a corresponding Unit Trust investment.
