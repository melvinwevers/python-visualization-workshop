SATURDAY Afternoon. Nothing of outstanding importance took place in Money market circles during this morning's short session. Lombard Street and the foreign exchange market carried on, but busi- ness was naturally of modest dimen- sions. In the foreign exchanges the American dollar actually moved slightly in favour of London, but dealings in this and certain Conti- nental currencies were adversely affected by the difficulty of communi- cation with the Continent-even by telegram. Short loan conditions were tolerably comfortable although one or two houses were looking for money at one time. The position was helped by the infiltra- tion of moneys disbursed 1y the Govern- ment on Friday, but the large-scale evacuation still entailed a considerable demand for notes. Fresh accommodation over the week-end, however, was available at 3 per cent. against bills and at 3% per cent. against bonds. There was no clearing bank buying of bills, but the market had the alternative outlet of the special buyer, rates quoted being 3%, per cent. for September's, 3% per cent. for October's, and 3\"/, per cent. for November maturities. As re- corded in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Satur- day, the leading houses raised their rates for 1940 maturities to 5 per cent. Three months bank drafts (the December maturity) were still quoted 3\"/6 per cent. LJAs DUISCOULN' PER CENT. PER CENT.

DOLLAR CHEAPER French Franc Again Under Control Conditions in the foreign exchanges were again rather nominal, although busi- ness was transacted in certain of the leading currencies. American dollars met with a certain amount of liquidation and, after touching $4.25, closed a cent in favour of sterling at$4.20. Canadian dollars were 8 cents cheaper on balance at $4.36%, but the Argentine peso improved to 18.40. Among Continental currencies, French francs were held by the control at 175%, the closing quotation being 175%. Belgian belgas appreciated to 22%, while Swiss francs hardened to 18.22%. Swedish kroner, Danish kroner and .Norwegian kroner were all nominally firmer. No forward quotations were available.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 3rd Sept. Stocks rose sharply from the open- ing on Saturday, and the tape was soon three minutes late, the first-hour turn- over reaching 1,020,000 -sharea.-Profit- taking started early in the second hour, and the close was irregular. Net gains generally reached 2 points, with larger advances in some specialities. Steels, Metals, especially Coppers, Aircrafts and Packings were the strongest groups. Rails were only slightly higher, while Utilities further eased. The Dow-Jones closing average for Industrials gained 2.84 at 138.09 and Rails 0.25 at 26.18, but Utilities lost 0.18 at All United States and Canadian markets will be closed to-day for Labour Day. 23.41. Turnover for the two-hour session reached 1,790,000 shares, covering 736 stocks, of which 497 advanced, 132 de- clined and 107 were unchanged. Among commodities, domestic copper rose Yc to 11c per pound and zinc 1c to 5c per pound. Rubber futures more than lost an early sharp advance, closing 60 to 30 points per pound lower. Hides followed the same course, ending 55 to 43 points per pound down. In the Bond market Treasury and high- grade domestic issues declined. U.S. Government bonds are a nominal market; the Federal Reserve is the main buyer, and sellers are being asked questions as to who the sales are for, etc. Foreign bonds lost a point to 6 points, the latter in French 1949 Sevens. Sterling opened 46 dowbii ('$ l, ralied to $4.22%, dropped to $4.20%, but re- covered to close at $4.22, a net decline of 3c. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has reduced its rediscount rate from 1% to 1 per cent. Steel mills at Pittsburg are scheduled to start next Tuesday at 60 per cent. of capacity, a rise of 3 points to a new high for the current recovery. Youngstown mills will operate at 57 per cent.

The Rubber Position Like everything else, the position of rubber producers and their shares is at present subordinated to the political situation, but the August rubber figures have a certain significance. During the past month United King- dom stocks declined by no less than 12,685 tons to 45,621 tons. The latter figure is considerably less than half the total of a year ago, although it is thought that some of the recent deliveries may return into stock as a result of the action of the Government in preventing some loaded steamers from leaving port.

As announced on Page Two, a scheme has been put into operation by the Board of Trade under the War Risks Insurance Act under which the Board undertake, in relation to per- sons carrying on business in the United Kingdom as sellers of goods, the liability of insuring such persons against King's enemy risks in respect of goods insurable under Part II of the Act. The measure is compulsory on goods over Â£1,000. To-day the Board of Trade will com- mence to carry on the business of in- suring cargoes against war risks. Licenses are now required to acquire iron and steel goods and cer- tain raw materials, but provision is made for exemption, by notice, from the necessity to obtain a license in favour of certain classes of pur- chasers and /or certain purposes. (Details Page Three Col. Four.) ESSENTIAL GOODS PRICE REGULATION AND FAIR DISTRIBUTION An Order made by the Minister of Supply provides for the control of the following essential materials:- Iron and steel, non-ferrous metals (copper, lead and zinc), aluminium, wool, flax, hemp, jute, silk, rayon, timber, paper, leather, molasses and industrial alcohol. Trades and industries concerned are to :.be g~wptlyiojified of .the scope, of this. control and of the procedure they should adopt. The control aims at regulation of prices and equitable distribution of supplies, with preference to Government and essen- tial civil requirements. The following controllers have been appointed: - SIR ANDREW DUNCAN (iron and steel). CAPTAIN O. LYTTELTON (non-ferrous metals). HoN. G. CUNLIFFE (aluminium). SIR HARRY B. SHACKLETON (wool). SIR HARRY LINDSAY (flax). MR. A. M. LANDAUER (hemp). MR. G. MALCOLM (jute). MR. E. W. GOODALE (silk and rayon). DR. E. C. SNOW (leather). MAJOR A. I. HARRIS (timber). MR. A. RALPH REED (paper). MR. N. GARROD THOMAS (sulphuric acid). MR. F. C. O. SPEYER (sulphate of ammonia). MR. HOWARD CUNNINGHAM (other ser- tilisers). MR. A. V. BOARD (alcohol, molasses and solvents). CONTROL OF EXPORTS EXTENSION OF LICENSE SYSTEM The Board of Trade order prohibiting the export from the United Kingdom applies in some cases to all destinations and in others to specified destinations, except under license, of a large number of commodities, including ships' stores. These prohibitions do not apply to the export of goods to the Channel Islands, nor to the export to Eire of goods other than certain specified commodities, includ- ing wheatmeal and flour; tinned and canned meat; meat extracts and essences; refined sugar, raw silk, waste and nolls and silk yarns. Applications for licenses to export any of the commodities other than coal, coke and manufactured fuel, should be addressed to the Export Licensing Depart- i ment, Board of Trade. 80-82. Pall Mall. and manufactured fuel, should be addressed to the Export Licensing Depart- ment, Board of Trade, 80-82, Pall Mall. S.W.1. LUXURY IMPORTS BAN Under a Board of Trade Order imports of certain goods are prohibited except under license. Imports of luxuries and goods, of which there are sufficient home supplies, are to be limited so as to con- serve exchange for purchases of war products. Goods covered by the Order include pottery and glass, cutlery, clocks and watches, textile goods, footwear, certain chemicals and paints, soap, typewriters, motor-cars, toilet requisites and luxury foodstuffs. FUEL CONSERVATION COAL, GAS, ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION QUOTAS Supplies of coal, gas and electricity are to be conserved. Defence Orders from the Min-e Department state that the fuel and lighting Order, which comes into force on Thursday, is to conserve supplies and pro- vide against shortages due to local dis- locations. The quarterly consumption of coal, gas and electricity by domestic consumers and small industrial consumers will be limited to 75 per cent. of the quantity consumed in the corresponding quarter of the year ended 30th June, 1939. Consumers of over two tons of coal in the year ended 30th June, 1939, must register with a licensed coal merchant whom they are free to choose. No consumer of coal will be rationed below two tons per annum, and small con- sumers of less than two tons per annum will not be required to register, but must obtain from the local fuel overseers a cer- tificate which they must produce when they purchase coal. - \" .. Gas and electricity consumers will not be rationed below 100 therms of gas and 200 units of electricity in a year, and con- sumers who, in the year ended 30th June, 1939, consumed less than those quantities will be entitled to consume up to those limits. COAL PRICES The Export and Bunkers Order provides that no coal may now be sold for export except at a permitted price. The Wholesale Prices (Inland) Order, now operative, states that the distributor's margin on wholesale sales of coal is not to exceed that made during the previous year. Announcing the Retail Coal Prices Order, the Department states that during the emergency no increase in the general levels of coal prices charged by producing districts for inland or export supply will be permitted except after agreement between the Central Council and the Mines Department. COLD STORAGE PLANTS LICENSING AS FROM 16th SEPTEMBER A further Defence Order brings cold storage plants under Government control. The Order applies to commercial plants with capacity of 2,000 cubic ft and over. These plants, as from 16th September, are to be operated under license, both as to reception and delivery of goods. Proprietors affected should apply imme- diately for licenses to the Director of Cold Storage, Food (Defence) Department, Great Westminster House, Horseferry- road, S.W.1. WOOL SUPERVISION Under the Ministry of Supply a Wool Control has been set up, with Sir Harry Shackleton as the Controller. - C~IIIl~U i)VLII JUI1B) IYJYÂ· Consumers of over two tons of coal in the year ended 30th June, 1939, must register with a licensed coal merchant whom they are free to choose.

   "text_content" : "The suspense is over: the die cast: the responsibility firmly fixed. The nation, and the Stock Exchanges, know where they stand. The dwindling of Stock Exchange business, deplored for months, has proved a blessing in dis- guise; it has reduced to a minimum the open account in stocks and shares. Never in their history have nation and Stock Exchange stood so well pre- pared for war. The final issue admits of no doubt in any country save one- and even in that one country there must be grave misgivings in the minds of a business community whose sanity is treated with the same contempt as Herr Hitler has shown for humanity and the decencies of dealing. July, 1914 The \"mean\" prices that played so important a part in Stock Exchange markets 25 years ago were those of the Carry-over on 27th July, 1914. These were in respect of the 19-days Settlement that finished on Wednes- day, 29th July, when, and on the fol- lowing day, the Stock Exchange was open. The Committee held an emergency meeting early on the morning of Friday, 31st July. A letter was read from the then Lord Rothschild urgently supporting a previously- advanced proposal to close the Stock Exchange. The doors of the House were closed at a few minutes past ten o'clock a.m. The only sight of the Stock Exchange interior which mem- bers obtained until 4th January, 1915, was that vouchsafed to those who re- ceived permission for access to the Strong Room. Commodity Shares The calmness of attitude displayed by all the Stock Exchange markets as they faced last week's crisis can be accepted as a guarantee that there is .little if any likelihood of any rush on the public's part to sell wildly or indiscriminately. In the autumn of 1915 there was so unbalanced a feeling that, to take one market as an instance, Rubber shares, were flung away for anything they would fetch. Florin shares in quite reputable companies changed hands in thousands at twopence and three- pence each-sometimes at less. To-day there is not much chance of a similar slaughter. More probably the investor will be on the look-out for cheap shares in any of the commodity producers, in whatever market. Not even the first shock of war's out- break need be expected to shake the financial nerves of holders of shares in sound companies that deal in com- modities. Shipping Shares The shipping industry is one that may be expected to expand in activity and profitable working under war con- ditions. During the previous war, the companies did exceedingly well. Prices of their stocks and shares went booming, only to collapse during the later years of depression. The suspense is over the dihas be cast: the responsibility firmly fixed. The nation, and the Stock Exchanges, know where they stand. The dwindling of Stock Exchange business, deplored for monthscipal shares proved a blessing in dis- guise;not has reduced to a minimum the open account in stocks and shares. Never in their history have nation and Stock Exchange stood so well pre- pared for war. The final issue admits of no doubt in any country save one- and even in that one country there must be grave misgivings in the minds of a business community whose sanity is treated with the same contempt as Herr Hitler has shown for humanity and the decencies of dealing. July, 1914 The \" mean \" prices that played so important a part in Stock Exchange markets 25 years ago were those of the Carry-over on 27th July, 1914. These were in respect of the in-days Settlement that finished on Wednes- day, 29th July, when, and on the fol- lowing day, the Stock Exchange was open. The Committee held an emergency meeting early on the morning of Friday, 31st July. A letter was read from e t then Lord Rothschild urgently supporting a previously- advanced proposal to close the Stock Exchange. The doors of the House were closed at a few minutes past te on- o'clock a.m. The only sight of the Stock Exchange interior which mem- bers obtained until 4th January, 1915, was that vouchsafed to those who re- ceived permission for access to the latest Strong Room. Commodity Shares The calmness of attitude displayed by all the Stock Exchange markets as they faced last week's crisis can be accepted as a guarantee that there is litears, but camy likelihood abony rush on the public's part to sell wildly or indiscriminately. In the autumn of 1915 there was so unbalanced a feeling that, to take one market as an instance, Rubber shares, were flung away for anything they would fetch. Florin shares in quite reputable companies changed hands in thousands at twopence and three- pence each-sometimes at less. To-day there is not much chance of a similar slaughter. More probably the investor will be on the look-out for cheap shares in any of the commodity producers, in whatever market. Not even the first shock of war's out- break need be expected to shake the financial nerves of holders of shares in sound companies that deal in com- modities. Shipping Shares The shipping industry is one that may be expected to expand in activity and profitable working under war con- ditions. During the previous war, the companies did exceedingly well. Prices of their stocks and shares went booming, only to collapse during the later years of depression. Recently, inquiry has been renewed, although it is recognised that the previous profits are by no means likely to be secured. At to-day's prices, and taking the last-paid divi- dends as the basis of calculation, the principal shares show reasonable but not excessive yields.

   "text_content" : "To establish the right to live decently in peace is the sole object , of the war to which this country set 's hand yesterday. That such an end should demand this hateful recourse to arms is the most complete indict- ment of the man who has caused it. Herr Hitler, with his Nazi version of a doctrine as old as sin-namely, to glorify force and reject every stan- dard but its own-has willed this conflict on the world. As the embodi- ment of that doctrine, flatly oppos- ing the peace and liberty which civilisation demands, he and his regime must now meet the fate of all who choose the sword to achieve evil. They will perish by the sword, and with their passing a better world, and with it a better Germany, will be born. The criminal courses upon which Herr Hitler has launched his countrymen are beyond question. The naked untruth of his reason for attacking Poland - namely, that terms had been offered it and been rejected-shows him to be out of touch with reality. Such conduct calls for control even more clearly in public than in private life, and Great Britain is now in the van- guard of those who are determined to end it. We are resolute, united and prepared as never before. In direct contrast to Nazi Germany, whose arms are backed by an economy already sapped and strained by a regime which has antagonised almost every neutral Power, our resources were never better organised and our goodwill never higher. With such advantages and with such a cause to inspire it, this nation goes to war for peace and the constructive advance of humanity which only peace can secure.",

   "text_content" : "The resources of the Exchange Fund can now be used for war pur- poses by the Treasury, and its limit of Â£550,000,000 has been removed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's state- ment that it can be devoted to buying gold or securities must mean that the Fund's present holdings of like character would all be available for the purposes of national defence. Although the current extent of the Fund's resources is undisclosed we have the comforting knowledge that they will constitute an exceedingly valuable bulwark. In operation, no doubt, they would be linked up with a mobilisation of securities, for which the way was opened by the Treasury Order, reproduced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES last Monday, enforcing control of a number of classes of securities payable, or with a right of payment, in certain foreign currencies. The question of maintaining the flow of supplies from overseas would assume in war an importance even transcending that which it has in peace for a nation which must import much of its food, as well as basic raw materials for its industries. To replenish emergency stocks we must have at our disposal all the foreign currency we can obtain-steps have been taken for the control of foreign exchange-or the gold which can be exchanged at will for foreign cur- rency. An enlarged Exchange Fund will provide an excellent vehicle for that and other purposes. The Fund is an instrument which, originating in 1914, when a similar need arose, has been developed on specialised lines during the present decade and will now have to be broadened again. The accompanying provisions of the same Act, on the other hand, exemplify, as so many other recent developments have done, the manner in which the authorities concerned have assimi- lated and improved upon the lessons of those earlier war years. Arrange- ments are already being put into force for ensuring a sufficiency of currency and for enabling the bill market to continue its functions. It is anticipated that currency will be in sufflienit supply, as envisaged by the A4t, but the possible advances to the banks (to enable them to obtain more notes) and to bill acceptors are on a different plane. -If the experience of 1914 is repeated, any such assist- ance obtained by the banks will be limited in amount and quickly repaid. The changed conditions ruling make it likely that the discount market will require less support than in 1914, but however that may be the arrangements now made should work very smoothly, while the use of Government funds, instead of direct loans by the Bank of England, will modify the inflationary effects which otherwise would ensue."

   "text_content" : "Apart from dealings in wheat, cotton and sugar, business in com- modities came to a standstill last Friday. The result is that prices have for the most part been frozen at Thursday's closing level. During the past week the commodity markets had to adjust themselves to radi- cal changes in the commercial life of the country. The emergency regulations imposing a licensing system for exports drastically nar- rowed the limits of free deal- ings and many markets became largely nominal. The influences affect- ing such changes in prices as were made were partly of a sentimental nature, reflecting reactions to day-to- day news on the course of the crisis. On the positive side, however, was the automatic adjustment of quota- tions to the changes in the sterling- dollar rate, prices moving in inverse sense to the exchange. Practically all commodities were affected in this way. There was, finally, the rise in war risk rates, the cost of which has been added to the price of base metal and other commodities. Apart from the knowledge that the situation is well under control, the week's changes in prices conveyed very little about the underlying trend of markets. Owing to the operation of the control committee, the spot price of tin has been pegged at Â£230 per ton and the last sales from the Buffer Pool were made at that level. There is a shortage of rubber supplies, but with half the mar- ket eliminated by the control on exports the price movements reflected mainly variations in the exchange rate. Deal- ings in sugar, too, were typical of the present state of affairs. As the rules of the London sugar terminal mar- ket provide for the closing of all contracts on the outbreak of hostilities, fresh buying was dis- couraged and the only section to experi- ence any activity was that supplying white sugar for domestic consumption. Although sugar exports had not then been controlled, transport diffi- culties, and the withdrawal of British shipping from the Baltic and the Mediterranean severely limited activity.",

Expenses are on a slightly lower scale, even after the allocation of Â£45,000 special provision for stove relining. Net profit thus comes to Â£316,400, as compared with Â£839,100, and allows for the payment of 15 per cent., or 20 per cent. less on the shares, leaving Â£37,800, against less than Â£1,000, to go forward. The shares of 10 rupees (equivalent to 15s) were last quoted at 35s cum divi- dend to yield nearly 7 per cent. on the basis of the above dividend. The recession in international trade and the low level of American prices had an adverse influence upon busi- ness. In addition to this there was a decline in pig-iron output from 701,200 tons to 530,348 tons as a result of the total stoppage of work at the Kulti and Hirapur works following a prolonged strike. The production of casting and by-products suffered in sympathy. Hopes of a satisfactory settlement of the labour situation have not been realised. Good pro- gress has been made with the pro- gramme of the Steel Corporation of Bengal, which is intended to lessen the company's dependence on foreign markets.

It has been supplemented by a final of like amount, making 15 per cent. for the year, and absorbing Â£75,000 of the net profit of Â£93,400. For the previous year there was a loss of Â£5,900, arising from the excess of expenditure over revenue in the absence of a contribu- tion by the main subsidiary. Invest- ments held by the parent company amounted to Â£504,300 at the end of the last financial year in April, made up of Â£289,200 in Marsman and Co. and Â£215,100 in other investments. The market value of the quoted portion of these securities was Â£830,800. The operating company has interests in a number of gold-mining companies in the Philippine Islands, acting as manager, and also engages in general trading. It has lately been expanding operations with considerable success. There was a surplus at the close of the financial year amounting to Â£452,400, after paying a dividend of 5 pesos per share in December amounting to Â£94,000.

There is no indication that this advance is due to any intention to give some- thing more nearly approaching equality to the interim and final payments. It must be concluded, therefore that the shareholders are to enjoy some propor- tion at any rate of a continuing expan- sion of earnings. The company's net profits, after a dip of Â£8,400 in 1987 to Â£65,500, recovered sharply in 1988 to Â£95,800.

It means that this progressive motor-car producer, which, in spite of the popu- larity of its models, has failed to ensure sales sufficient to keep its works fully occupied, will pass into strong hands. Although it had managed to extend the basis of operations by securing work in connection with rearmament, the comr pany had evidently not quite that range of interests to compensate for the fall- ing off in motor-car sales. Thos. W. Ward is in a different position, having its roots in the heavy industries and a group of associated companies capable of supporting each other at many points. The company will be in a position to make good use of the Triumph assets and goodwill, the factories being capable of easily being adapted to a wide variety of motor-car, aircraft and medium engineering requirements. It is to be noted, however, that the pro- duction of Triumph cars is being con- tinued. These factories were reported by the valuers to be worth Â£305,200 as a going concern. The Triumph capital consists of Â£50,000 Preference and Â£250,000 Ordinary, the latter being dividendless since 1930, when 5 per cent. was paid, and the former in arrears since July, 1937.

Net profit was only Â£5,900, against Â£22,000, but the policy of carry- ing forward a large sum stood the com- pany in good stead. It now enables a dividend of 4 per cent. to be paid, against 7g per cent., although the amount required is short earned by some Â£4,000, and the carry-forward is correspondingly reduced by Â£4,000 to Â£37,700. Rubber export quotas aver- aged only 50 per cent. during the period covered by the company's financial year, which explains the drop from 2,106,000 Ibs to 1,320,000 Ibs in the crop accounted for. The better aver- age price of 8.62d London, against 8d, was inadequate to offset the smaller crop. Coffee, which is a substantial second string for the company, has been a dis- appointing crop for several years past. Not only was there a 'sharp decline in the crop, at 13,900 piculs, against 21,200 piculs, but the price realised fell from 12.77 florins to 10.66 florins per picul.

According to the report issued by the Imperial Economic Committee, Australia ap- pears to be on the way to recovering from the effects of drought in the 1938-39 season, which resulted in a fall of nearly 40 million lbs in wool production. All current indications point to the new season's clip being up to the average over the past seven seasons. In New Zealand the con- ditions have been reversed,. for the 1938-39 wool clip was over 30 million lbs higher than before, the total being a new record. In consequence of the decline in sheep numbers, however, this level is not expected to be main- tained in 1989-40. Both the U.S. and South Africa had good clips for 1938- 1939, though in the former case there was no appreciable increase in supplies. The U.K. had in June the largest number of sheep since 1982 and expects a larger wool production in consequence. Most of ,the, main wool importing countries increased their purchases in a marked fashion during January- July, 1989, as compared with the pre- vious year. Britain's import surplus rose from 420 million lbs to 555 mil- lions, that of France from 257 millions to 316 millions. Germany also imported more on balance, the increase being 15 million lbs at 202 millions. Warehouse stocks in the U.K. are unusually high and it is re- ported also that manufacturers' stocks are-. considerable, a reflection no doubt of the rising scale of business activity and private emergency precautions."

Merchants and shippers requiring information as to the facilities avail- able should make inquiries at this office through their usual insurance brokers. In accordance with the terms of the War Risks Cargo Pool Scheme, no war risks insurances will be accepted from 11 a.m. to-day for reinsurance by the Board of Trade under the scheme. CURRENT COVERS Sailings or departures by air or despatches by post after to-day under war risks insurances previously accepted will, however, remain in- sured if the sailing or departure or despatch takes place within 30 days from the acceptance of the risk by, or the declaration of the risk to, the underwriter. If the sailing or de- parture or despatch does not take place within 30 days the cargoes will cease to be insured. Declarations after 11 a.m. to-day under existing insurance contracts will be accepted in respect of sailings or departures by air or by post which have previously taken place. Where goods have been consigned for carriage by sea or by air from a place outside the United Kingdom, Isle of Man or Channel Islands to a place in any of those countries or from a place in any of those countries to a place out- side those countries and have by 11 a.m. to-day been discharged from their im- porting ship or aircraft, or despatched from the premises in any of the coun- tries from which they are conAigned, or where goods are so discharged or despatched within seven days after 11 a.m. to-day the owners will be entitled under the provisions of Section 3 of the War Risks Insurance Act, 1939, to claim compensation for any loss or damage in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man or Channel Islands in consequence of King's Enemy Risks. Such loss or damage must occur while the goods are in transit between the ship or aircraft from which they are discharged and their destination, or while the goods are in transit from the premises from which they are con- signed and the ship or aircraft. GOODS RISKS A scheme has been put into opera- tion by the Board of Trade under the War Risks Insurance Act whereby the Board undertakes, in relation to per- sons carrying on business in the United Kingdom as sellers of goods, the liability of insuring such persons against King's Enemy Risks in respect of goods insurable under Part 11 of the Act. The liability of the Board of Trade as insurers will be determined by a policy of insurance issued in a form prescribed in the schedule to the War Risks (Commodity Insurance) (No. 1) order. The rate of premium has been fixed at Â½ per cent. per month for a period of three months from 3rd September- the date declared by the Board of Trade to be the date of the outbreak of war-except for ships under con- struction. In this case it is fixed at J per cent. for a period of one month. The minimum premium payable will be 30s. Insurance is compulsory, except where the value of a person's insur- able goods does not exceed Â£1,000. Every person who being requirec' by the order to insure does not do so, is liable to a fine not exceeding Â£100 and a further fine not exceeding Â£50 for every day on which the contravention continues. EXCLUDED SUPPLIES Gas of the kind supplied by public utility undertakings, water and elec- tricity have been declared, by order of the Board, not to be goods insurable under Part II of the Act. Persons who have already made application to be registered for insur- ance will be covered subject to their remitting the appropriate premium to the corporation with which they have registered. Those who have not already done so should make applica- tion for insurance to any of the princi- pal fire insurance companies and the Society of Lloyd's. Persons selling agricultural pro- ducts produced by them will be re- quired to insure eggs, milk, butter, cereals, fruit, etc., if the value of the goods at any time exceeds Â£1,000. If the value is less than Â£1,000, they will not be required to insure, but may do so if they so wish. By virtue of a special provision in the Act they may, if they wish, insure certain agricultural products and live- stock which, but for this special pro- vision, they would, not be entitled to insure.",

   "text_content" : "MERGENCY measures fre- quently fit so well into the scheme of things that they are retained, perhaps in a modified form, after their primary cause has been removed. An example is the petrol distributing trade in this country, which has benefited ever since 1914-18 from the lessons learned during that period. The petroleum business of this coun- try was taken over by the Government in 1914 to the extent that the Govern- ment became the sole importer of oil products. Distribution was left to the existing companies, whose share of the trade was allocated by percentages and by geographical areas. Small towns were usually allotted to one company, while larger towns were divided between them. The Combine As a result of these arrangements the distributing companies became accustomed to a certain amount of co- operation in such matters as prices and their relations with the dealers and the public. Thus was born what is known as the \"Combine,\" which gives the British petrol market the reputation of being the most stable in the world. The three most important distribu- tors in 1914 were the Shell Marketing Company, the Anglo-American and the British Petroleum Company. In a slightly different form they constitute the backbone of the industry to-day. British Petroleum, in which German capital was interested, passed under the control of the Anglo-Persian Company -now Anglo-Iranian-in 1915. Two years after the war Shell Marketing became Shell-Mex by amalgamation with the British interests of Anglo- Mexican Petroleum. Eight years ago a further amalgama- tion resulted in the formation of Shell- Mex and B.P., which represents the British marketing organisation of the Shell and Anglo-Iranian groups. This company and Anglo-American now handle the bulk of the country's petrol. Railway Control IS it very fantastic to wonder whether an amalgamation of the four main line railway companies may be one of the eventual results of the present emergency? The. companies have been taken over by the .Government under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill and will be run by a Railway Execu- tive Committee under the direction of the Ministry of Transport. From its personnel I should imagine that the Committee will need little in the way of direction. It is made up of men whose joint experi- ence of \" playing trains \" could not be equalled anywhere. Back Into Harness . To be chairman of the Committee Sir Ralph Wedgwood has been called out of a retirement that has proved shortlived. He will probably be the last to grumble for he is one of the most energetic of men. It was only in March that he retired from the position of chief general manager of the L.N.E.R. Sir Ralph spent the last war in France. In 1916 he became Director of Docks, with the rank of Brigadier- General, under Sir Eric Geddes. With a staff of specialists and with head- quarters at Monthuis he overcame the difficulties that were arising through the serious congestion at the ports and organised a comparatively smooth flow of transport. He became noted on his visits to the ports for taking every opportunity for sea bathing. Summer or winter, calm or rough, nothing deterred him Serving under Sir Ralph on the new Committee are important executives of each of the main lines and of the London Transport Board. They in- clude his own successor at the L.N.E.R., Mr. C. H. Newton, who for the eight years to 1936 was the com- pany's chief accountant. Wot's Yer Number CATCHPHRASES become so quickly part of the language that their origin is soon forgotten. In case \" Wot's yer number?\" should become as popular as \"Where did you get that hat?\" and the like, I should like to put on record the origin of the first catchphrase of the present crisis. I heard it near the Strand. A blacked-out 'bus loomed out of the darkness to a stopping-place bearing no visible indication of its destination. The roar of \"Wot's yer number? \" was almost unanimous from the crowding would-be passengers and it was re- peated with growing enthusiasm to successive 'buses. I don't want to spoil the game before it has properly started, but I would suggest quite seriously that Mr. Frank Pick might give instructions for -'bus drivers and conductors to call out the number of their route at halts during black-out hours. It would save a lot of confusion. Observer",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL It was left entirely to the Money market and the foreign exchanges to keep the flag flying on Saturday morn- ing and this they proceeded to do in calm and orderly fashion. The lead- ing banks reported further demands It was left entirely to the Money market and the foreign exchanges to keep the flag flying on Saturday morn- ing and this they proceededt to do in calm and orderly fashion. The lead- ing banks reported further demands upon them for currency in connection with the evacuation and the general mobilisation of the fighting forces, but this did not entail them calling money from the discount market to any extent. During the crisis, the extent to which the banks have assisted in the task of financing bills, Treasury and otherwise, has varied rather con- siderably, but one institution particu- larly has been favourably mentioned without exception among discount houses. During Saturday's short session, loan conditions were comfort- able without money being all over the place, but there was always an alter- native outlet for bills if the occasion had risen. One of the surprising yet very sig- nificant facts about recent monetary eventss the remarkably small extent to which the London banks have been asked by their foreign clients to con- vert sterling into other currencies. Indeed, under the circumstances, pres- sure against the tpound has been most modest. As far as the exchanges were con- cerned on Saturday morning, business wa only of modest dimensions, but sterling was dearer in terms of Ameri- can and Canadian dollars and firm against French francs. Dealers were not disposed to extend commitments under the existing cir- cumstances. Everywhere there was an air of quiet confidence. Now and Then The latest return of the Reichsbank to 23rd August reveals a small increase in the gold and foreign exchange reserve to Rm.77,000,000, about Â£7,160,000 at the free reichsmark rate of exchange--for what it may be worth. In view of the march of events it may be interesting to compare this figure with that of the Reichsbank on the eve of the Great War. The actual statement for the third week of July, 1914, shows gold and silver valued at Â£84,569,800 at the normal rate of ex- change, while the gold and silver reserve of the Austro-Hungarian Bank amounted at that time to over .68,700,000, of which over Â£51,000,000 was in gold. The position now, therefore, is ex- tremely bad as compared with that of 25 years ago, while in addition Ger- many has not the same foreign assets which she can mobilise. Incidentally, the note circulation of the Reichsbank has risen over the past 12 months by more than 2.6 milliards to Rm.8,709,800,000 (about Â£810,000,000 at the current rate of exchange). This compares with only Â£94.5 millions on 23rd July, 1913. Milreis Exchange Unlike -the Argentine currency, Brazilian milreis is linked to the U.S. dollar and the basic official rate for the negotiation of 30 per cent. of ex- port bills in Brazil is unchanged at Rs.16$500 per dollar. On the other hand, the correspond- ing quotation for sterling, which fluctuates according to the London- New York cross-rate, has fallen from Rs.77$240 to Rs.69$300 per Â£. In the \"free\" market, where the remaining 70 per cent. of export bills is sold and where exchange cover for imports has to be obtained, the Bank of Brazil is now operating in U.S. currency only at Rs.19$950 per dollar-excluding the 5 per cent. tax-for its own collections and for certain daily quotas. No rates are quoted for sterling or European currencies, but, in order to avoid protest of bills falling due, de- posits in local currency are being accepted at rates ruling on 24th August. Other banks in Brazil are quoting about Rs.90$000 to the Â£ for their own sterling collections, but, for other transactions, the market is purely nominal. Sales of foreign ex- change by the banks are now pro- hibited.

   "text_content" : "Following Britain's declaration of war against Germany, the Government last night announced its war-time finance measures. They include any aid to acceptors of bills, restrictions on capital issues and regulations under which gold and foreign exchange are to be surrendered for sale to the Treasury. The Treasury, in conjunction with the Bank of England, has taken steps to ensure that the banks will be amply supplied with currency. BANKS CLOSE FOR ONE DAY To-day has been declared a limited Bank Holiday to enable banks to complete their measures for adapting themselves to the emergency. Only banks, the Post Office Savings Bank and other savings banks are affected. The arrangements which have been made will render un- necessary any general moratorium such as was adopted in August, 1914, but a Courts (Emergency Powers) Act has been passed to give further protection to anyone unable to meet his liabilities solely as a result of the emergency. Under the regulations regarding bills, the Bank of England will advance to acceptors where required funds to meet at maturity bills accepted before 3rd September. Interest on advances will be 2 per cent. above Bank Rate and in any event not below 6 per cent. No further capital issues will be permitted without Treasury consent and then only if they are considered advis- able in the national interest. The regulations covering holdings of gold and foreign exchange provide for sale to the Treasury of U.S. and Canadian dollars, Argentine pesos, belgas, guilders, Swiss and French francs, Swedish crowns and Norwegian kroner. No money, gold or securities may be sent abroad without Treasury permission. The transfer of securities payable in these currencies was prohibited a week ago, except with Treasury permission. STOCK EXCHANGE CLOSED TO-DAY The London Stock Exchange will remain closed to-day. The Settlement fixed for 7th September has been postponed to 21st September. The Emergency Committee of the Stock Exchange, under the chairmanship of Mr. R. B. Pearson, was in session during the week-end and the decision to close the House to-day was reached about 4 p.m. on Saturday. The Government's plans concerning advances to bill acceptors and capital issues were announced in the follow- ing statements by the Treasury:- The Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to announce that the following arrangements have been made with a view to maintaining essential sinan- cial services in the present emer- gency. These arrangements apply to approved acceptors whose bills are normally discounted in the London discount market, and are intended to supplement the general provisions em- bodied in the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act, 1939: DRAWERS AND ENDORSERS Cover Retained 1. The Bank of England will ad- vance, where required, to such acceptors through their bankers the funds necessary to pay at maturity all approved bills accepted before the third day of September, 1939. This course will release the drawers and endorsers of such bills from their liabilities as parties to these bills, but their liability under any agreement with'the acceptors for payment or cover will be retained. 2. The acceptors will be under obligation to collect as soon as pos- sible any amounts recoverable by them in respect of the transactions to which the bills relate and to apply such amounts to repayment of the advances made by the Bank of Eng- land. Interest- will be charged upon these advances at 2 per cent. above the ruling Bank Rate from time to time and in no case less than 6 per cent. The first interest payment will be on 1st March, 1940, and thereafter half-yearly on the 1st September and 1st March. Interest, if unpaid on the due dates, will be capitalised forthwith and interest thereon will be charged at the pre- vailing rate for the advance. 3. Advances and interest will constitute a floating charge on all the assets of acceptors in favour of the Bank of England ranking in priority to all other floating charges whether under Statute or other- wise on their assets. The Bank of England undertake. however, not (except in cases of insolvency or liquidation) to claim repayment of any amounts not recovered by the acceptors for a period of six months after such date as his Majesty may by Order in Council declare to be the date on which a state of war emergency has ceased to exist. CAPITAL ISSUES National Interest The notice as to control of fresh issues of capital stated: - 1. Until further notice and unless it falls within the classes of issues exempted by Treasury Order, no fresh issue of capital of whatever nature may be made without the consent of the Treasury. 2.

   "text_content" : "Regulations requiring that persons resident in the United Kingdom must offer, through their bankers, for sale to the Treasury any gold coin or bullion or foreign exchange at their disposal were issued by the Treasury last night. The foreign exchange to be offered for sale includes only such currencies as the Treasury may name from time to time. The following foreign curren- cies have already been so desig- nated: U.S. dollars, guilders, Canadian dollars, Argentine pesos, belgas, Swedish crowns, Swiss francs, Nor- wegian kroner and French francs. Holders may. however, apply through their bankers sor permission to retain gold and foreign exchange required to meet contracts made before the coming into force of these regulations, which provide for payments in gold or foreign exchange for meeting the reasonable requirements of trade or business or for reasonable travelling or other personal expenses. PRICES TO BE FIXED The prices to be paid for gold and foreign exchange are to be determined by or on behalf of the Treasury. Certain banks and institutions have been desig- nated as buyers on behalf of the Treasury, and the public are asked to deal direct with their usual bankers, who will pass on the offers, if necessary, to the right quarter. Until further notice exchange will be made available only for the following pur- poses: To enable a contract made before S.. to be complied with, to meet reason- able requirements of a trade or business carried on in the United Kingdom, or to defray reasonable travelling or other per- sonal expenses. The Treasury announcement added that the public should continue to transact busi- ness in foreign exchange and gold through the agency of their bankers. Foreign money order business in respect of small amounts will for the present be continued, and applications for exchange must be made by the applicant and satisfactory evidence in regard to the transaction pro- posed must be produced in all cases. For- ward exchange transactions are permitted only for genuine commercial purposes. Full details may be obtained from any bank and, in the case of travellers, from the travel agencies. The export of bank notes, gold, securi- ties or foreign currency is prohibited except with permission, for which applica- tion should be made to a bank. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1",

Business was transacted in American and Canadian dollars and certain of the European group, principally French and Swiss francs and Belgian belgas, U.S. dollars were offered from a quarter which suggested operations against gold. The Canadian dollar depreciated. Apart from French francs, , which tended to weaken and were controlled by the authorities, the \"free\" Continental currencies were adverse to sterling. Dealers were unwilling to extend commit- ments more than they were compelled during this present anxious time. Most of the leading banks reported that they had received few advices from abroad to convert sterling into other currencies. WIDE FLUCTUATIONS The American dollar touched extremes of $4.25 and $4.15 and closed a cent cheaper on balance at $4.20, but Canadian dollars depreciated 8 cents to $4.36%. No forward quotations were available. Control supplied French francs at 175%, closing rate of 175% was unchanged on balance. Belgas were harder at 22%. Credit conditions were comfortable, although there was rather more demand for accommodation. The evacuation and mobilisation caused a demand for currency, but funds of banks were helped by the Public Departments' release of credit and by maturing Treasury bills.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 3rd Sept. There was another burst of buying in the Stock Market early yesterday, but profit-taking set in later and caused an irregular close. Steels, Coppers and Air- crafts were again strong. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing index advanced 2.84 to 138.09, Rails only gained 0.25 to 26.18. and Utilities lost 0.18 at 23.41. Of the huge two-hour turnover of 1,790,000 shares, 1,020,000 changed hands in the first hour. The recent action of the market does not offer any definite indications for the future. It is noticeable that the Industrial average continues to move within the in- decisive range of 130-140. The significance of the action seems rather to lie in the fact that it disposes of apprehensions that the shock to the invest- ment world of actual warfare would cause heavy unloading of securities and possibly result in a situation such as prevailed in 1914 when the Exchanges were forced to close. It is also important that several lines of industry are actually showing signs of increased demand, largely from domestic sources owing to fears that foreign orders will advance prices.

   "text_content" : "Traders, shipowners and others are warned in an announcement issued by the Board of Trade that as from the outbreak of war it is unlawfu: to transact business or to have other dealings with enemies without official permission (which will not be granted save in exceptional circumstances). Offenders will be liable to heavy penalties. The term \" enemy \" may be assumed to cover: (a) Governmental agencies in enemy territory; (b) Any person or busi- ness resident or established in enemy territory; (c) Any branch (in any country) controlled from a principal place of busi- ness in enemy territory; and (d) Any company or other body of persons which is constituted or incorporated under enemy law. It does not, however, include any person by, reason only that he is a national of an enemy country. \" Enemy territory \" in- cludes any territory in the occupation of the enemy's armed forces. NO DEBTS TO BE PAID In particular, traders and other persons are warned:- Not to pay, lend or send money or securities to or for the benefit of an enemy or to a place in enemy territory; not to discharge any debt due to an enemy which the enemy has assigned to a neutral assignee; Not to accept any payment from an enemy of money due in respect of a trans- action unless all obligations on the part of the person receiving payment had been completed before the outbreak of war; not to trade in. or carry, any goods consigned to or from an enemy or destined for or coming from enemy territory. In the case of business transacted before the outbreak of war with agencies or branches in enemy territory which traded solely for the account of a parent firm or company whose principal place of business is in allied or neutral territory, objection will not be raised to the settlement of out- standing debts, on demand, by remittances to the principal place of business. If, how- ever, the agency or branch in enemy territory was so constituted that it could have sued for the debt in its own name, payment must not be made to any person whatsoever except with the permission of the trading with the enemy branch. INSURANCE PREMIUMS The payment of life assurance premiums and fees in respect of patents, designs and trade-marks, both (a) in this country on behalf of enemies and (b) in enemy countries on behalf of persons here will be licensed under certain conditions. Correspondence with enemies on busi- ness matters will be permitted in approved cases, but communications will not be passed by the censorship authorities except with the prior approval of the Trading with the Enemy Branch. All communications relating to trading with the enemy (including applications for licenses to transact business otherwise prohibited), should be addressed to the Trading with the Enemy Branch (Treasury and Board of Trade); or, in the case of communications regarding patents, designs or trade-marks, to the Patent Office. The address of the Trading with the Enemy Branch is Western Galleries, Imperial Institute, Exhibition-road, South Kensington, S.W.7.",

The dividend is in accordance with market estimates as indicated by \"Veritas\" in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Saturday.

   "text_content" : "The following list of securities deemed to be affected by the Treasury Order prohibiting the sale of certain foreign securities except with the per- mission of the authorities is a revised version of that published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Thursday.
