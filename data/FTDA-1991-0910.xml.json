   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson and Ivo Dawnay THE UK economy is \"back or course\", Mr John Major said yesterday as news of unexpect- edly strong high street spend ing in July lifted government hopes that a recovery is at hand. The prime minister also warned that mounting media speculation of an election in early November, fuelled by opinion polls showing the Con servative party narrowly in the lead over Labour, was prema ture. \"Polls go up and they go down. I am surprised everyone is getting so excited,\" he told Scottish Tories in Aberdeen. \"I'm in no hurry.\" His remarks came as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, speaking at his party's conference in Bournemouth, challenged Mr Major to confirm the timing for a general election. Mr Major outlined the gov- ernment's crowded agenda and stressed the need to negotiate a successful agreement with European Community partners on economic and political union at the Maastricht sum- mit in December. Buoyed by yesterday's retail sales figures, Mr Major claimed that economic growth had resumed an upward path. \"Inflation has virtually halved since last October and falling inflation has enabled us to lower interest rates - a fur- ther 0.5 per cent last week good news for homeowners and businessmen,\" he said. Labeur rube out targe en ebe ..................................Page Lberrl Demnrale' -onfere rporte.......Page 8 Je Bkgl l ....................Page 15 Lea ............................... Page 18 Labour rejected the Tories' growing optimism on the econ- omy, saying there were no signs of a let-up in the reces sion. Unemployment figures on Thursday are expected to show another monthly rise of 60,000, taking the jobless total to 2.4m in August. As Mr Major spoke of a return of confidence on his tour of north-east Scotland, the Treasury welcomed as \"very encouraging\" the news, from he Central Statistical Office, that the rise in retail sales vol- umes in July had been revised upwards to 0.7 per cent. After the revised increase rom July's 0.3 per cent provi- sional estimate and June's sharp 1.5 per cent rise, the revi- sion added to \"accumulating evidence that there was a bit of an upwards trend,\" the Trea- sury said. This trend was marred by he spring distortions to the etail sales volumes caused by the anticipation of the value added tax increase in March. Volumes in the three months o July were 0.4 per cent below evels in the three months to ApriL But over the six months to July, volumes were 0.6 per cent hiher than for the previous six months, backing govern- ment hopes that a recovery is under way. The Retail Consortium, an organisation representing about 90 per cent of the retail ing industry, gave the figures a less enthusiastic reception. It reserved judgment until the next set of \"doubtful\" retail =ales figures from the Central Statistical Office were due out in a week's time. However, the consortium agreed that the figures bore \"out the impression that the non-food retailers are recover- ing and that the corner is being turned\". The government was not able to draw much comfort from July's credit figures. These showed a growth of Â£187m in new credit to consum- ers in July, against 22m in June. The figures are volatile and the Treasury did not include them in the series of economic indicators which it claims dem- onstrate the so-called \"virtuous circle\" - good economic news fuelling consumer confidence. One striking feature was the heavy use of credit cards. Mr Nell Mackinnon, econo- mist at Yamaichi Securities, said that talk of recovery had to be kept in perspective when yesterday's figures showed that credit card debt was sinan- cing high street spending - not a steady growth in consumers' incomes."

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow RUSSIA cannot begin the process of economic reform unless the west agrees urgent assistance to ensure that the country survives the winter, according to Mr Yevgeny Sabu- rov, the Russian economics minister. Mr Saburov also warned that Russia would soon cease to provide energy and other resources to other republics at subsidised prices - moving instead to charging world prices for oil, gas, coal and other supplies. He spelt out the harder line of the Russian leadership - now very much in control at the Union level - as foreign ministers arrived in Moscow for the opening of the 35-nation Corerence on Security and Co-operation today. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany was the first to see Soviet president Mikhail Gorb- achev, but he and others including Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, are known to be keen to forge closer links with Russian president Boris Yelt- sin and the leaders of other republics. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said Chancellor Helmut Kohl would appeal to President George Bush for the US to channel aid to the Soviet Union during talks in Washing- ton next Monday. This emerged as Mr Gorba- chev set in train efforts to stimulate foreign investment, with plans to send close aides to six Middle East countries and to Germany to ask for short-term assistance. Mr Vitaly Churkin, foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr Alexander Yakovlev and Mr Yevgeny Primakov would \"see what can be generated in terms of co-operation with these countries\". Mr Saburov, meanwhile, said he and Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, had pressed the issue of aid on Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and on Mr Pierre B6r- dgovoy, the French finance minister, during their recent trips to Moscow. He indicated that their appeal had received a sympathetic ear. The Russian approach is encouraged by growing fears that the coming winter will see a breakdown in supplies. Mr Saburov said \"stupid\" former leadership had \"reduced us to Continued on Page 16 Soviet break-up, Page 2 Russia binds reform to aid from west c-i...mro- P uin.

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston and Roland Rudd BRENT WALKER moved closer to receivership last night after holders of its bonds refused to drop their opposi- tion to the troubled leisure group's reconstruction plan and continued to support an alternative takeover offer from Lonrho, the international trad- ing group. Touche Ross, the accoun- tancy firm, has been standing by to be appointed as receivers to the company, which has debts of Â£Ubn. However, one banker said the company had experienced such brinkman- ship before and receivership was not inevitable. Earlier in the day, Standard Chartered, the bank leading a steering committee of principal lenders to Brent Walker, informed holders of Â£100m in convertible bonds that they must give support for the reconstruction plan, or see the company go into receivership. Mr Eric Naslund, the bead of Standard's corporate recon- struction unit, delivered this stark message to the main Londholders at the ofices of Hambros, the merchant bank which is a 4 per cent bon. holder and coordinator of the biggest bondholders. But at 7.30pm the bond holders delivered a letter to the bank steering committee say- ing that \"more than 25 per cent of bondholders by value were unable\" to support the recon struction proposals. A 75 per :ent majority of bondholders is needed before the reconstruc ion can go through. In particular, they refused to promise they would not a: some future date sue the cor- pony in connection with its alleged overstatement of last year's interim results. The anks have insisted that the: bandholder give this waiver. The biggest bondholders were at the meetlng, nncdin epresentatives Mr Michael Smurfit, the Irish busine-- man, and Jefferson Smurfi, his company, which together own 25 per cent of the bonds. Mr Georse Walker, the deposed chief executive of Brent Walker whose family controls 27 per cent, was also there, as was a representative of Svenska International, whose clients control more than 10 per cent. Lonrho, also present, holds 5 per cent. \"We all agreed to issue the statement,\" said one bond- holder. A member of the steering committee commented: \"The banks are no longer afraid to put the company into receiver- ship. The gap between what we lose if the company stays afloat or it goes down is not so great. But the bondholders would be wiped out by recelv- eabhip.\" However, Lonrho was keep ing up its campaign to press Brent Walker's banks to con- aider its takeover offer. Mr Pul Spicer, a Lourho director, warned members of the stsaing committee that they culd be sued by shareholders and bondholders if they rfused to circulate Lonrho's ropos to all 47 of Brent wawe balnk&"

   "text_content" : "By Andrew HIII in Brussels WEAKER European Commun- ity economies should be tempo- rarily excused from meeting strict economic conditions for monetary union, and not left behind in a two-speed move to Emu, the Dutch presidency of the EC indicated yesterday. Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister, was explain- ing the presidency's position after a draft treaty prepared by the Netherlands was yesterday attacked by some EC finance ministers and the European Commission for increasing the possibility of a two-speed mon- etary union. Mr Kok appeared to disown the draft treaty which he said was a technical paper prepared to prompt discussion. Accord- ing to the draft, strong econo- mies would be able to move from the second transitional phase of Emu to full currency union ahead of their weaker counterparts. The draft treaty had already received the guarded support of the UK and Germany, while Italy and some southern EC countries objected to imposi- tion of strict economic condi- tions. But after yesterday's ministerial meeting of the intergovernmental conference Continued on Page 16 Dutch call to strengthen powers of Strasbo rg, Page 3 Emu Continued from Page 1 on Emu, Mr Kok said: \"It's a technical paper not approved by me. It's a stepping stone.\" The Netherlands expects to table a formal draft treaty before the end of next month. Mr Kok suggeted that member states would still have to meet strict conditions, but said he favoured derogations for the laggards rather than a two-tier league. \"A Europe of the 12 [member states] is a pattern which has to be preferred to a two-speed configuration\" he said yester- day. \"Throughout the progress to convergence we would like to eep the group as tightly knit together a possible and if some country lacks the strength or the power [econom- ically] we should create condi- tions where such a country could be allowed to catch up later.\" Earlier, Italy had dismissed the Netherlands' technical pro- posals as \"unacceptable\". Mr Jacques Deors, president of the European Commission, also attacked the Dutch paper, saying that a two-speed approach would be politically unacceptable.

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow THE times may have changed but the Soviet habit of approaching economic reform crabwise rather than head-on has not. No fewer than three teams are now working on a pro- gramme which would provide the basis for the Inter-Republi. can Economic Committee - which will soon take over the functions of the Union minis- tries, for which there is still a need. The purpose of the plans is to define under what terms the republics can co-operate. All three schemes accept that the republics are not necessarily part of a political union, and that they, rather than an autonomous and powerful cen- tre, should be in charge of their mutual affairs. Beyond that they differ radi- cally, and in their difference lies the core of the debate about the future, or lack of future, of the Soviet Union. Under one plan a loose Union is proposed, seeking to accommodate states pulling away from the centre but still reluctantly yoked together by economic backwardness; while under another there would be common budgetary, monetary and fiscal policies, and com- mon bodies with real power. At the poles of the debate are two former collaborators; Professor Stanislav Shatalin, an author of the 500day plan for reform, turned down last year by the Soviet government, and his then colleague, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, now a member of the Committee for the Management of the National Economy. Between them is a compro- mise plan drawn up by Mr Yev- geny Saburov, the Russian eco- nomics minister, whose academic career was spent in the same Central Mathematical Institute in which Prof Shat- alin has worked for many years. Prof Shatalin has proposed as permissive a structure as could be imagined. He has drawn up a conven- tion on the creation of an eco- nomic community: it has three levels of membership - full, associate and observer - and is open to the east European states whose economies were so closely integrated with those of the Soviet Union through Comecon. He lays most emphasis on developing and sustaining mar- ket relations within each par- ticipating state and among them. One of the few unambig- uous obligations of full mem- bership is to \"give legal guar- antees to private enterprise \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Grigory Yavlinsky (left) and Stanislav Shatalin: former colleagues turned economic adversaries and render al assistance to its development\". Further, the members must guarantee - at least after a transitional period - free flow of goods between them and should all adopt similar, anti- monopoly guidelines. However, they need not all have the same currency, though those which do would form a bank ing union in which the central bank of each republic would participate, functioning as a type of Union central bank. Agreements would be super vised by a Council of the Union, whose chairman would rotate among republic leaders every six months. Under this would be an economic commit tee, with a chairman and dep uty chairman elected on four year terms, which would do much of the work. Supplementing these would be a court of arbitration and a development bank for inter-re- publican investment. Mr Yavlinsky's version is uncompromising: there must be a strong and coherent eco nomic union. The state bank would be preserved and would have the full powers of a nor- mal federal reserve bank over money and credits. A single currency would be preserved at least until the rouble was made convertible. The importing of goods would be under the control of the cen- tral authorities, as would the servicing of foreign debt. This plan, unveiled last Thursday at the State Council - currently the supreme Union executive body - has not yet been publicly revealed in detail. But Mr Yavlinsky has not departed far fom the ideas he developed in the Window of Opportunity programme he drew up in May with scholars from Harvard University, in which he called for a unified market and a common legal and monetary framework as a necessary precondition for reform. Mr Saburov's proposa., drawn up with Mr Alexander Granberg, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee of inter-republican relations, draws from both plans. He too sees the possibility of the for- mer Comecon partners' partici- pation in the new Union, but he lays greatest stress on the need to liberalise prices, albeit in a phased manner. First, he says, the trade between republics should be priced at \"contract\" prices = that is, at prices agreed between buyer and seller but \"set with a view to world prices\". In other words, Mr Saburov's plan - described by Mr Ivan Silayev, the prime minister, as the must Russian of the vari- ants - would capitalise on Russia's advantage as the pro ducer and exporter of most energy resources, by moving the price of these resources sharply higher. The plan sees the need for common infrastructures in energy, transport and commu- nications, together with a coc ordinated tax policy and social security systems. In the short term, however the worst of the economic cri sis should be mitigated by preserving the administrative links between enterprises, reducing republic budget defi cits by cutting social pro- grammes, and ending all forms of barriers on the transporta- tion of goods across republic boundaries. If Mr Saburov's plan is the most Russian, Mr Yavllnsky's is the most international, since it best answers the fears of western governments and investors that there will not be a coherent centre with which to negotiate. Professor Shat- alin's scheme is the most republican, playing to the inde- pendence lobby and has already been well received by republican representatives. In a week it should be known which plan is consid- ered the strongest.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholson in Moscow THE Soviet Union no longer considers foreign concern over human rights issues to be interference in its domestic affairs, Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, deputy Soviet foreign minister, said yesterday, effectively burying 70 years of stonewall- ing over civil rights issues. Mr Petrovsky's remarks came as foreign ministers from 35 countries arrived in Moscow for today's opening of the Con- ference on Security and Co-operation in Europe's meet- ing on the Human Dimension. It is the first internationally acknowledged human rights conference on Soviet soil in seven decades. The foreign ministers' first action today will be formally to admit the Baltic states of Lith- uania, Latvia and Estonia as full members of the CSCE. Mr Petrovsky's declaration was clearly designed to present today's conference with the Soviet Union's most liberal, western face after a long con- troversy over whether the meeting should be hosted in a country with an appalling dis- regard for human rights. His remarks were immedi- ately hailed by the US delega- tion to the meeting. Mr Steny Hoyer, chairman of the US group, called the statement \"a radical change consistent with the radical changes now in this country\", adding \"if our delegation had heard no other assertion, that alone would have made our visit a success\". Mr Hoyer said his group had visited the three Baltic states, Armenia and Georgia over the past six days and found respect for human rights to be \"radi- cally better than ever in the lifetime of any member of the delegation\". However, asserting that observance of human rights in the Soviet Union was \"better, but not perfect\", he said his delegation would present to the conference a list of 100 peo- ple he claimed had been deprived of exit visas for \"arbi- trary reasons\". The delegation would also raise the question of remaining political prisoners in Russia, which the US State Depart- ment believes now number fewer than 10. In an indication that human rights in the Soviet republics could dominate proceedings over the next month, Mr Hoyer strongly criticised Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, president of Georgia. He said the US delega- tion left the republic \"very depressed\" at the president's attempts to stifle opposition and consolidate power.",

   "text_content" : "By Ollmn TOM in Vilnius Concern grows over Polish and Russian rights as post-independence euphoria fades T THE Central Russian Language School in Vil- nius a yellow, green and red Lithuanian national flag is flying - a small sign that some Lithuanian Rus- sians, at least, want to be seen supporting the republic's new- ly-won independence. But as independence celebra- tions die down, the Lithuanian leadership's treatment of its 17 per cent Polish and Russian minority looks likely to be an acid test of its attempt to implement western-style democracy. There are fears, not only among Lithuania's minority but also political factions opposing Mr Vytautas Lands bergis, the Lithuanian presi- dent, that the wave of post- coup recriminations, coupled with now-triumphant Lithua- nian natonalism, will hamper political reform in the most volatile of the Baltic republics. \"We may have got Indepe- dnce here, but we havent ot dmoracy yet,\" said Mr Aviset Brdla , Poldsh head of the Vilalus regional council.

U~Labia eOkasb my the mieemU o the larely Po ish councils is a temporary measure while six council lead- ers are investigated for alleg- edly supporting the Moscow coup attempt. But Polish deputies of the Lithuanian parliament say they are victims of a new wave of animosity. Unlike the Rus- sian minority, which arrived in Lithuania after Soviet annex- ation, Poles have lived there for centuries and consider parts of Lithuania rightfully theirs. The raising of the minorities issue so soon after Moscow's recognition of Lithuania's ine- pendence could prove mbr- rasing to the Lithuanian lead ersip, not least because the latest round of foreign ddele tions visiting Vilnius include a group from Helsinki Watch the inkaratonal human rigbb Mr Gerald Naler, secretary of the 1Heinki Watch, attend Sa congres In Vilnius ald: \"We want to mae ear that the repuabN csou out of to Sovit Union s l hd e am - ing to CSCB standards or human rigin\" Other delates sad tAhe hoped to Invstigate 4alm tanes sar ow id e rals Lowman ne elo we 10 Second World War.

   "text_content" : "PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev is sending two top envoys to Germany and the Middle East to seek economic help, in a clear sign the Krem- lin is increasingly worried about shortages this winter, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said yes- terday that Mr Gorbachev would send Mr Alexander Yakovlev to Germany and Mr Yevgeny Primakov to six coun- tries in the Middle East. \"The aim of the visits is to see what can be generated in terms of co-operation with these countries in order to alle- viate the economic situation in the Soviet Union,\" he later told reporters. \"We'd like to ensure we have done all we can in order to alleviate the possible hardships as we look [ahead] to the diffi cult and long winter.\" Tass news agency earlier announced that Mr Primakov - Moscow's peace envoy in the build-up to the Gulf war - would leave today for Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iran and Turkey. An emergency committee was formed on Saturday to try to overcome a \"catastrophic situation\" and guarantee that basic food supplies reach the Soviet capital. The head of the committee said supplies were so poor and agriculture around the city in such a state it was possible Moscow could be with- out reserves of potatoes this winter. Mr Churkin, who denied sug- gestions the envoys were on purely aid-seeking missions, said co-operation was needed in food supplies and distribu- tion as well as supplies of med- ication. \"Maybe there are other things which could help improve the situation,\" he added. Last year many western countries sent food aid to the Soviet Union to overcome shortages, with Germany playing a leading role.",

   "text_content" : "By David Buchan in Tallinn MR Frans Andriessen, European Community external affairs commissioner, yester- day told ministers from the three newly-independent Bal- tic states that the EC wanted relations with them to develop \"step by step\". He said Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania must settle for a first-generation agreement on trade and economic co-opera- tion, which would help them restructure their economies, before they could obtain the formal association with the EC to which they aspire. The Community was \"pre- pared to enter into contractual relations with you as soon as possible, but this must be done step by step,\" Mr Andriessen said. EC officials told Baltic ministers that their countries could get a share of the Ecu400m (Â£279.2m) technical aid earmarked by Brussels for the Soviet Union this year, but that they must present pro- jects on which it could be spent. Baltic leaders placed more emphasis on asking for aid than for concessions on their trade, which they accept will stay intertwined with Soviet republics for some time. The only jarring note came when an Estonian minister asked for special textile quotas in the EC market, and was told by an embarrassed Mr Andriessen that the Baltics would be better advised to find eastern markets for such goods. The EC is already struggling to give central European tex- tiles a better deal in the con- text of association status for Poland, Hungary and Czecho- slovakia. Mr Ivars Godmanis, the Lat- vian prime minister, responded to EC cautioning not to move too fast by saying the Soviet Union's recent infla- tionary practice of printing roubles to cover its budget def- icit reinforced the need for the Baltic states to adopt new national currencies. He surprised his EC audi- ence by claiming that, even at realistic prices for Russian energy, the Baltic states had an effective trade surplus with the Soviet Union, because they produced relatively more fin- ished goods with a higher added value. No -Baltic state had a budget deficit, Mr God- manis said. EC officials go on to Riga and Vilnius later this week, but it is already clear the new states look to Brussels for help with currency creation and stabilisation, as well as techni- cal aid in running market economies. Mr Andriessen said he thought the Baltic states should crown whatever trade co-operation they could agree on \"with a very strong frame- work of monetary co-opera- tion\", as the EC was doing. Mr Maris Gailis, Latvian trade minister, said his coun- try needed a special short-term credit for \"machinery for printing money, and for secu- rity paper for passports and shares as well as currency\". This might come from the EC, or perhaps from the Interna- tional Monetary Fund or the European Bank for Recon- struction and Development, which the Baltic states hope to join soon. \"We also need new uniforms for police and border guards,\" the minister said. At the moment western banks only recognise the credit guarantee of Vneshekonombank, the Soviet foreign trade bank, which is no longer applicable to the free Baltics. Reuter reports from Washing- ton: Estonia has formally applied to join the Interna- tional Monetary Fund, the Fund said last night. An IMF official said consideration of such applications usually takes several mouths. Reuter reports from Havana: Cuba yesterday recognised the independence of Estonla, Lat- via and Lithuania."

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Parkes in Bonn A FRESH wave of optimism over economic prospects in east Germany swept through Bonn yesterday. Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a meeting of unions and employers that only 11 months after reunifica- tion the economic decline was ending and the upswing was on the way. Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, later declared the trend was \"clearly upwards\" and Mr Jfrgen M1llemann, economics minister, insisted that growth of 10 per cent in 1992 was \"absolutely realistic\". ISO, the authoritative Munich-based economic research institute, topped up the enthusiasm with a forecast of a 10 to 15 per cent surge in construction expenditure in the former GDR next year. Mr Vogel added that the west German mechanical engi- neering industry planned to invest more than DM7bn (Â£2.3bn) in the region, and the auto industry between DM8bn and DMO1bn. Despite the chan- cellor's careful choice of words, his statement, taken together with the contributions from Mr Vogel and Mr M6llemann, indi cates a consensus that the awaited \"upswing east\" is under way. Mr Kohl has been downbeat about prospects in the five eastern LAnder since the over- optimistic forecasts he made shortly after unification. He found added grounds for opti- mism in a separate ISO analy sis which reported improving performance in the services sectors and modest advances in industrial output. The Soviet Union, which had given undertakings to buy DM12bn of east German exports, had already put in orders this year for DM9bn w'orth, and financing for DM6br was in place, he added"

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels THE Dutch presidency of the European Community wants to boost the powers of the Eurc pean Parliament, giving it the -ight to veto almost all EC leg islation by the 12 member states, or Council of Ministers. The proposal is contained in an unpublished working docu- ment likely to be put to the inter-governmental conference on political union currently trying to forge agreement or changes to the Treaty of Rome The Dutch idea goes much further than proposals by Lux- embourg, the last member to hold the six-month rotating presidency, which advocated giving the Strasbourg assem- bly the last legislative say in five areas. The plan is bound to sharpen differences among the Twelve about the so-called \"democratic deficit\" - how to strengthen accountability at a time when Brussels is acquiring more powers. And it will also polar- ise debate in the run-up to the December European summit in Maastricht, by when the EC is supposed to agree or blue- prints for both political union and economic and monetary union (Emu). Both sets of negotiations are beset by difficulties. The two main obstacles to an accord on political union are the powers of Strasbourg and the extent to which the Twelve should pool sovereignty in a common for- eign and security policy. Germany has made clear that it regards a much- strengthened parliament as an indispensable condition for agreeing to Emu, which would entail surrendering the D-Mark and the now dominant role of the Bundesbank in European monetary policy to a future single currency and a Euro- pean central bank. Italy also strongly backs a beefed up Euro-legislature. The UK is set against dilut- ing the powers of national par- liaments, wanting to give Strasbourg the role of greater scrutiny over the Brussels Commission. France, which has gone to great lengths to keep the parliament in Stras- bourg for prestige, neverthe- less wants to keep it toothless although it is likely to compro mise in order to get full Ger man endorsement of Emu. Strasbourg currently plays little more than an advisory role in EC lawmaking, and its amendments need the support of the Commission. The Dutch Plan would give the 518 Stras bourg MEPs the right to veto all legislation the Council approves by majority vote. The Luxembourg plan suggested veto rights on the environ- ment, infrastructure, high technology research, and aid in and outside the EC. The Dutch refinements simultaneously advocate that a great deal more EC legislation is subject to majority voting - now used for Single Market laws and directives in areas like environment and social policy which are judged essen- tial for a barrier-free Commu- nity. If the Twelve were to agree on the proposals by December, the Commission's hand would thus also be strengthened, since it has the sole right of proposing laws.",

   "text_content" : "By Laura Sllber in Belgrade CROATIA ordered an overnight curfew in its war zones last night because of worsening ethnic strife and said it would step up its weap- ons production to counter the effects of an arms embargo. i The Croatian Interior Minis try said the curfew would be enforced in towns including Osijek, Karlovac and Zadar, which were under threat from Serbian guerrillas and the Yugoslav army. The rebel republic's deputy interior minister, Mr Milan Brezak, said Kostajnica, 50km south-east of Zagreb, was under attack for a second day by guerrillas. The Zagreb authorities claim 58 Croats have died in violations of a week-old ceasefire negotiated by the European Community. Fighting continued for con- trol of the motorway between Zagreb and Belgrade which the guerrillas and army blocked last week in an attack that severed eastern Croatia from the rest of the republic. In Osijek, the eastern region's capital, the army accused Croatian forces of attacking its barracks with mortars despite the presence in A couple shopping in the town of Osijek during a break from duty in the Croatian National Guard the town of five EC ceasefire monitors. They are the first EC observers to be deployed in a Croatian battle zone since western European countries embarked on a peace-keeping role in Yugoslavia. In announcing the step- ping-up of arms production, the vice-president of Croatia, Mr Zdravko Tomac, said the republic would strengthen its defences while adhering to \"peaceful politics agreed with the European Community\". Mr Tomac said Croatia would pro- duce its own weapons \"to defend ourselves more effi- ciently while there is an arms embargo [in effect since last May]\". Amid intense civil defence preparations in Zagreb, Mr Luka Bebic, Croatia's defence minister, warned that the republic would go on the offensive if EC peace efforts failed. The federal prime minister, Mr Ante Markovic, whose gov- ernment has been sidelined by the conflict between Serbia and Croatia, appealed to both republics to observe the cease fire. He set up a commission to. investigate violations and said he would reshuffle his cabinet to try to rebuild its authority. In the southern republic of Macedonia, unofficial results of a referendum showed that its people had overwhelmingly voted for independence."

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent PART OF Nato's new rapid-deployment force begins its first practical trial today, barely three months after allies agreed on a post-Cold War reorganisation involving multinational troop formations. British, German and Belgian troops will carry out an evaluation exercise for the Multinational Airmobile Division in north- ern Germany, in a sharply reduced series of Nato autumn manoeuvres. The idea of a four-nation airmobile divi- sion, relying on helicopters to provide transport and supporting firepower, was frst put forward in 1988 as an operational reserve for Nato's Northern Army Group. The division is now seen as a key ele- ment in the new Rapid Reaction Corps to be set up under Allied Command Europe. Expected to be about 15,000strong, it is due to incorporate troops from the Nether- lands as well as the other three countries. It is designed to be able to deploy quickly to a range of up to 120km and to sustain itself in battle for 48 hours. The aim of the exercise is to try out the con- cept using existing units - UK and Ger- man airmobile brigades and Belgium's \"para-commando\" regiment. Still to be resolved is the delicate ques- tion of who will command the new divi- sion. The trials are being held under the command of Major General Michael Rose, commander of the UK's 2nd Infantry Divi- sion and a former director of special forces. However, UK leadership would mean that three of the four divisions planned for the Rapid Reaction Corps, as well as the corps itself, would be headed by British officers. The idea of British-led corps is under- stood to have come from US General John Galvin, Nato's supreme commander in Europe. But the high profile assumed by the UK caused discomfort among German officials when plans for the new force were drawn up in May. Apart from its role in the airmobile division, the UK is to pro vide a German-based armoured divisior and a UK-based mechanised divisior backed up by paratroops and, if necessary, Royal Marine commandos. A fourth division is due to be formed by southern European Nato allies. The airmobile trial is part of Exercise Certain Shield 91, involving about 28,000 allied troops. In order to reduce the nui sance to civilians, numbers of vehicles and helicopters have been sharply reduced from previous levels, and no tanks will take part. In line with Nato's efforts to stop identi fying the Soviets as the enemy, the troops opposing Nato's \"blue\" forces are no lon- ger designated as \"red\" or \"orange\" but as \"old forces\".",

In the past, France has excluded its nuclear forces from arms control negotia- tions between the two super- powers. President Mitterrand has refused to take part such talks until the arsenals of the superpowers should have been scaled down to a size compara- ble to that of France. France may cut corporation tax The French government is con- sidering making cuts in corpo- ration tax in its 1992 budget, scheduled to be published next week, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The proposal contrasts with the general tightening of bud- getary policy due to the squeeze on tax revenues imposed by the economic slow- down. It is understood that an interministerial committee has proposed that the twin corpo- ration tax rates - 34 per cent on retained earnings and 42 per cent on distributed profits - should both be reduced to 33.3 per cent.

   "text_content" : "Nakasone: acrimonious battle Takesnta:r vais are angry R Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime min- ister, has been the subject of ridicule in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ever since he took office. MPs have constantly jibed at his lack of personal power, deriding him as a puppet of the party's real leaders. But the attacks of the last two years will pale in comparison with the abuse Mr Kaifu will face in coming weeks, as party chiefs battle over who is to become LDP leader and prime minister when Mr Kaifu's term expires at the end of October. Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former prime minister, offered a taste of what is to come in a speech over the weekend when he alluded to Mr Kalfu as a \"rookie\" and a \"relief pitcher\" - wrongly sent in to play for Japan at a time of interna- tional crisis. Mr Nakasone's remarks are a sign that this year's leader- ship battle is likely to be par- ticularly acrimonious. As well as Mr Kaifu's own record, the Recruit bribery scandal of 1989, the current financial scandals, and political and financial reform are likely to figure prominently in the arguments. The LDP fatollne (NuImnber MPs) KWalmote rners 43 But the real issue will be the competing strengths of the leaders of the LDP's four big- gest factions - Mr Noboru Takeshita, Mr Kiichi Miya- zawa, Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, and Mr Michio Watanabe. Mr Takeshita, de facto head of the largest faction, has been the power behind Mr Kaifu's throne. Prime minister during the Recruit affair, he was forced to resign to defuse pub- lic criticism and looked around for a malleable nominee. When his first choice Mr Sousuke Uno let him down, having got himself involved in a sex scan- dal, he turned to Mr Kalfu. Mr Kaifu has succeeded very well in the two tasks Mr Tak- eshita assigned to him - win- ning back public confidence in the LDP and acting as a front for Mr Takeshita's influence. Mr Kaift has been happy to do this since it has given m- the premiership and the right to represent his country at ternatonal gatherings. Aides say Mr Kalfu has never been so happy as at the London sum- mit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries, rub- bing shoulders with President Bush and President Gorbachev. The public has accepted this arrangement without too much grumbling, not least because it has coincided with a time of great disarray in the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, which failed to capitalise on the LDP's Recruit-related troubles. What- ever his shortcomings inside the LDP, Mr Kaifu has per- formed ably in public - deliv- ering speeches and meeting presidents with suitable aplomb. The LDP's standing in the opinion polls has rarely been higher. However, Mr Takeshita's rivals at the top of the LDP have had enough of the play- acting prime minister. The other faction-heads are angry that Mr Takeshita has, by keeping Mr Kaifu in office, broken the tradition that the prime minister should always be a faction head. For two years these senior poticians have kept quiet because they, like Mr Takes- ita, were tainted by the Recruit affair. They received money or stocks from Recruit, a publish-- ing company which tried to win favour in political circles. But now these men believ- two years out of office is pun- ishment enough. The most anxious among them is Mr Mlyazawa, the former finance minister, who at the age of 71 thinks this may be his last chance to run for the top post. On Friday he became the frast MP to declare his candidacy. Mr Miyazawa, who speaks English, is liked by many for- eigners. But some of his fellow MPs despise him. \"He may speak English,\" says one \"But can he speak Japanese?\" Mir Mitsuzuka, who is 64, is trying to rally a faction which he inherited only earlier this year following the death of Mr Shintaro Abe. He wants a quick success to prevent the faction splitting. But he is dogged by reports of alleged infringements of political fund- raising laws - and therefore, according to some MPs, is not the best man to take office at a time of financial scandals. Another potential candidate among the faction heads is Mr Watanabe, a straight-talking man who once said that if peo- plie wanted clean politicians they should elect Buddhist monks. He is popular among MPs but at a serious disadvan- tage compared with both Mr Mitsuzuka and Mr Miyazawa because his faction is smaller. Some MPs suggest that if Mr Takeshita insists on support- ing Mr Kaifu for a second term, then Mr Miyazawa, Mr Mitsu- zuka and Mr Watanabe will gang up against him. Together they have suficient votes. But they are unlikely to bury their own rivalries for long enough. Mr Takeshita has yet to show his hand. For the moment he is sit- ting tight waiting to see how his potential rivals move. The present arrangements have worked so well that he would like to keep Mr Kaifu where he is. If necessary he can buy off other factions with promises of cabinet seats. But he is conscious of the other faction heads' ambitions. He knows that within his own faction there are younger poli- ticians who would like to be prime minister one day -in- cluding Mr Ryutaro Hashi- moto, the finance minister, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, former party secretary general. There is also the complicating presence of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the sac- tion's nominal head and a mas- ter of intra-party politicking, who sometimes supports Mr Takeshita and at other times comes close to knifing him in the back, for example by encouraging a rivalry between Mr Hashimoto and Mr Ozawa. But Mr Takeshita is still far from declaring himself. The public still resents his role in the Recruit affair and is suspi- cious about apparent links between a Takeshita relative and Mr Ho Yong-Chung, a cen- tral figure in another recent scandal involving Itoman, an Osaka trading company. Perhaps even more impor- tant, Mr Takeshita will never forget the example of his politi- cal mentor, Mr Kakuei Tanaka. Mr Tanaka was prime minister for just two years in 1972-74 before he had to resign over a financial scandal; but he remained the most powerful politician in Japan for the fol- lowing 10 years.",

   "text_content" : "JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is to launch a study of Japanese busine behaviour, including the sys tem of corporate cross shareholdings, which US off :ials have claimed to be a source of exclusive practices Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. Washington and Tokyo have been unable to agree on the business impact of the corpo- rate families, known as keir- etsu. These are characteried by strategic cross-sharehold- ings and are accused by the US of keeping transactions within the family, making the Japa- nse market hard to pnetrate. The US has wanted Tokyo to admit that the very nature of the keirtsu relationship leads to exclusion of \"outsiders\", both Japanese and foreign, but Japanese officials argue that the close corporate links encourage \"economic stabil- ity\" and are not necessarily a source of far practices. An FTC official said the study was likely to begin by neat Mrch, and could look at nldustries such as cars and car parts, a source of friction wit Washington, as well as th- paper product and glss Inds- tris, which have drawn com- plaints from US companies try- ing to enter the market. Japanese officials have examined other industries - including electronics, ship- buildinlg and gas - but W-h- ington says the research was inadequate and did not address issues raised in the bilnte Structural Impedi- ments Initiative talks, meant to trim the trade imbalance. US officials have wanted closer study of the car indus- try, as US car parts companies say cross-holdings amon Ja anese car makers and supp ers ensure foreign comletitors are denied access to the mar- ket, regardless of the quality of their products. The commission said yester- day, \"the keiretsu structure itself does not violate the anti- monopoly law\", and \"only In a case where that shareholding causes repeated violations of the law would we take action\". Officials said companies would be told to sell a cross- shareholding only if there were no other way \"to end a case of repeated violations\". FTC researchers will also study the impact of a core keir- etsu company sending execu- tives to its most important suppliers or to other members of the corporate family. The US has sought increased dis- closure of information to ordi- nary shareholders, the appointment of independent directors, and tougher anti- monopoly laws. In July, the FTC issued new anti-monopoly provisions authorising it to force a com- pany to sell a shareholding, if proof existed that the stak- had led to an exclusive busi- ness relationship.

   "text_content" : "By David Housego in New Delhi A SUBSTANTIAL slowdown in the growth rate of the Indian economy is forecast by the Reserve Bank of India (the cen- tral bank) in its annual report published yesterday. The bank foresees growth in real gross domestic product dropping in the current sinan- cial year to 3 per cent from a trend rate in recent years of 5 per cent. The fall is the result of the recent deflationary mea- sures taken to curb fiscal and balance of payments deficits. The bank warns, however, of a further possible rise in inter- est rates to contain inflation. It says that \"the stance of mone- tary policy cannot but be one of continuing and perhaps increased tightness\". Figures released over the weekend showed that the wholesale price index in August was 15.2 per cent above the level of a year ago - show- ing the inflation rate has more than doubled in 12 months. The central bank forecasts that industrial growth will fall to 6 per cent from 8.4 per cent in 1990-91 and that agricultural output will rise by 1 per cent. Some industrialists believe the annual industrial growth rate will fall to 4 per cent. It foresees the government's stabilisation measures reduc- ing the current account deficit from 2 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 1.8 per cent in 1992-93 and to 1.5 per cent by 1994-95. At this level it says that the current account deficit could be financed by normal capital flows, including multilateral and bilateral assistance, \"a rea- sonable level of external com- mercial borrowing\" and for- eign investment."

However, the loan, which will be disbursed in two tranches of Ecu250m and Ecul50Om, amounts to a vote of confidence in the recently reshuffled govern- ment, led by Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozall. The government was appointed by President Chadli Bendjedid last June following rioting by Islamic fundamen- talists which resulted in the postponing of Algeria's first multi-party general elections. Strong opposition to the amount of the loan, indeed to the very idea of EC lending to Algeria, was voiced by Britain and the Netherlands. But Ger- many appears to have accepted that the support it gave last year to a similar EC loan to Hungary meant it had to acknowledge that its Commu- nity Mediterranean partners had a strong case for support for a neighbour in need. Another reason for the smaller than expected figure was the volte face of France which until last July had vocif- erously opposed the loan. Mr Franqois Mitterrand's about-turn at the Luxembourg summit of heads of state two months ago angered his EC partners. A condition of the loan is that it should not be used to repay borrowing from commer- cial banks. The agreement should encourage the banks to step up progress on a $lbn (L590m) loan intended as par- tial refinancing of bank debt.",

Allegations of torture, \"one-man rule\" and corruption made against Mr Garang 10 days ago by three members of the high command reflect widespread resentment in the 40,000 strong rebel army against \"The Chairman's\" rule. Discontent is particularly strong among soldiers from Bhar el Ghazal region, who make up 60 per cent of the SPLA, who are also angry at the dominance in the leader- ship of people from Mr Gar- ang's Upper Nile province. .; But the failure of discontoen to turn into support for the attempted coup against Mr Garang marks a recognition among most SPLA members that no one else has the mili- tary capability to wage war in the snake and malaria infested swamps of southern Sudan. Mr Garang, denying charges he was training children, said In Torit his problem was weap- ons and not manpower and that he had 15,000 trained adults he could not arm. \"Why would I be giving arms to six- vear-olds when I cannot give arms to 30-year-olds who are already trained,\" he said.",

Informal talks between Hanoi and US ol companies have been held In the pest 18 months, and US oil eecurtives are keen to get the embargo lifted as soon a posle. Although Vietnam is a net l exporter, it needs wetern technology to develop oil fields, nuh a the White Tiger Field in the South China Sea. Th Eat-West Centre, which has studied Vietnam's oil potential, reckos the coun- try's flow of rde could rise from its present level of mwisS m~~. a da, to a a- ch ba 8U I lUM tur- ls a day by the early yar of the nt c-nt ery",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington CONGRESS will return from summer recess today with the *Democratic majority in the House and Senate searching for the miagic political formula to dispel President George Bush's dominance of the legis- lativ agenda,, The Democrats will cast h'bim as the president who cares more about tackling problems abroad than at home. Their case will rest on a series of initiatives on education, tax relief for the middle class, health care and extended unemployment benefits. Mr Bush is not immune, however, to challenge on cer- tain foreign policy issues. After events in the Soviet Union, Democrats will renew efforts to impose conditions on his sup- port for most-favoured nation trade benefits for China. Mr Bush also faces criticism from supporters of Israel over his request to Congress to delay approval of $10bn in loan guarantees for settling Soviet Jews in Israel, though he appears to have won over the two key chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees for the 120-day delay. Democrats are flirting with the idea of using money from the defence budget to fund emergency humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union. Others argue that there is now a case for further defence cuts and a reallocation of funds to domes- tic needs. However, the main con- straint on action remains the 1990 budget agreement. A two- thirds majority in House and Senate would be needed to undo its provisions, which cap domestic and military spend- ing. Congressional leaders are reluctant to break the accord with the White House before the elections next year. Also, a projected budget deficit of m48b in the next fiscal year gives neither side much room for new spending. These are the main issues facing Congress when the Sen- ate returns today and the House of Representatives tomorr6w: * Defence: A House-Senate conference is due shortly to discuss the $291bn military authorisation bill. Democrats will challenge coslty items such as the B-2 stealth bomber. - International treaties: The Senate is due to approve the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, but Mr Bush may delay submitting the Start treaty, to cut US and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles. Congress is expected to approve most- favoured nation status for the Soviet Union, as well as some emergency food aid. * Banking: Both chambers need to approve an $80bn bail- out of the savings and loan industry and the banking's deposit insurance fund. The administration faces the harder task of securing approval for its banking reform proposas. * Transport: Mr Bush may find it hard to sustain a veto of the highway bills which pro- vide for more than $125bn in spending over the next five years. However, the House shelved an earlier bill because of opposition to a 5 cents-a-gal- Ion petrol tax. * Campaign finance: Cleaning up campaign fund-raising is a good deal more popular with the public than Congress. Again, differences over propos- als for public funding and cam paign spending limits make action all the more difficult * Education: Democrats would like to expand aid to poor and middle-income college students; Mr Bush wants to push for raising standards in primary and secondary schools, mainly through exhbr- tatioa rather th n money."

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington JUDGE Clarence Thomas, President George Bush's choice to fill the vacant US Supreme Court seat, is set for a grilling over his views on abortion and on affirmative action in favour of minorities. US Senate judi- ciary committee hearings on the nomination will start today. Mr Thomas is a 43-year-old lawyer who was head of the Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission during the Reagan administration and has been on the bench of the US appeals court in Washington for the past 18 months. Civil rights groups, ranging from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to the Leader- ship Conference on Civil Rights, have opposed his appointment. Mr Thomas is a difficult target from this quar- ter, being black. His conservative record, however, has intensified the hostility of many black groups, who feel betrayed thereby. Even black people who sup- port Mr Thomas are irritated by what they see as the mes- sage - implicit in the presi- dent's nomination to succeed Justice Thurgood Marshall, who retired this year as the only black person ever to sit on the Supreme Court - that the Bush administration is trying to fill a black quota. A fiercer assault may come from women's groups worried that his vote on the Supreme Court could spell the end for the Roe v. Wade decision q 197, by whic the court lished in the US the legalW int to an abortion. Mr Thomas' supporters, however, denythat he has ever expressed vies op the subject. His greatest inuence on th court could be his experience of corporate law. Mr David Duesenberg, general'counsel of the Monsanto company, for which Mr Thomas has worked, believes he could nudge tho court into selecting more busl, ness issues for judgment. The nine Supreme Court jus- tices, enjoying life tenure, have wide powers to review and strike down state and federal laws. They have long adopted a broad view of their powers, venturing into areas where pol- iticians had feared to legislate. However, the court's com- plexion has changed - first as a series of Reagan appoint- ments swung it away from its liberal majority of the 1960s and 1970s, then, after the ran- cour that surrounded the hear- ings involving Judge Robert Bork in 1987, towards a blander kind of candidate who can less easily be attacked. Even lawyers who have sup- ported Mr Thomas's qualifica- tions to sit on the Supreme Court feel that he fits this cate- gory, and cannot be claimed as the most towering jurist of his generation.

   "text_content" : "By John Barham in Buenos Air-- ARGENTINA'S ruling Peronist party has won a greater than expected victory in gubernato- rial and mid-term congressio- nal elections. According to early returns yesterday, the party carried 10 of the 12 provinces contested on Sunday, trouncing the oppo- sition Radical party. The voters have thus over- whelmingly endorsed the eco- nomic reform policies of Presi- dent Carlos Menem and his economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo. Mr Menem took care to avoid crowing, saying \"we should respect and congratulate our adversaries\". The president is now expec- ted to begin talks with opposi- tion leaders on an alliance to smooth the way for further reforms. Despite the Peronist vote having exceeded expecta- tions, the government still lacks a majority in the lower house of Congress, where it remains the largest party. The Radicals are expected to press for greater emphasis on social policies. The federal House of Repre- sentatives, where the govern- ment must rely on an alliance with conservative and indepen- dent parties, is becoming increasingly important because Congress holds the key to eco- nomic reforms, such as restructuring the labour mar- ket and regulating privatised industries. The Peronists not only retained the country's most productive and populous prov- ince, Buenos Aires, with about 50 per cent of the votes, but won hard battles for the north- western provinces of TucumAn and Santa F6, where a pop star and a former motor racing driver respectively took the governorships. The opposition Radical party, which had been expec- ted to win in two provinces, retained only the central industrial province of C6rdoba, governed by Mr Eduardo Ange- loz, Radical candidate in 1989 for the presidency. A regional centre-right party was returned in the southern prov- ince of Neuqu6n. The new governor of Buenos Aires, from December, will be Mr Eduardo Duhalde, now vice-president of the republic. Mr Menem has said he would not replace Mr Duhalde in the vice-presidency, in the event of the Peronist winning the gov- ernorship. This is not least because, according to the con- stitution, the chairman of the senate should step into any vice-presidential vacancy. The said senator happens to be Mr Eduardo Menem, the presi- dent's brother. Analysts were surprised by the strong vote in Buenos Aires for an ex-colonel, Mr Aldo Rico, who led two muti- nies against the previous gov- ernment of Mr Rail Alfonsin. Running as an independent, Mr Rico was third with about 8 per cent of the votes, portray- ing himself as a champion of the dispossessed. The Peronists had won in two of the three provinces that voted on August 11, while the Radicals carried the third at stake then. The eight remain- ing provinces will vote on October 27.

The Cuban population of 10m has one of the highest national per capita tobacco consumptions in the world.

Many of Cuba's hundreds of thousands of habitual smokers receive a fixed quota of cigars and cigarettes in their monthly rations, but smokers could buy more in state shops. Under the new system, adult smokers who receive four packets of cigarettes as a monthly ration would be allowed to buy only two more packets a month. The official statement did not say whether the measres- would affect Cuba's exports of tobacco and cigars. Cigarettes and, to a lesser extent, cigars had been in short supply lately on the local market, causing large queues at kiosks. The statement blamed the shortages on a surge in demand for cigarette- and antiquated manufacturing machinery.",

   "text_content" : "By Rlchard Lnppor SUBSIDENCE claims cost insurrs 2277m in the first half of 1991, according to data Iiublished yester- day by the Association of British Insurers. That was move than double the amount paid out in the corre- sponding period of last year. There has been more rainfall this year than in 1989 or 1990 but the water table remains very low, espe- cially in the south-east where clay soils are particularly prone to the shrinkage which leads to subsidence damage. Subsidenbae caims~amounted to Â£155.6m in the first quarter of the year and Â£121.4m in the second quar- ter. Insurers report that claims have levelled off in the past two months, and they do not expect claims to increase as fast as they did in the second half of 1990. Even so, Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the ABI, concedes that last year's payout of Â£500m is likely to be exceeded in 1991 and create a new record for the level of claims on subsidence cover since it was introduced by insurers as a standard feature of household insur- ance policies in the early 1970s. Mr Graham Shearn, corporate planning manager of Sun Alliance UK, the country's biggest insurer of domestic property, sdid he was concerned about the possible effect of two more months of dry weatber, following a dry and sunny August. Rainfall in the south and south east was nearly twice as heavy as average in June and July, but last month amounted to only 27 per cent of average levels, according to the Meteorological Office. In the south east the water table is again approaching the record lows reached in December last year, according to the National Rivers Authority, which reports isolated water shortages in the Thames region. Sun Alliance increased its rates for household insurance last July to provide for the increased risk from subsidence. Rates are to be varied according to zone, with householders in the south-east paying up to 90 per cent more for their policies. Most big insurers have followed suit. But more - including further tightening of building standards - may need to be done. Mr Shearn said that the public's perception of the importance of the problem was often out of proportion to the actual level of structural dam- age caused by subsidence. He added: \"Subsidence has a major effect on the market value of a property.\" * Theft is costing insurers more than Â£2m a day, according to the ABI. Claims increased by 51 per cent in the first half of 1991, reaching a total of Â£453m. Commercial proper- ties have proved particularly vulner- able, with losses at Â£164.8m against Â£109.5m in the first half of 1990. Mr Mike Jones, chief executive of the ABI, said: \"Office equipment - including personal computers, faxes and answering machines - is becoming a particularly popular tar- get for thieves.\" Domestic thefts also rose sharply, from Â£190.2m in the first six months of 1990 to Â£288.6m this year, with smaller urban and rural areas - pre- viously less susceptible to theft - becoming more vulnerable. The number and average cost of theft claims rose more than 20 per cent. Fire claims were down in the first half of 1991 to Â£313m compared with M53m in the corresponding period of 1990, although last year's figure fol- lowed sharp rises in 1988 and 1989. Mr Jones said malicious arson was a significant problem and fraudulent arson was responsible for between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of all arson.",

   "text_content" : "WHEN Europe's Ryder Cup golf team flies to the US later this month it may have to forgo the supersonic pleasures of Con- corde and instead fly at sub- sonic speeds on a more mun- dane Jumbo jet. The team was due to fly on a British Airways Concorde chartered by the Keith Prowse group, which collapsed yester- day. The trip was to be paid for by golf enthusiasts who had paid Â£10,000 a head for the priv- ilege of mixing with stars such as Nick Faldo and Seve Balles- teros. Yesterday Mr Malcolm Shier- son, one of three receivers appointed from accountancy firm Grant Thornton, was not optimistic that the trip would go ahead. \"Some 42 people have paid Â£420,000 in total for the Con- corde trip,\" he said. \"British Airways certainly haven't received the money, so I don't know if it is likely to go ahead or not. That's up to BA.\" About 20,000 other corporate hospitality packages are also in doubt for the Rugby World Cup that starts in the UK next month. Keith Prowse had exclusive rights to provide the executive wining and dining at these matches and had already banked some Â£5m from compa- nies willing to pay, for exam- ple, Â£295 a head for tickets and lunch for the opening England versus New Zealand match. \"It has yet to be established if they will still get their tick- ets and hospitality,\" said Mr Shierson. The group's collapse came as a shock to the cosy world of corporate hospitality where Keith Prowse had been seen as the blue-chip operator in an industry known for its cow- boys. Apart from such prestige events as the Ryder Cup and Rugby World Cup, Keith Prowse was the official corpo- rate-hospitality provider for the Wimbledon tennis champi- onships and Lord's test matches. It disdained to join the industry body, the Corpo- rate Hospitality Association, because other companies did not always have official access to the tickets they were selling. But .Keith Prowse's concen- tration on the top events cre- ated problems this year when the combination of the reces- sion and the effects of the Gulf war forced many companies to abandon plans to woo new business at leading sporting and social gatherings. Mrs Jean Lee, the associa. tion's administrator, said yes- terday: \"It is those top events which have been hit hardest by the recession, more so than small-scale and less expensive Picking up the tab for the recession: a Keith Prowse ticKet agency n London yesterday 1 entertaining such as clay-pi. geon shoots and so on.\" Corpo- rate-hospitality entertaining as a whole is estimated to have declined by 30 per cent this year. Keith Prowse's operations were harder hit by the impact of the Gulf war on interna- tional travel and tourism. Visi- tors to the UK fell 12 per cent in the first half of 1991, com- paied with the first half of 1990. But it was the shortfall of Americans - down by 29 per cent in numbers in the first half - that caused the most difficulty as traditionally they 'ould buy a substantial pro- portion of the Im theatre and other tickets sold through Keith Prowse outlets. In recent years the group's theatre ticket sales had come under pressure from the aboli- tion in 1985 of the restrictive trade agreement between Lon- don ticket agencies and the Society of West End Theatres. Keith Prowse typically oper- ated a 4 per cent charge to bo: offices for selling tickets but imposed a hefty commission of between 22.5 per cent and 2$ per cent to the customer. While ticket agencie# normally settle some two weeks after a show, Keith Prowse's growing cashflo* problems in recent weekP meant that it was paying thea- tres nearer five weeks after a performance. \"It's looking fairly grim,\" admitted Mr Nick Allott, exec- utive producer for Cameron McIntosh (producer of Cats, Miss Saigon and Les Misdra- bles), yesterday. \"We are exposed to several hundreds of thousands of pounds. At the moment we are dealing in damage limitation.\" The receivers have set up a number of telephone help lines for ticketholders.

The arrest of about 30 BCCI officers took investigators, reg- ulators and diplomats in other countries by surprise. - ne action took place with- out the cooperation of authori- ies in other countries which have been investigating events surrounding the BCCI collapse. SThe emirate's authbrities -eleased no jnformation yester- day abmat the whereabouts of thos -detained, or whether they ad been charged. A i.r- ti 'o one of those arrested id hnU Information had been tiivanud no contast had been wed wkth tose ld. UK Foreign Office officials confirmed that the Serious Fraud Office had no role in detaining BCCI executives in Abu Dhabi. They said, how- ever, that the British embassy was seeking access to Britons who had been arrested. Among those understood to have been detained are Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCC's former chief executive, and Mr Zarfa bal, who replaced him last year. Mr lqbal was an Abu D-habi appotment,after Mr aqvi h admitted his purt in ilicit activities at the bank. Neither Mr Naqvi's lawyer in i'shngtuo nor his family in Amb Dhabi appeared to knmo where Mr Naqvi was or to have Mad any contact with him. A am-ly member staying at his ap rtment In the Al Atn Palace Hotel said: \"Just keep praying for everyone.\" It emerged that between 12 and 15 of those detained were UK citizens. Their names were supplied to the British consul- ate in Abu Dhabi, but these were being withheld last night. The UK Foreign Office said that it was taking steps to find out where the British citizens, believed to be of Pakistani ori- gin, were being held and to make sure they were well treated. News of the arrests prompted concern that a restructuring of BCCI now looked less likely. Touche Ross, which is acting as court- appointed administrator of the bank in several jurisdictions, said \"If the people arrested are the people involved in running the bank, obviously it will make it more difficult.\" One source close to the restructurin discussions said \"You couldn't relaunch this in a million years after mass arrests like this.\" The arrests on Sunday, which according to one report were followed up by others yes- terday, marked a sudden rever- sal in the public attitude of the Abu Dhabi authorities. Normally highly secretive, Abu Dhabi took the unsual step on after the BCCI clo- sure in July of placing full- page newspaper advertise- ments attacking the dedsion of foureig regulators to close the bank.

The Midland branch of the Institute of Directors yester- day offered this as one solu- tion to deteriorating relations between high-street banks and their smaller corporate cus- tomers. There were allegations ear- lier this year that the banks were not passing on interest- rate cuts to small-business cli- ents. Concern about relations between banks and small busi- nesses has become acute in the Midlands because of cashflow problems caused by the reces- sion and because of antici- pated demand for more work- ing capital as the economy recovers. The Birmingham Chamber of Industry & Commerce dis- closed yesterday in a survey of business problems that 74 per cent of its respondents had cashflow difficulties while 21.3 per cent faced problems with their banks over credit. More than 55 per cent of the compa- nies polled believed that fund- ing arrangements in other countries gave overseas com- panies an advantage over their UK competitors. Mr John Andrews, the loD's regional chairman, noted that in Germany and Japan \"banks expect to have a long-term relationship, are happy to take equity in a busi- ness and, where appropiate, have a representative on the board\". Mr Tony Bradley, manager of the Birmingham Chamber's home policy department, stressed the need for a con- tinuing relationship between small companies and banks with \"the financial sector sup- porting industry by having longer-term involvement through equity\". Relations between banks and companies should be dis- cussed openly, Mr Andrews said."

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy A BITTER ROW broke out last night between ITV and British Sky Broadcasting over a satel- lite television advertising cam- paign due to be launched on commercial television last night. Some companies including Thames Television, the largest ITV company, threatened to block the advertisements until the ITV marketing committee had a chance to view them. The advertisments, part of a marketing campaign due to run until the first week of December, feature two-second snippets of BSkyB programmes with the slogan: \"Sky: see what you've been missing.\" It is believed that senior ITV executives were unhappy with the word \"missing\" and what they saw as an implication that ITV was not providing a full range of programmes. The issue went before yester- day's council meeting of the ITV Association, the industry's trade body. ITV managing directors decided that the advertisements could run until the end of this week, but they would be banned from next week unless the slogan was changed. BSkyB - in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a significant stake - has also been criticised over the advertisements for its film channels. The claim in the commercials that the satellite channel has 60 \"new\" films is being contested by ITV on the the grounds that films described as new should be less than a year old. Mr David Evans, BSkyB mar- keting director, replied: \"No way,\" when asked last night if his company would change its commercials. He added: \"We will be obliged to take every possible action that we can to market our service in a fair and balanced way.\" It is clear that legal action against the ITV companies have not been ruled out. In the early days of satellite television Mr James Gatward, then chief executive of TVS, the ITV company in the south of England, indicated that he would not carry advertise- ments for a potential rival. The Independent Broadcast- ing Authority ruled that the ITV companies should carry advertisements for satellite television as long as they did not denigrate ITV or ITV pro- grammes. BSkyB is planning to spend about Â£5m on its marketing campaign using television, radio and posters in an attempt to boost the sale of satellite dishes.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack THE GOVERNMENT yester- day unveiled details of two pro- posed qualifications designed to encourage young people to continue in education after the age of 16. Ordinary and Advanced diplomas, designed to bridge the gap between academic and vocational qualifications for those aged 16 to 19, could be issued in England and Wales from September 1994. The Department of Educa- tion and Science circulated a consultation document giving full details of the diplomas, which were mentioned in the government's education and training white paper last May. Mr Tim Eggar, education minister, said the aim was to encourage young people to remain in training, and provide a simple way to compare voca- tional and academic qualifica- tions. Diplomas will be issued in addition to existing A-levels and the National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) that are being developed. The Ordinary Diploma would demonstrate that the student had the basic essential skills for pursuing higher education or moving into work. These would include four GCSEs at least at National Curriculum level 7, including English and Maths; a general NVQ at level 2; or an occupationally specific NVQ combined with basic English and maths skills. There is no requirement for a foreign language or a science. The Advanced Diploma would indicate that the student was suitable for most degree courses or jobs at that level. It would include two A-levels at any grade, or NVQ level 3. * Mr David Hart, general sec- retary of the National Associa- tion of Head Teachers, said efforts to boost education stan- dards were doomed unless the quality of new teachers was improved. He was speaking at a Liberal Democrat meeting in Bournemouth.",

   "text_content" : "AN INITIATIVE to investigate the economics of recycling more of the 5bn cardboard boxes made in the UK each year has been launched by the packaging industry in response to environmental legislation sweeping Europe, John Thornhill writes. The British Fibreboard Pack- aging Association, which repre- sents most of the country's cor- rugated-box manufacturers, said it was essential for the industry to tackle the problem of recycling if it wanted to compete on common ground in the European Community. From December German consumers will be able to return transport packaging on consumer goods to the point of sale, to be collected by the pro- ducer. The association said that British exporters might be at a disadvantage unless a reciprocal scheme operated in the UK. About 60 per cent of trans- port packaging is already recy- cled. The association plans to increase this by taking back more cardboard boxes and returning them to the produc- ers. It is collaborating with trade associations representing the manufacturing and retail- ing sectors and with local authorities. It said: \"We believe that the whole system will be commer- cially funded by the value derived from the returned boxes but, in practice, if there is a residual cost then the packaging industry will acknowledge its reslonsibili- ties.\" BA relaunches Club Europe BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday relaunched Club Europe, its short-haul business-class ser- vice, to meet increased compe- tition from other European air- lines. The relaunch is costing Â£7m and includes a new lounge for business passengers flying from Heathrow's Terminal One. The lounge, available after travellers have gone through passport control, can accommodate up to 400 passen- gers and is the largest in a European airport. Most of BA's efforts are aimed at improving ground facilities, with a new express parking service at Terminal One and the ability to choose seats when reserving a ticket. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, said yesterday that the relaunch was intended to take account of the business traveller's need for flexibility. \"Every year nearly 2m of our Club Europe passengers travel on business at less than a week's notice.\" Tube passengers sent on live track PASSENGERS walked along a live 630-volt stretch of track when they were evacuated from a Tube train during a police chase on July 26, Lon- don Underground said yester- day. It blamed a \"staff commu- nication error\" for the incident, which happened near Leytonstone station on the Central Line in east London. The 34 passengers were evac- uated on the insistence of police, who were pursuing a suspect they believed was armed.

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent THE Conservatives signalled an end to the summer lull in party hostilities yesterday with a fierce onslaught on Labour's defence policy. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, said com- ments by Mr Neil Kinnock on Sunday promising the indefi- nite retention of nuclear weap- ons were at odds with official Labour policy and required clarification. He was backed by Mr Tom King, defence secretary, who argued in a 19-page document - Britain's Defence: Unsafe in Labour's Hands - that the Labour party's annual confer- ence last year had committed it to a cut in expenditure esti- mated at Â£6bn, or 27 per cent of the total budget. By contrast, the govern- ment's cuts represented 6 per cent over four years, the most modest made by a Nato power. He said Labour resolutions to reduce Britain's defence spend- ing to the average of European Community Nato members risked creating \"havoc\" with the armed forces. \"They would undermine our whole commitment to Nato and make it impossible for us ever again to play the role that we did in the Falklands and the Gulf,\" Mr King said. The strategy was a policy not for defence but for \"wholesale uni- lateral disarmament\". Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, retorted that Mr King had him- self publicly wavered over the scale and depth of proposed defence cuts after criticism from backbenchers. He gave an assurance that Labour would make available whatever funds were necessary to honour Britain's Nato and peace-keeping commitments. Tony Andrws Battle plans: Tom King says Labour would create \"havoc\"",

   "text_content" : "By Chri Tlghe BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels is seeking permission to sink test boreholes in the Lake District National Park in preparation for Britain's first radioactive waste dump. The two proposed 1,000 metre holes would be on two upland sites at Bleng Fell and Whin Garth, about four miles from BNFL's Sellafield repro- cessing site in Cumbria. Dril- ling would take 2% years, fol- lowed by four years of tests. BNFL has already sunk bore- holes, with permission from Cumbria County Council, on sites within and just outside Sellafield's perimeter. The boreholes, which were not in the national park, were drilled on behalf of UK Nirex, which in July announced its choice of Sellafield as the preferred site for the Â£2.5bn underground repository for intermediate and low-level waste. BNFL's decision to try to expand exploration into the national park has alarmed con- servationists as well as local people who are uneasy about the industry's expansion. Mr Mike Houston, secretary of the 7,500-member Friends of the Lake District, said the borehole proposal was the most significant move by the nuclear industry in the Lake District since BNFL sought permission for extensive water extraction from Ennerdale and Wast Water in Cumbria. That proposal was rejected in 1980. Mr Houston said his group would press the Lake District Special Planning Board to reject the new applications."

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkin LABOUR will not set a target during the general election of how many jobs it would create, in spite of the party's determi- nation to make unemployment a central issue. Strategists at Labour, which in the last general election year of 1967 said that it would cut unemployment by Im over two years, believe any pledges on a level of job creation in this campaign could back- fire. This time the party will argue that its economic pack- age will create better condi- tions for reducing unemploy- ment over the longer term. It will also seek to build an image of financial prudence and will focus attacks on the government's alleged mishan ling of the economy. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, yester- day intensified Labour's efforts to return the political spotligt to domestic issues, particularly the social and financial cost of unemployment, rather than international events. He published figures show ing that Conservative constitu encies continue' to suffer far steeper rises in unemployment than Labo r-held seats. Of the 200 seats that have seen the fastest rises in unemployment over the past year, 190 were Tory-held. A further big rise in unem- ployment is expected in the figures for August which will be announced on Thurs- day. Labour has proposed an \"emergency programme\" for work and training including 150,000 places on a jobexperi- ence programme. Mr Blair said: \"There is a limit to how much you can implement at any one time, but these programmes are what we believe will be implemented immediately and have a direct and immediate impact pn unemployment.\" Mr Michael Howard, emplo ment secretary, reacted swtly to Labour's campaign yestqr- day. \"Everyone knows that unemployment causes real human difficulties,\" he said. \"The political issue Is which party's policies can most quickly bring unemployment down. Every Labour govern- ment since 1929 has doubled unemployment.\"",

North and Mid-Cheshire Traniing and Enterprise Coun- cil (Tec) has introduced the incentives for both Employ- ment Training (ET), the scheme for unemployed adults, and Youth Training. It is offer- ing employers up to Â£20 a week to take on ET trainees, and between Â£1.50 and Â£6 a week for trainees on YT. Jobs within companies for people on YT and ET have been in short supply because of the recession. Workplaces are an important component of the two training schemes. Several Tecs have recently warned that they may face a shortage of training places with companies for YT train- ees. Sheffield Tec last week launched a city-wide campaign to urge employers to partici pate in YT, in a joint enter- prise with Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Mr Don Lyon, chairman of Sheffield chamber, said: \"In a recession it is quite under standable for employers to be reluctant to invest in training. However, what many of them may not realise is that YT is an excellent way to make that investment and prepare for the future. \"The recession will not go on for ever, and when it ends the companies which have trained, and which have brought young people on to fill skill gaps, are the ones that will be best placed.\" Mr Don Stewart, chief execu tive of the Tec, whose board, like that of all other Tecs, is dominated by business leaders, said: \"In addition tc the straight financial help, the board of the Tec is trying to drum up more training places. \"We have drawn up a list of all those companies which have cut back on their places, and have enlisted the help of the board to encourage their peers in industry to do some- thing about the problem.\""

Marston, a vehicle radiator manifacturer, after the company said it wanted to explore the possibil- ity of reducing the number of unions at its Leeds plant from three to one. The company, threequarters owned by the Japanese com- pany Nippondenso, wants the three unions with representa- tional rights at the plant to consider competing for a single-union deal. The three are the AEU engineering union and the MSS and GMB general unions. Union leaders, including Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general sec- retary, have already rejected the idea, although they say they would consider single- table bargaining arrangements under which all three would negotiate together. w threat- ene dispute At Marston fol- lows condemnation by the Trades Union Congress last week of \"single-union plant agreements which ignore established multi-union arrangements\".

Mr Elfed Lewis, Marston managing director, said yester- day that the company would review all options in talks with the unions expected in the next few weeks. These would include continuing current arrangements, but it was possi ble the company might eventu ally not recognise any union. Marston, which was taker over by Nippondenso two years ago, does not recognise unions at its other plant, in Shipley, West Yorkshire. In March it gave six months' notice to unions at Leeds, where 300 pec pie work, that it wanted to develop a new contract of employment for hourly-paid employees and a new recogni- tion agreement that would redefine the role of unions. Mr Lewis said there had been problems with union; over job demarcations. He said: \"We would prefer single-union status. We want each union to make a representation to tell us what it can do for employ ees and for the company.\" TUC guidelines on inter union disputes would prevent any of the three unions agree ing a deal that excluded the other two."

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff THE HEALTH and Safety Executive yesterday warned offshore oil and gas operators in the North Sea that they must produce safety plans which it judges acceptable by 1995 or they will be barred rom operating.. The timetable was disclosed by the executive in its first announcement of a new frame- work for offshore safety since it took over responsibility for the issue earlier this year from the Department of Energy. The Cullen Report on the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988, in which 167 people died, recom- mended the transfer of respon- sibility to the HSE. It also made more than 100 other recommendations that were accepted in full by the govern- ment. The offshore industry has estimated that about Â£lbn has been spent on safety improve- ments in the wake of Piper Alpha and that further work over the next few years is likely to cost Â£8bn. The HSE's new offshore safety strategy is based on the concept of the \"safety case\" - a system used in the nuclear and chemical industries. Oper- ators will have to produce a detailed document for each of THE Department of Emp- loyment yesterday launched a drive to recruit up to 450 lay members to industrial tribunals. Attempts are being made to ncrease the nub of women and eth- nic-minority representatives. Nominations are being invited from employers' organisations and unions for candidates with industrial relations experience to serve from October 1992. Members are initially appointed for three years and have to be available for up to 15 days a year. Fees are Â£101 for each full day's sitting. Each tribunal consists of a legally qualified chairman and two lay members. nearly 300 North Sea installa- tions setting out hazards, risks and action being taken to ensure workers' safety at all stages of an installation's life. Under the \"safety case\" regu- lations, the HSE will have to accept operators' plans. Docu- ments approved will then form the basis of a system of inspec- tion and audit. The HSE said the plans would not be \"once and for all\" and would have to be amended as circumstances changed. Inspectors will have the power to close an installation if safety procedures are not up to stan- dard. Mr John Rimington, director-general of the HSE, said: \"That is a massive sanc- tion, together with the threat of unlimited fines.\" The executive also said it would review regulations cov- ering workforce safety repre- sentatives. Current rules, which unions oppose, stipulate that the elec- tion of safety representatives must be from the whole work- force. There is no provision for the appointment of union represen- tatives. The issue of safety rep- resentatives was the focus of much of the industrial unrest over union recognition in the North Sea last summer. The new regulations are likely to be in place by the autumn of next year and in force by the late spring of 1993. A further six months will be allowed for the submission of \"safety cases\" for existing installations. An absolute deadline during 1995 will be set beyond which no installation will be allowed to operate without an approved \"safety case\".",

   "text_content" : "HERE is one subject on which public debate has been declared taboo at this week's Liberal Democrat conference. The possibility of an incon- clusive general election - and more importantly how the Lib- eral Democrats would react in the event of a hung parliament - is both a dream and a night- mare for Mr Paddy Ashdown. After an exhaustive analysis of the possibilities and pitfalls, he has decided that the best course is to refuse to comment on them. In a series of meetings at Westminster in the past few months Mr Ashdown and his colleagues have drawn up a detailed strategy to guide the After analysis of the possibilities and pit-. falls he has decided that the best course is to refuse comment on them party's response to the election of a minority government. Their determination to focus this week's conference on poli- cies rather than statistical hypotheses reflects a realisa- tion in those discussions that the reality would be so compli- cated, the permutations so extensive, that it is dangerous even to acknowledge them. The starting point is an edu- cated guess that the Liberal Democrats will enter the cam- paign with their standing in the opinion polls at a point or two above the average of 15 per cent seen in recent polls. The expectation - perhaps hope is a better word - is that during the campaign the figure might rise to about 20 per cent. Allowing for variable regional swings and the loss of some seats cancelling out gains elsewhere, the general expecta- tion is that the party should finish near its present total of 22 MPs. An optimistic view pushes that up to 30 seats. So, for all the talk this week of an imminent Labour col- lapse, no one in Bournemouth really expects the Liberal Dem- ocrats to reach the threshold of 30 per cent of the vote at which they would begin to pick up scores of constituencies. Against that background, the private Judgment of party leaders - it can never be admitted publicly - is that the best outcome would be an out- right Conservative victory. If Mr John Major was returned with a solid majority, the argument runs, the band- wagon in favour of electoral reform in the Labour Party would be unstoppable. After the inevitable blood-letting, the Labour leader who replaced Mr Neil Kinnock would be forced to do a deal with Mr Ashdown embracing a commitment to proportional representation. But Mr Ashdown has to plan against the possibility that neither Mr Major nor Mr Kin- nock secures an outright majority. The Liberal Demo- crats might then hold the bal- ance of power. The prize would be the pre- cious opportunity to exercise real power. The risks would be the same as during the 1970s, when the identity of the then Liberal party was submerged in the unfortunately named Lib-Lab pact. Mr Ashdown's starting point is that it would be a mistake to do any deal which did not include a watertight commit- ment by the majority party to abolish the first-past-the-post system for elections to West- minster. His judgment is also that neither Labour nor the Conser- vatives would be ready to offer that after a first inconclusive election - although the pres- sure on Mr Kinnock would obviously be much greater than on Mr Major. So the Liberal Democrats' hopes of breaking the two-party mould would be pinned on an incon- clusive outcome in a second election. It is at this stage, Mr Ash- down and his colleagues have decided, that things become dangerously complicated. The risk after the first election would be -that the winner would adopt the same tactics as Mr Harold Wilson in 1974, aiming to take advantage of partial victory to win a second poll six or nine months later. If Mr Ashdown forced the pace by voting against the pro- gramme of a minority govern- ment, the Liberal Democrats could be cast as a dangerous minority denying the country stable government. That fear is behind Mr Ashdown's decision to stress that proportional re- resentation would not only offer a fairer voting system but would act as a guarantee of stable government. If he settled for anything less than an ironclad commitment to PR, Mr Ashdown could be The prize would be the opportunity to exercise real power. The risks would be the same as during the 1970s sure any pact would last only as long as it suited the incum- bent in Downing Street. There are other awkward scenarios. There is the possibil- ity that an offer by Mr Kinnock of PR in elections to a new Scottish assembly could split the Liberal Democrats by detaching Scottish MPs from Mr Ashdown's uncompromis- ing stance. There is the real prospect also that many newly elected Liberal Democrat MPs would simply not be prepared to risk their seats in a second election whatever their leader's long-term strategy. For now these are all hypotheses. But as Lord Jen- kins of Hillhead pointed out earlier this week, eight out of 24 general elections this cen- tury have resulted in hung par- liaments. The country is due for another, and it is easy to understand why Mr Ashdown prefers not to discuss the implications. Joe Rogaly, Page 15",

   "text_content" : "Ly David Owj MR CHARLES RKEl EDY, the firmly '.on winnhin the Kincr- dine and Deesidieseat, claiming that victory would make them the second party in Scotland. A Liberal Democrat win would relegate the Conserva- tives to third place in terms of the number of Scottish seats held, Mr Kennedy said. The prospective by-election follows the death of Mr Allck Buchanan-Smith, the Conser- vative who had held the seat since 1983. In a rumbustious speech dur- ing which he lambasted Con- servative and Labour notables with equal and obvious relish, the party president portrayed the Liberal Democrats as the lone radical party \"ranged against two competing sets of conservative values\". \"On offer is Thatcherism as ameliorated by Mr Major or Thatcherism as ameliorated by Mr Kinnock,\" he said. He also sought to reverse the old argument about a vote for the centre party being a wasted vote, claiming that \"Labour cannot win the next election and they know it... A Labour vote is a wasted vote.\" On Kincardine, Mr Kennedy described it as ironic that the former constituency of an MP who left the Conservative front bench over the party's U-turn on devolution should become the battleground for a by-elec- tion \"the implications of which will stretch far beyond its boundaries\". A Liberal Democrat win would give the party 10 MPs north of the border, compared with nine for the Tories. Mr Buchanan-Smith's major- ity in 1987 was just over 2,000 compared with nearly 8,000 in 1983. The Liberal Democrat candidate will again be Mr Nicol Stephen, a solicitor. While Mr Kennedy was given a standing ovation, some misgivings were expressed out- side the hall that publicly set- ting the party's expectations so high even before any campaign began might be a tactical error. Mr Kennedy branded the Cit- izen's Charter \"a consumers' charter\", saying: \"Mr Major offers redress when things go wrong; we say they shouldn't go wrong because citizens should be offered rights first, rot just redress alerwards.\" Pointing the way: Charles Kennedy said a vote for Labour would prove a wasted vote He criticised Mr Major and Mr Kinnock for disavowing their respective political pasts. \"The two statements I guaran- tee you will not hear... in the next election are Mr Major say ing 'I was a Thatcherite; I am a Thatcherite' and Mr Kinnock saying 'I was a socialist; I am a socialist.'\" SMr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey, called last night for the dises- tablishment of the Church of England and reform of the monarchy. He told a fringe meeting that such moves should be included in the party's plans for constitutional reform. \"If we believe constitutional reform is fundamental to all the liberating developments in our society, not to include the Church of England and the monarchy seems to me to be anomalous,\" he said. The party is proposing a complete reform of local and national government.",

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith NURSERY SCHOOLS, oppor- tunities for 16-to-19-year-olds and adult education were tar- geted yesterday for the extra investment of almost Â£2bn the party is committed to make to education, even if it means raising income tax. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, told a rally a Lib- eral Democrat government would spend an extra 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, or Â£1.9bn, on education in its first year. The party has already taken the distinctive stance of saying explicitly that it would be pre- pared to raise the basic rate of tax by Ip in the pound if that proved necessary to finance greater spending. Supported by Mrs Shirley Williams, one of the party's senior figures, and by Mr Mat- thew Taylor, parliamentary education spokesman, Mr Ash- down said that Tory education policies were based on three gimmicks: standard assess- ment tasks, allowing schools to opt out of council control and the Citizen's Charter proposals that schools would have to publish their exam results and could choose their own inspec- tors. Mrs Williams later called for a new consensus between teachers, employers and others to tackle education's problems. Putting a fresh gloss on Mr John Major's references to his own experience of having left school with few qualifications, Mr Ashdown said that the prime minister was wrong to conclude that since he was able to break free, the educa- tion system must be right. He spelt out three specific policies to which the party was committed: the right to one year's pre-school education for every child; two days training every week for each 16-to-19- year-olds in work, together with a remissible training tax; and an entitlement to a further period of training or education, available to every adult. Mr Ashdown's words about respecting and encouraging diversity of education provi- sion are likely to be seized on by the Tories. The party says it would bring all schools back under local authority control, though in a looser form than now exists. He attacked Labour's spend- ing plans for being vague, and for talking about \"priorities\" when in reality that would not amount to extra investment in the first five years. The party is conscious that it is seen as having taken a high risk in saying it might increase taxes, even with the \"if neces- sary\" caveat. It believes, how- ever, that it will benefit, espe- cially once it is specific about the size, timing and location of spending.",

   "text_content" : "By Alson Smith THE AIM of European sovereignty and the concept of European citizenship were overwhelmingly accepted by the party yesterday, as it reinforced its commitment to a federal Europe. Sir Russell Johnston, Euro- pean affairs spokesman, told delegates the pace of recent events meant that the time- table for economic and politi- cal union was no longer under the control of EC leaders. \"A tide of chaos is lapping at our walls: to turn back that tide and ensure that prosperity follows freedom through the east, then the community must unite.\" Later, Lord Jenkins of Hil- lhead, the party's leader in the Lords and a former EC com- missioner, rejected as \"one of the greatest fallacies\" the idea that strengthening links among existing EC members was diametrically opposed to widening it to include the emerging eastern European democracies. He said that the EC's system would have to change to cope with a community that might have 20 or more members, when aspects such as the indi- vidual national veto would be an \"absolute nonsense\". The party's policy was critic- ised by some speakers for not being radical enough and for merely \"tinkering\" with the present system of EC institu- tions instead of concentrating on fundamental reforms. Sir Russell insisted, however, that it was offering \"a great stride forward and a practical way forward\". Running through the debate was a strong vein of anger that because of the first- past-the-post system used for UK elections to the European parliament, the Liberal Democrats had no MEPs. There was a warning that if the party was unable to win change on this issue it might go to the UK and European courts to achieve proportional representation.",

   "text_content" : "Charles Batchelor on the importance of finding the right insurance cover Secky Truman spent six Smonths attempting to find an S insurance company willing to provide cover for her busi- ness. Most people starting up are able to arrange insurance in a matter of days by phoning their broker or a few insurance companies: but then most people are not in the business of pro viding high-wire acts: Skinning the Cat is a three-year old Bradford company which provides \"aerial theatre\" for arts festivals and similar events. During the four-month summer season it employs four per- formers and three back-up staff. Truman finally managed to arrange insurance through Stafford Knight, a Colchester-based broker which runs a special scheme to help small busi- nesses which have problems finding insurance cover. The scheme was devised jointly with Business in the Community, umbrella organisation for the enterprise agencies, and the insurance is placed with Lloyd's of London. At Â£2,000 a year, insurance premi- ums represent one of Skinning the Cat's biggest expenses but the policy provides cover if the performers injure themselves or a member of the public, theft cover for the props, and motor cover for the act's van. Public liability insurance was essential if Skinning the Cat was to get bookings from the best venues, Truman explains. However, the only claim she has made in three years was under the theft policy following a break-in and the disappearance of some of the group's equipment. Skinning the Cat had particular dif- ficulties obtaining insurance cover because of the unusual nature of its activities but finding adequate, afford- able insurance is a problem facing many small firms. Fierce competition between the insurers in recent years has exerted some pressure to keep rates down but a rising level of claims and poor results from many of the big insurers suggest this is soon likely to change. Figures published by the Associa- tion of British Insurers today showed a 23 per cent rise in the number of claims under commercial theft poli- cies in the first half of 1991 and a 50 per cent leap to Â£165m in the amounts paid out by insurers. \"Premiums need to go up,\" says David Went, of the Norwich Union's commercial marketing department. \"And minimum premiums may need to go up disproportionately.\" The problem for the insurers is that writing policies on small companies is relatively more costly and time-pon- suming than dealing with large com- panies. \"Small businesses which pay Â£100-Â£150 in premiums do not make much money for the insurer,\" says Went. The response of the insurance com- panies has been to devise standar- dised insurance packages from which small commercial customers can choose the options which suit them. Legal & General Insurance (L&G), for example, has a combined business policy offering 13 options including theft, interruption of business and employer's liability. Legal expenses and computer equipment cover have recently been added to the options. Norwich Union, meanwhile, is cur- rently researching a small business package which it hopes will offer flex- ibility to customers with a minimum of administration for the company. Lloyds Bank offers a retailers' protec- tion programme and a trades and ser- vices insurance programme designed for two particular segments of the small business market. The need for insurance cover has become more acute in recent years due to the proliferation of health and safety legislation covering areas such as noise at work, asbestos and danger- ous substances. As employees and their trades unions become more aware of their rights at work they are more likely to press claims against employers. The insurance companies, too, have been adept at identifying new types of insurable risk. \"Key man\" insurance allows a business to insure against the loss of a key manager while busi- ness continuity or partnership insur- ance provides the funds to allows a business to buy out the spouse of a partner or director should a key player die. Meanwhile the tougher attitude being taken by the tax man has prompted the creation of policies which cover businesses against the accountancy and legal costs of a tax investigation. But while developments like these are pushing small businesses to extend their insurance cover, the recession has put pressure on com- pany finances and reduced their abil- ity to pay the premiums. \"The recession is making it very difficult for small businesses,\" com- ments Fay Goodman, Midlands repre- sentative of the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Busi- nesses. \"They have to weigh up whether to take out insurance. If a company takes the risk and then gets hit by a burglary or a fire it may go out of business.\" Companies are also tempted to cut back in areas such as fire prevention, reducing, for example, the frequency with which they clear away waste products. Meanwhile the growth in the number of empty shop premises increases the risks of break-in and fire for neighbouring shops. And while the insurance companies clearly have an interest in providing an attractive service to their custom- ers there are some in the small busi- ness community who question their ability to deal with this section of the market. Like the banks, many insur- ance companies are very large organi- sations and they do not always under- stand the needs of their small business customers, says Stan Men- dham, director general of the Forum of Private Business. A frequent complaint is that the insurer insists on the small firm tak- ing security precautions that are well beyond its means to pay. Christine McDonald Craig, the owner of Circa Antiques of Guard Bridge, Fife, says her insurance company insisted she installed an alarm system when she moved to new premises. \"I had already spent a lot of money on relocating and had installed locks and wire mesh. But the minute the surveyor walked in I could see he had \"burglar alarm\" tattooed on his fore- head. They were not prepared to nego- tiate or give me time to settle in. I detest big companies snapping their fingers and expecting their small cus- tomers to jump.\" In the end McDonald Craig paid Â£350, more than she felt she could afford, for an alarm. She intends looking for a new insurer when the policy comes up for renewal. The big insurers counter that their customers must take precautions to prevent claims levels rising even higher. \"Insurance is not intended to be a substitute for sensible practices,\" comments David Meur, commercial insurances manager at L&G. So how should a company set about getting insurance? Much of the hard work of choosing a company and a policy can be taken away by using a broker. Go to more than one broker to make sure you are getting the widest range of quotes, some experts advise. \"If you go directly to an insurance company or a bank, you may be deal- ing with a clerk who just sends out a proposal form,\" says Peter Norton, a director of brokers Stafford Knight. \"We would talk a customer through a policy.\" But even if you are using a broker Insurance provides a safety net for Skinning the Cat performers you must decide on the type of policy you want. Padticular points to watch out for are t e amount of any claim you will be pected to pay yourself (the excess) nd any restrictions on the policy. \"f the policy says you must install five-lever locks on all your doors, n ake sure you do or you will find the isurer refusing to meet your claim,\" says Peter Thompson, managing d rector of Mercantile Insurance Brbkers (North West) of Preston. One South ondon builder did not realise that ired equipment was excluded from his policy until thieves stole some hired scaffolding he was using and his insurer refused to pay. A Brighton art gallery owner was shocked to disover his policy did not cover thefts from his premises while they were open. Break-ins were cov- ered but he hap to bear the loss when someone walked out with two paint- ings during opening hours. Small business owners often take a unduly narrow view of what needs to be coveredl \"They will take out insurance for Â£200 worth of tools, which they coold replace themselves, but fail to consider the need for public liability insurance,\" says Norton. Les Sheppard, founder of a chain of three Midlands DIY shops, was glad that he had taken out public liability cover, when a customer was injured by a pile of boards dislodged by another customer. Sheppard's insur- ance company met the claim for Â£16,000 which would have otherwise made a big dent in the company's profits. The final choice of an insurance policy should depend on a combina- tion of three factors; price, cover and ease of obtaining payment, the experts advise. A cheap policy which provides inadequate cover could prove a liability. An attractive policy from a company which disputes or delays payment - and even some of the big name companies can prove difficult here - is also not to be rec- ommended.

   "text_content" : "By Charles Batchelor Most businesses regard the annual audit as an unpleasant chore. Many firms of accountants dis- like the audit too because it appears to place them in the role of official snoops and spoils what they believe should be a more positive relationship with their clients. .Several ways to reduce the burden, and the cost, of an audit are suggested by accoun- tants Blick Rothenberg: * Before the audit starts check that your accounting records are up to date. * Make an accounts and audit timetable. Sort out in advance where hold-ups are likely to occur and see that staff and data are available when needed. Warn your auditor where problems might occur. * Have all the necessary doc- uments ready. Do not waste time running to the bank for statements or rummaging through files for title deeds or contracts during audit time. * Decide at what stage to pass accounts to the auditors. The more prepared the accounts are, up to draft stage if possi- ble, the sooner the auditor can finalise them. * Agree with the auditor on the format of any schedules and analyses he requires. These can then be prepared by your own staff, saving on audi- tor's fees. * Do not revise the draft accounts every time a potential adjustment arises. Save any adjustments until the final stages of the audit when you can consider their overall effect with the auditor and decide whether they are mate- rial enough to warrant revising the accounts. * Give the auditor somewhere suitable to work. He will require a good working sur- face, proximity to financial records, access to a telephone and secure storage for files. * When the audit is finished, discuss immediately any prob- lems to avoid repetition next year. Review the audit gener- ally for possible improvements. * Between audits review your internal controls. If the auditor can rely on them it will save you time and money. * Review your accounting geography. Is all accountancy information processed in one place or is it dispersed? Doing it in one place is cheaper. * Can you do without subsid- iary companies which each require their own set of accounts? If you can restruc- ture your company into several divisions under one umbrella you will have only one set of statutory accounts to prepare. These suggestions are not aimed at doing your auditor out of a job, Blick Rothenberg says. Clients sometimes find it difficult to believe that clear- ing up their unsatisfactory accounting records can form a significant part of the auditor's final charge and are unwilling to pay for it. It is expensive to use your auditors to replace book-keeping and clerical staff. How to Reduce Your Auditing Costs. Blick Rothenberg, 12 York Gate, London NW1 4QS. Free. Fax 071 935 6852.",

   "article_dc_title" : "A Shift in Balance",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "In the fourth article of a series looking at public spending on research and development throughout the world, Clive Cookson examines the fundamental shift from public to private spending in the UK during the Thatcher years T he \"privatisation\" of research and development in the UK - the shift from public to private funding - over the past decade of the Thatcher era, is causing profound changes in the way the country carries out R&D. The proportion of national expendi- ture on R&D financed by the govern- ment fell from 50 per cent in 1983 to 36.5 per cent in 1989, according to official statistics. Total government spending on civil R&D fell in real terms (1989 prices) from Â£2.81bn in 1981-82 to Â£2.67bn in 1989-90 and a projected Â£2.32bn in 93-94. Defence R&D also is declining, from Â£2.44bn in 1981-82 to Â£2.15bn in 199-90 and a projected Â£2.04bn in 1993-94. The overall figures show that extra funds from industry, charities and other private sources are making up for the declining government support for R&D. But the \"privatisation\" of research is having very uneven effects across the scientific disci- plines. In broad terms, it is shifting the balance of Britain's research effort from the physical sciences to the biomedical area. There are two main reasons for this: * Within industry, UK chemical and pharmaceutical companies are increasing R&D rapidly, while other sectors are barely maintaining their effort. A survey published by the Cen- tral Statistical Office this summer showed that the chemical industry (including pharmaceuticals) increased spending by 45 per cent in real terms between 1985 and 1989. The remainder of manufacturing industry (electronics, aerospace, engineering and motor vehicles) managed only 3 per deWnt'.gr6Owu'L Sn fm aedical chalties very fEat Their total vinu rw O c-q 49mjin g19s/9 to a proec' - in 1:- oMftdi same * thve government' Medical Researc Coudei rtsearchrbe in the pdis\"c scley ince h equivaletint urce of private hd to make up for ht -queeze o the ncase oand ngin ing Rieerch Counilv (Sete). \"Although there is ase andustrl support ivateppbene phyactso do ton hRve the it level iof nosh rvern mental s npport for the pbydical si ences as di biomedical v sclenche enjoy in '1l UK,\" ay Martin Rees, director of tipe Intitaute f AmnonDmy at Cambridge uiversit. \"I C tham e u owever, the re is a tradition of private benefactions for mstron soumy.

These contributions are determined by inter- national treaties and have to be for paid in Swiss fiance. As a result, Ser announced this year that it would have to lose theUK Nuclear Struc- ture Farcilty at Daresbury, Cheshire, in 1992-93 - a decision that has pro- voked an international outcry among physicists. Scientists want the government to pay separately for Cemrn and Esa, as other European countries do, and remove their subscriptions from the basic science budget Rees points out that space-based astronomy generally gives much less value for money than ground-based astronomy; a US study found that dim spent on the ground gives a much scientific value as $1om devoted to space research. The gov- Ernment should recognise that space science commands a premium price - justified for strategic and industrial reasons - and finance it accordingly, he says. The concerns of academics are ech- oed in industry. \"We are unhappy about a funding structure which effec- tively appears to leaveordinary chem- istry research as a tail-end Charlie in the queue for funding, after the appe- tites of the big prestige projects have been fed, whether in pounds sterling or, even more problematic, in Swiss francs,\" says David Culpin, business development director of.the Chemical Industries Association. Another serious concern, in acade- mia and in industry, is.that cuts in government funding are pushing uni- versity scientists into short-term g0oIJ~ I~apkl~ 'SOCE,~k; research projects with largely predic- able outcomes. \"Today's financial pressures upon academic researchers, which are forc ing them to concentrate their research upon areas of already defined commercial significance, cause us mounting concern,\" says Culpin. \"We are strongly of the view that it is in the national interest and Indeed the longer-term interest of the chemical industry, to preserve a healthy degree of academic freedom to pursue research which looks intrin sically interesting. An excessive bias towards exploitability pushes aca- demic research too much towards industry's role and runs the risk for stfling genuinely new and creative approaches.\" David Graham-Smith, professor of clinical pharmacology at Oxford uni- versity, agrees: \"When money is tight, research councils only fund the very safe, short-term bets. The scientific establishment will not sup port the unorthodox idea or risky research.\" One particularly damaging change in the framework for research is the increasing proportion of scientists working on short-term (often three year) contracts. According to the Royal Society, Britain's senior scien tific body, \"1,200 permanent science and engineering posts in universities have been lost since 1979, while the proportion of science and technol- ogy staff on short-term contract posts has risen from 25 per cent to 42 per cent.\" The decline in secure long-term funding is emerging from the Royal Society's current enquiry into the health of UK science as perhaps the nost serious issue of all. University scientists say they have to spend an inordinate amount of time scrabling around for short-term funding *hich reduces their efficiency as researchers. At the same time, the lack of long-term career prospects is damaging the morale and motivation of young scientists. Government critics say that dam- age to Britain's science base is begin- ning to show up in various measures of the country's scientific output. \"On the number of patents regis- tered, the UK position has declined from being second only to Germany in 1983 to being bottom of the league able in 1988,\" says the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Special ists (IPMS), a researchers' trade union, in a report coparing member- countries of the Organisaton for Eco- nomic Co-operation nd Development (OECD). \"On citations of published esearch, UK science is performing worse than it did at the start of the 980s, while the other six leading ndustrial nations are doing much better.\" Meanwhile the government denies hat British scientists face any more problems than those overseas. Alan Howarth, the minister responsible for science, told the British Association for the Advancement of Science last month that UK government spending on civil R&D amounts to 0.52 per cent of gross domestic product, \"a very respectable proportion by interna- ional standards\". \"The very success of science and scientists has meant that we have ong passed the point where it is feasi- ble to support all good work. As a politician I am bound to point out that it is necessary to address difficult questions about priorities,\" Howarth said. \"There are no countries in the world, not even the US and Japan, where this kind of prioritisation, pain ul as it is, can be avoided.\" The Labour party, however, is con- nitted to increasing total UK expendi ture on civil R&D from 1.8 per cent of GDP today to 2.5 per cent (though it gives no timetable for doing so). Labour's policy statement on science, ssued in July, points out that Japan and Germany already devote 2.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent of GDP respec tively to civil R&D. A Labour government would push up direct public spending on research, and at the same time give companies n incentive to do more by introduc- ng a 25 per cent tax credit for additional sums spent on R&D expen- diture over the level in a base year The US government already operates a similar R&D tax incentive scheme. Some scientists have given the Labour proposals a cautious welcome but there is no sign of a scientific stampede to join the party. John Shar pey-Schafer, professor of nuclear physics at Liverpool university, xpressed the common doubt: \"The abour party say they would love to epair British science but I don't hink they will have the money to do it.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Skapinker eeking out the British contribution to Berlin's vast biennial consumer electronics fair is a depssing experience. mstrad, a UK company which makes many of its prod- ucts in the Far East, had a modest stall. There were, no doubt, a few other British com- panies among the hundreds of exhibitors. But there was noth- ing to match the exuberant, gadget-packed halls of the Dutch, Finns, French, Germans and Japanese. On the last Saturday in August, it was almost impossi- ble to move through the crush of Berliners who had come to gawk at the walls of television screens. The ordinary citizen's interest in home electronics seems impressive until one remembers that this is the first Berlin fair since the unification of Germany last October and that there are people for whom these consumer goods are still a novelty. At which point, the whole event becomes depressing. There are wide-screen televi- sions, high definition televi- sions, televisions which allow you to watch one channel alongside miniature versions of the channels you are not watching. The problem is not the television sets. It's what's on them. They show second-rate mov- ies, small talk masquerading as discussion programmes and pop videos. As a company rep- resentative demonstrates a remote-control handset, a semi- naked female form writhes on the screen behind him. One must tread carefully. Many of those packing the exhibition have endured decades under the heel of those who thought they knew what was good for them. If newly-lib- erated Europe wants the tat beamed from satellites and many terrestrial transmitters, then so be it. But there must be something better than this. At one stand a pop group is playing, its image projected onto yet another bank of screens. The playing is appall- ing, but the tune sounds vaguely familiar. It is 'I Want To Hold Your Hand', followed by a medley of assaults on other Beatles' tunes. The British might have dis- appeared from the ranks of TECHNICALLY SPEAKING equipment manufacturers, but their presence is evident else- where. When Philips of the Netherlands presents its new digital cassettes, its display is dominated by blown-up models of the new Dire Straits album. It is impossible to look at television anywhere on the continent without being struck by the comparative quality of the British offering. Is this Britain's future in consumer electronics - to pro- vide the programmes and the music? If so, it is not a bad one. One senior European electron- ics executive confides that making TV sets is a mug's game. Labour costs are high, margins are thin and the com- petition is horrendous. A British concentration on consumer electronics 'soft- ware' is not the familiar tale of exchanging manufacturing for services. Much of the manufac- turing takes place in the UK too. The competition European manufacturers worry about comes from the Japanese, who make their sets in Britain. There are those who will scorn the notion that the UK's TV and musical talents could give it a central role in Euro- pean consumer electronics. The dogged search for the cloud in every silver lining is as British as the Beatles. Sceptics could point out that the Japanese will eventually acquire the remaining British music labels; that the UK gov- ernment's auction of indepen- dent television franchises will do lasting damage to the TV industry; and that the BBC's future is far from secure. These objections might be true, but native television and musical talent is unlikely to disappear. As the Berlin band's strangled efforts demonstrate, there are some things that are not easily imitated."

   "text_content" : "ROYAL FESTIVAL HALL For the last performance in \"Mozart Now\" on Sunday the two groups that have domi- nated the fortnight's music- making, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the Orchestra of the 18th Century, joined forces to re-create a per- formance given in the Vienna Burghtheater in April 1791. The benefit concert that Antonio Salieri conducted eight months before Mozart's death involved an orchestra of over 100 musicians, and the programme is known to have included \"A grand symphony composed by Mr Mozart\", quite probably the G minor K.550. So this celebration ended with a massive performance of that symphony, conducted by Frans Brtiggen. The platform was overflowing with massed violins, quadruple wind, and eight double basses arrayed in a single, dramatic line across the back of the stage. String textures were dense, intri- cately detailed yet, because everything was carefully pro- portioned, never clotted; the brass was imposing without becoming domineering. Forces were halved for the slow move- ment, unfolded by Briggen with straightforward clarity, and then brought back to full strength for fierce, urgent accounts of the minuet and finale. Briggen appears to have relaxed his rigorous ideas on repeats. Where he used to observe even the second-half repeats in Mozart's finales, to the detriment, it often seemed, of the development sections, on this occasion he allowed the G minor's explosive chromati- cisms to make their impact just once. The symphony was tauter as a result, and unfail- ingly dramatic. The C major Symphony K.338 had received similar big- band treatment, and brought a virtuoso display of period artic- ulation and phrasing from the strings; the buzzing bass lines that propelled the finale had a clarity a modern orchestra could never have matched. Briiggen managed a very artful balancing act, giving the exhil- arating impression of a perfor- mance flying by the seat of its pants, while every element in the scheme was slotted into place with total assurance. The filling in this symphonic sandwich was less satisfying. With a such a superfluity of musicians it might have seemed a good idea in theory to air the Notturno for four orchestras K.286, written in Salzburg in 1777, but it really is Mozart going unconvincingly through the motions, while Arleen Auger seemed uncom- sortable in the concert aria \"Misera! dove son\" K.369, if more convincing in the Count- ess's arias from Figaro. Another symphony, though, would have been far more wel- come. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "'The Chariot', 1991, a bronze by Arman indeed unremarked demise of the Paris Biennale in the mid 1980s says much of the present standing of France and her art- ists in the world of interna- tional contemporary art. On the other hand it is not quite the nature of the French to acquiesce meekly in such a state of affairs. The reinstate- ment of a biennale of contem- porary art in France, under the generous auspices of the Minis- tries of Culture and Foreign Affairs and the regional and civic authorities comes there- fore as no surprise. What is perhaps surprising, and quite as welcome in its devolution- ary example, is that this fresh enterprise should be set for once well away from Paris. Lyon, second city of France, is to be the home of this revived Biennale at least for its first three occasions. Its inau- gural curators, Thierry Prat and Thierry Raspail, colleagues at the Musee de l'Art Contem- porain at Lyon, are also con- tracted to oversee its two immediate successors. We can hardly expect their plans to be well advanced as yet, but it is clear that, like the first, they will be chosen along particular themes or principles, rather than follow the pattern of the more open participatory free-for-all. That said, each will be different, one perhaps tak- ing an international overview, the next taking its cue from the century's approaching end to examine those aspects of modernism that still give the face of 20th century art its character. By the mid 1990s, therefore, we should know well enough whether these Lyon Biennales are to stick as major European events, or not. As to that par- ticular prognosis, however, the runes cast last week, with the opening of the first of them (until October 13), rest ambigu- ous. L'amour de I'art is its title, and its particular subject, \"an exhibition of contemporary art in France\", is admission enough that any address to the international currency of mod- ernism can wait. It is as though our own Arts Council's quadrennial British Art Show, or any Summer Show at the Royal Academy for that matter, should arro- gate to itself a larger interna- tional significance simply for being the national creature it is - nice try, but some hope. Only the French, we feel, would expect to get away with it. The irony is that this first of the Lyon Biennales proves to be especially useful, at least to the foreign observer, precisely because it is so parochially constrained. My colleague of le Figaro, calling for an open European biennale of the young, railed against the nar- rowness and, to him, pointless ness of the choice but, for me, here at last was an opportunity to consider a substantial irnche of French art, which treat we have been denied for a generation past. \"Does one believe this the way\", thun- dered M.le Figaro, \"to persuade foreigners to cast a favourable eye over the French scene?\" Well, perhaps not, but at least we can see that there is still a French scene there. We must confb'we L'amour de I'art presents the work of some 70 artists presently at work in France, with the sad exception of Jean Tinguelyt who died two weeks ago Add whose space stands dark pd empty. Each has been afforded a more-or-less equal and entirely self-contained space to fill with his work at his own discretion. This is no show for direct comparisons or unexpected conjunctions: one rather for discrete and particular consideration. Mo0 of the artists are housed in the magnificent Halle Tony Garnier, built by the eponymous architect on the eve of the First World War and now restored as an exhibition centre. Eight are shown at the Muse. d'Art Contemporain itself, In the heart of the old city, with two more in temporary spaces in the streets nearby. And the final six are to be found at the Espace Lyonnais d'Art Contemporain, in the warren-like new development beside the main railway station, Lyon-Perrache. The curators' declared aim is to encourage in the open-minded visitor a response that is visual and sensual before ever it is cerebral, to make him \"think and feel through the eye\". And in so copious a sample, there are bound to be a few who make just such an impression, their work declaring itself on its own terms without gratuitous explanation or fashionable pleading. It is perhaps significant that these, without exception, prove to be among the older artists, whose maturity predates the orthodoxies and easy options of the environmental, conceptual or theatrical installation and the inflated scale. In this respect, the dense expressionist impasto of Eugene Leroy, the torn-poster collages of Jacques Villegle, Martin Barre's cool soft-edged abstraction and Daniel Spoerri's surreal relief assemblages are alike impressive and memorable, and hardly new. All are self-sufficient, integral, well crafted, almost old-fashioned '\"u- '. most. thick, smooth black paint deeply scored to catch the light, at least retains respect for that old autonomy of the worked surface. Francois Morellet, a most distinguished systems constructivist, succumbs to the installation temptation, showing a bare room, the walls stepped out and dropped to the floor.in simple proportion to the space. For the rest it is a matter of chic and elegant convention, I Lp figuration pursued for its Wn humane sake, and no conceptual, political or sociological polemic on the other hand - no radical chic, which is a considerable mercy. What we have is an anthology of the safest sort of the modern curator's art, large, greedy of space, empty of feeling, safe in the museum space for which it was manifestly designed. Oh for some painting, some drawing, something made with bare hands in respojne .to something seen and felt - that would be truly radical. Straight from the New Contemporaries and the Goldsmiths graduates, with which I left off 14 early August, I felt almost athomue.",

   "text_content" : "\"Mozart Now\", the South Bank's bicentenary bash, ended this weekend with four concerts by the Orchestra of the 18th Century under its founder-conductor Frans Bruggen. Over the last decade the orchestra has established itself as the most dashing and exciting of the period-in- strument bands and Brlggen as one of the lead- ers of the authenticity movement, alongside Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the British cadre of Roger Norrington, John Eliot Gardiner and Christopher Hogwood. Briiggen's career has had a fascinating trajec- tory; his emergence as an orchestral conductor built upon his great achievements as a recorder player, perhaps the finest of the second half of this century. As a child in Holland he had been brought up on the sound of the Concertgebouw Orchestra under Eduard Van Beinum, but even then detected something lacking in their Moz- art: \"I found most of their performances of Clas- sical music dishonest, not serving the composer; it was all fantastically played, but something was not right.\" Later when he was well established as a recorder player Brtiggen found himself gradu- ally drawn into conducting, first through the Baroque. Record companies in the late 1950s and early 1960 were keen to promote recorders and harpsichords, and when the repertory became more orchestral someone was needed to direct the performances. Playing old music on an \"old\" instrument authenticity came naturally; \"By the beginning of the 1970s there were enough old string players to have a small orchestra and we moved forward logically, from Telemann to Moz- art. It was a new world; suddenly you heard a Frans Bruggen rehears- ing Mozart symphony with all its beautiful middle ats and no balance problems; the piece played itself.\" Braggen is quick to emphasise that authentic- ity is much more than a cosmetic exercise in colour and texture which replicates the sound of the 18th-century orchestra but not the style and spirit of the performance: \"The rhetoric of the time we know, the canon of tempi we know, the acoustics perhaps less so, the social circmn- stances hardly at all We have to recover the capability of the players to be surprised by the smplest things - contrasts of high and low, loud and soft - and remember that easy pas- sages were easy, and difficult things difficult. After Paganini's time difficult things had to seem easy and easy things had to be made interesting, hence the enormous vibratos and so on. That is hard, but if you have an old instru- ment of course it helps. \"I think Mozart's orchestras were a ruin as regards pitch and ensemble, and not everybody -id the same thing at the same time. Parts that went down decrescendoed, parts that went up crescendoed; the bigger the interval the shorter it was articulated, the narrower the interval the longer it was made, so that you ended up with a fantastic kind of clockwork with each part treated individually. With a modem symphony orchestra you have to teach that approach; they are sonic, rhythmical ensembles, interested in sound. They want to do things together.\" Authenticity has triumphed in baroque per- formances and all but won for Haydn and Moz- art. The battleground has switched now to the early Romantics. Brtggen and his orchestra are completing their Beethoven cycle for Philips and beginning to record Schubert and Mendels- sohn, but he does not foresee his explorations moving forward much farther into the 19th cen- tury. \"The last work you can treat with the same instruments and mentality is Beethoven's Eighth Symphony; Beethoven 9 is the new chap ter. There you need slightly more modern instruments, winds with more keys and valves, strings with chin holders. The crucial period is between Beethoven 9 and Berlioz; by the time of Berlioz the orchestra was fully modernised. That's what I think now, but I must confess that five years ago the last thing I thought we could perform was Beethoven's Third!\" The rewards of being a conductor though are perennial. \"It's attractive to make sound after silence; it's a great moment. One second there's no time, the next it's no fun any more. Time has always attracted me, as a recorder player and as a conductor the ways in which it can be regu- lated and tension built up by giving it in doses; by not beginning earlier than. . . now!, and not a split second later or earlier. One doesn't play for an audience; once the first note has sounded the whole piece is predestined. \"I feel like the moder curator of a beautiful museum, which has access to lots of money, and who can alter his museum when he wants a new room for his early Italians and so on. It's a technological museum; I'm very happy with that. I'm proud of the content of my museum, its literature and its musicians. I just have to try to ventilate and restore my collection, strip ping off the centuries of varnish, as well as a I can.\""

   "text_content" : "HAMIPSTEIA THIA ITEI The word \"bold\" has two meanings, one each side of the Irish Sea. It is evident in its English sense in the decisior to take'a piece from a Scottish writer about women in Belfast. Rona Munro applies it in its Irish sense - bad, naughty, mischievous - to a quartet of characters who, but for the dis- tant thud of gunfire and the talk of their menfolk in the Kesh, could (accents aside) be from 'practically any small Celtic town. To a stage awash with dra- matisations of \"the troubles\", Munro brings a portrayal of Northern' Ireland that is radi- cal in its denial of any political perspective. We know that these women have Republican connections because of what has happened to their hus- bands, sons and brothers, but their physical embattlement merely serves as a catalyst and focus for their emotional mud- die. The real trouble, Monro appears to be saying, is that this is a society of women unable to cope with men. She illustrates her point with a mother, a wife and a daughter, each of whom clings to her worthless idol: Nora (Britta Smith) is the doting mother of a jailed son to whom she sends exotic baskets of fruit in lieu of the traditional maternal fry-up; her daughter, Cassie (Imelda Staunton. on scorch'ng form) Imelda Staunton, Britta Smith, Orla Charlton and Catherine Cusack is disgusted by her husband but worships her dead, wife- beating father; while the madonna-like Marie (Orla Charlton) keeps desperate faith with a husband who was inevi- tably a hopeless philanderer. Their humdrum disatisfac- tions are brought into the open by the arrival of a mysterious, thieving waif in white who arrives in Marie's parlour and procedes - with moon-faced truculence - to demolish their self-deceptions. Munro's writing is at its best dealing with the oblique con- verational rituals of her char- acters: over an episode of Blind Date on television, Nora and Cassie speculate about the motives of the bedraggled young infiltrator (Catherine Cusack); over a name-the-price auction at a local disco, they squabble about Cassie's mor- als, while Marie is boldly win- ning a Magimix food processor. The point that this is an ordinary group of women is echoed on every level of pro- duction: through John Dove's direction, Robert Jones' immaculately dowdy set, anc the unstintingly honest perfor- mances which frame the one extraordinary feature of the evening - Imelda Staunton's explosive portrayal of a woman tugging at the end of the com- munal tether.

   "text_content" : "ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE This Norwegian contralto is in constant demand as Erda in Wagner's Ring cycle - for Peter Hall's and Harry Kup- fer's successive versions at \" New nday at Covent Garden. No wonder: the voice is notably large and .warit, the contralto depths are genuine and in mid-register her timbre is not only alluring but succulent. Nor is there any awkward break, as many a wide-ranging phrase in her St. John's programme attested; and she is tall, poised, fair and musically alert. She seemed a natural choice to open the, Norwegian Victoria Music Festival, which contin- ues in Smith Square until the 16th. That promises interesting rewards: leading Norwegian performers in a broad range of song and chamber music, with every programme - except that of the Norwegian Winds including some of their countrymen's music, from Grieg to current composers. The \"Victoria\" part of the liame isn't geographical, but belongs to a new CD label that hopes to spread Norwegian music abroad; Miss Gjevang's recital was introduced by sev eral sales-talks. As a song recitalist, never- theless, she is partly an Erda, partly just a promising inter- preter who needs more pol- ished control of her upper voice, and more cosmopolitan command of languages. At the start of her Liszt group, I sup- posed her to be sin \"If I r ree giveway signs (very discreet) in \"The Grave and the Rose\" indicated that she was trying out French. In Falla's Seven Popular Songs, her deeply obscure Spanish captured too little of the ethnic-proverbial tang of the words. Neither she nor her otherwise first-rate pia- nist Einar Steen-N6kleberg made much of Falla's tense, vital rhythms. Any contralto recitalist must occasionally brave the upper reaches. Miss Gjevang's plucky excursions there were on a lower level than the finely etched phrases in her best reg- ister. Though she captured the feeling of Grieg's evergreen \"Water-lily\" delightfully, half its charm depends upon those eager little fifth-leaps up and down again, and few of the upper notes were quite in time. She needs to decide whether to settle for her Erda-range and perfect it - or to work toward a better-focussed mezzo too, one that can do justice to her musical instincts. Her remark- able instrument should be capable of rising to that. David Murray",

   "text_content" : "WHEN France's Carnaud and Britain's Metal Box combined their packaging businesses two years ago to create the biggest European supplier in the industry, the deal was widely acclaimed as the model of a modern Euro-merger. But today the troubled history of the joint venture, CMB Packag- ing, appears more instructive as a case study in the pitfalls facing corporate marriages across European borders. Some of CMB's difficulties are sui generis. Much contro- versy surrounds the personal- ity of Mr Jean-Marie Descar- pentries, its chairman, whose future is due to be discussed at a board meeting tomorrow. Though Mr Descarpentries pro- vided visionary early leader- ship, critics accuse him of an increasingly autocratic approach which has led to fric- tion with main shareholders and managers. However, the evidence sug- gests that these tensions reflect more fundamental prob- lems, common to other types of Euro-merger. To its credit, CMB quickly saw the impor- tance of creating its own inde- pendent identity. But strenu- ous efforts to develop a distinctive trans-European cul- ture seem to have succumbed to feuding between French and British management styles. Differing attitudes Differing attitudes on the part of CMB's parents have not made things easier. Carnaud saw the joint venture as a way to deepen its involvement in packaging. Metal Box's com- mitment has seemed more equivocal - particularly since it acquired Caradon, a bath- room fixtures maker, in late 1989. Against this background, a joint venture in which ulti- mate control is equally split scarcely encourages unity of purpose. An outright acquisition which gave one partner undis- puted management control might have been preferable. That this did not happen appears due at least partly to fears that the seller would lose face by being seen to surrender to a European competitor. Such concerns are not unique to CMB. They have also limited the link-up between France's Renault and Sweden's Volvo to an unwieldy half-merger and have thwarted attempts by European computer makers to consolidate. Political chauvinism Yet it is precisely these sen- sitivities - often aggravated by political chauvinism - which have undermined so many attempted mergers of equals. Only rarely do large European cross-border mergers in the same industry marry partners with truly comple- mentary strengths. They are more likely to combine differ- ent management cultures but similar industrial weaknesses, the result of duplication of resources encouraged by national trade barriers and industrial champion policies. Split management control can simply lead to squabbling about how the burdens of restructuring should be shared. The most effective trans-Eu- ropean mergers, such as the formation of ABB by Sweden's Asea and Switzerland's Brown- Boveri, have put one company firmly in charge. Though ABB has continued to expand world- wide by acquisition, it has not flinched from the savage prun- ing essential to the health of its European operations. But too many other companies still seem to believe that ramming together European businesses in pursuit of size and scale will improve their competitiveness. There is little conclusive evi- dence that in most industries size is paramount, still less that ungainly \"Euro-champi- ons\" are well-suited to achieve it. The real priorities for Euro- pean industry are to rational- ise capacity, use it more pro- ductively and expand on global markets. Trans-European mergers offer one route to those goals. But it is by no means the only - or necessar- ily always the most effective - one."

   "text_content" : "THE LAW Society yesterday placed a manifesto with 68 pro- posals on law reform before the autumn party political confer- ences. On the same day, Sir John May's inquiry resumed its hearings into the cases of the Maguire Seven, sentenced to between five and 14 years in prison after being wrongly con- victed of possession of explo- sives. The coincidence of these two events highlights the need for reform of the criminal jus- tice system following well-pub- licised miscarriages of justice such as the Maguires, the Guildford Four and the Bir- mingham Six. Responsibility for the legal system is currently divided between several government departments: the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's Depart- ment, the attorney-general and sundry others which admins- ter tribunals such as the Inland Revenue. This wastes resources, but it also weakens accountability to parliament. And with the lord chancellor, who appoints judges and administers the higher courts, sitting in the House of Lords there is no minister in the Commons answerable to MPs on these matters To make matters worse, the home secretary - in whose hands rest decisions on miscar- riages of justice - is also responsible for law enforce- ment. A constitutional separa- tion of law and order would make the pursuit of both demonstrably more effective. The Law Society - in com- mon with the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and law reform bodies such as Justice - proposes the creation of a Ministry of Justice, responsibl for administering all courts and tribunals. Thee functions could be concentrated in the Lord Chancellor's Department, but a minister sitting in the Commons and accountable to MPs would be preferable. Ide- ally, the post should be filled by a lay person - just as it is desirable that the minister of health is not a doctor. And if it is felt essential to retain the post of lord chan- cellor, he could head a judicial appointments commission, to preserve the independence of the judges and magistrates. In this task, he should be joined by judges, lawyers, academics, laymen and especially lay women. Other structural changes are necessary if the administration of criminal justice is to be restored to public esteem. Most of the recent verdicts of unsafe convictions have been inspired by television reporting and campaigns by relatives, rather than by the legal system itself. There is now widespread sup- port for an independent judi- cial body to review miscar- riages of justice - endorsed by Lord Scarman, the distin- guished former law lord. There remains an imbalance in the resources available to prosecution and defence to examine evidence which should be redressed. And with so many miscarriages o justice hinging on controversial foren- sic evidence, an independent forensic science service could assist in improving the quality of such evidence and to its interpretation In court. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice - curntly deliberating under Lord Rund- man of D*ford - is no doubt couidrring proposals such as these for reforming the e of justice. But dlear divio of responsibilities and unclut- tered lines of accountability are essential if the reputation of th sysm of ustice is to be we Mftm"

At least that seems to be the nicest explanation of why Morgan Stanley International has won the mandate. Giving it to a French bank would have smacked of favouritism, and Britain does not have a big enough merchant bank in Ecu and dollars to do the job properly. Even so there will be a few eyebrows raised in some quarters. After all when the US-based World Bank made its public borrowing debut some 40 years ago it favoured Morgan Stanley and First Boston. Britain's hardpessed merchant banks won't admit it, but they could do with some soonfeeding. They would not nave been overlooked in France or Germany."

   "text_content" : "tatives suDCommittee on teie- communications and finance. While the committee treated Mr Warren Buffett, the newly- installed chairman of Salomon, with considerable respect (and appeared satisfied with his pledge to clean up the firm), it came down hard on Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve, and Mr Jerome Powell, assistant secre- tary of the US Treasury, who are both responsible for super- vising the Treasury markets. In a series of sharp exchanges, Congressmen pressed them to account for the regulatory failures spot- lighted by the Salomon affair. They asked why it took two months for the Treasury and the Fed to contact Salomon about their misgivings over bids submitted by the firm in a February auction and why it took so long for the two agen- cies to react to the May auc- tion of two-year notes when a huge \"squeeze\" had so clearly disrupted the market. Last Wednesday's hearing confirmed what Congress sus- pected: that there are holes in the supervisory system. There is unusual unanimity in Wash- ington that the Treasury mar- ket needs reform. Influential Representatives and Senators from both political parties have called for change, and the Bush administration, in the form of Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, has admit- ted that the process by which government securities are sold needs reviewing. That review is already under way. Four separate House and Senate committees are investi- gating the Salomon affair, and they want to hurry through reforms to the rules governing the Treasury market before investors lose more confidence. The regulators, however, are dragging their feet. The SEC ~f~p;~~ \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bondsmen: New York Federal Reserve president, Gerald Corrigan, left, and Salomon Brothers' Waren Bullet and the Fed have asked for at least six months to assess the findings of the various investi- gations into the Salomon affair. Congress does not want to wait that long - it is work- ing to a deadline of October 1, when the 1986 Government Securities Act, the legal frame- work for regulation of Trea- sury auctions, is scheduled for re-authorisation. Mr Edward Markey, the Democrat who chaired last Wednesday's subcommittee hearing, has already suggested several reforms. These include: * Making any violation of Treasury auction rules illegal under securities law - at pres- ent rule violations are not cov- ered by legislation; * Requiring primary dealers to set up mandatory proce- dures to detect bidding or trad- ing irregularities; * Requiring dealers to report large positions held by them- selves or their customers; * Getting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US markets watchdog, to write sales practice rules for dealers and customers; * Giving the SEC powers to oversee the dissemination of price and trading information. It will be difficult for the securities industry, even with its lobbying power in Washing- ton, to oppose Mr Markey's proposals. The suggestion that large traders report their posi- tions might be seen as a threat to the competitive advantages dealers gain from holding big, unseen positions in the post- auction market, but securities houses recently accepted a sim- ilar requirement for equities trading, so they will be hard stretched to argue against it for bonds. For the longer term, legisla- tors would like to alter the way regulatory power over the bond markets is divided between the Fed, the Treasury and the SEC. Under the pres- ent system, the Treasury has overall responsibility for mar- ket supervision, while relying on the Fed to manage the weekly auctions of government securities. The SEC's duty, by contrast, is to ensure investor protection and to see that all US securities firms stay within the law. The politicians would like to see co-ordination between the three agencies improved or - better - the bulk of the supervisory burden given to a single agency. Whatever the outcome, the SEC is likely to end up with more power than before. The embarrassment felt by the Treasury and the Fed over their failure to spot the Salo- mon wrongdoings earlier has strengthened the SEC's case for a bigger role in the Trea- sury bond market. The SEC can also count on the support of Congressional legislators, who would like to break up the cosy relationship between the primary dealers, the Fed and the Treasury. At the heart of that relation- ship is a panel of senior dealers that regularly meets the Trea- sury to advise on upcoming auctions. Mr Corrigan of the New York Fed has admitted that he is unhappy about the panel, and has said that its use is under review in the light of the Salomon affair. Yet politicians doubt that the Treasury and the Fed will want to impose tougher regula- tions on dealers who are ltant whob worse0 1uos y mthte+ Teaury-in them'+ 1 .s tes - at s eapically to the 004 Unk e the reg- ulat' iitthe o thuleted: \"K lnoked like the d ran the maket.

On auction day, the dealers talk on the phone about the scale of demand for the new issue. They then place their bids and their customers' bids at the Slast moment, using the infor- mation gleaned from the mar- ket to judge the price and size of a bid most likely to be accepted by the Treasury. Breaking the dealers' stran- glehold on the market will not be easy, particularly as the government still believes the current system is the best way to ensure its securities are sold at the cheapest price. There are other factors at work, how- ever, which may ensure that the dealers' near-monopoly of information about the market is eroded. The Treasury, for example, has been considering automating the auction system for several years. The primary dealers have always opposed the idea of an automated mar ket. If investors bid for them selves by computer, dealers would be denied the informa tion about customer orders that gives them their huge advantage at auction time. Dealer opposition to automa- tion has stalled reforms in the past, but the Salomon affair has strengthened the case for change. The Treasury has asked the New York Fed to speed up its investigation, orig- inally launched at a leisurely pace a year ago, into an elec- tronic auction system. Automating the auction pro- cess would be a relatively straightforward task. At pres- ent bids are submitted on writ- ten forms which are handed over to the Treasury on auc- tion day. A computer system could be built that would allow investors to input their orders electronically. The system could include terminals that displayed price and volume information about bids, which would satisfy demands for wider dissemination of trade data and make it tougher for dealers to rig the auction. The Treasury is also considering making customers sign a receipt for auctioned securities, a move which would prevent dealers from faking customer orders as Salomon has admit- ted doing. Congress, however, has got the bit between its teeth and is likely to want more widescale reform. In the coming months the Treasury, the Fed and the primary dealers will face a tough battle to convince legis- lators that a system which grants a handful of big firms cartel-like powers over the world's largest and most influ- ential financial market deserves to survive.",

   "text_content" : "r Edwln Artt is by all accounts a man whohates to lose at anyttin he does. So the chair- man -tpo t er - Gamble will find it partcularly galling to staid thisi oning before the board o the consumer prod- ucts giant and eat a sizeable slice of humble pie. Mr ArtSt wil be reporting on an extraordinry mijudg- ment by P&G's management this summer in launching a witch-hunt to find, apparently unsucessfully, who was leak- ing company information to the press. For the inquiry has turned into a public relations disaster for P&G, which stands accused of trampling on press freedom and invading individ- ual privacy. That is none too smart for a business which spends more than $1.5bn a year on advertising designed to persuade the world that its soapsuds, toothpaste, nappies and detergents are superior to anyone else's. But the conse- quences go well beyond PR, raising questions about P&G's secretive corporate culture. The story began last June when the Wall Street Journal ran an article by Ms Alecia Swasy, a Pittsburgh-based cor- respondent on management changes at P&G and its possi- ble sale of various businesses. The article quoted unnamed \"current and former P&G managers\". The company, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and dominates the econ- omy in the area, responded by calling in the local police. P&G demanded an inquIry, citing a state business statute which makes it an offence for an employee to disclose confi- dential business information to an outsider. The police obliged, no doubt mindful of P&G's power in the commu- nity. And, seemingly oblivious to a potential conflict of inter- est, they placed the case in the hands of a fraud squad detec- tive who drew a second salary moonlighting as an adviser to... Procter & Gamble. The police set to the task with vigour, and used four grand jury subpoenas to order the local telephone company, Cincinnati Bell, to sort through the records of S00,000 home and business telephone lines, and 40m individual calls, in search of anyone who had dialled the Journal's Pitts- burgh office or Ms Swasy's home. Uproar ensued. Newspa- pers attacked P&G for abusing the US constitution's guaran- tee of press freedom and the convention that journalists' sources remain confidential. Civil libertarians said both Ms Swasy and the citizens of Cin- cinnati had had theÃ½r privacy invaded. After weeks of self-justiflca- tion, P&G climbed down last week when Mr Artzt circulated a letter to employees admit- tig \"an error of judgment\" and rerttig the embaras \"We crated a prl than the one w re t to solve,\" be added. But how could P60, with all its experience n Image-manp- ulation, make such a funda- mental error? The answer must be sought nl the com- pany's distinctive corporate culture. P&G Is ne of the old- est, proudest compaiei in America, with a repution for cautious, slowmoving bureau- cracy laced with a touch of arrogance. Secure in its Cin- cinnati redoubt, It is also insu- lar, clannish and secretive. Groufaloyalty Is fostered by its exllent tretmet of employ- ees and its active community involvement. It promotes only from within the orgnisation, and does not rehire those who leave. Employees are barred from disclosing the most triv- ial information to outsiders and its chairman seldom appears on Wall Street. All this may or may not help P&G's bottom line. What is certain is it would make its management predisposed to fury at the leaks - particu- larly since the company claims at least ne rival also received confidential information - and insensitive to the outside world's view of its subsequent action. Mr Artzt's personality may have also played a role. A blunt, aggressive manager, who made his reputation building P&G's international business, he took over the top Job two years ago and has won praise for making P&G more responsive to fast-changing competition. In this case, however, he was perhaps a little too responsive. Would P&G's cau- tious old management have called in the cops quite as quickly? Although Mr Artzt now acknowledges having made a mistake, he has inti- mated that this was merely a PR failure, and that P&G was legally and ethically right. The legalities are for law- yers to argue over, as they will if a number of threatened suits descends on P&G. But ethi- cally, it can hardly be right for a business to demand privacy itself and then invade that of 800,000 Cincinnati citizens. Nor should a company which has prospered in a free-market economy seek to muzzle the press, which is an integral part of that freedom. The P&G board might remind its chairman of the advice given by William Coo- per Procter, grandson of the firm's founder, when he stepped down as chairman in 1930: \"Always try to do about what's right. If you do that, nobody can really find fault.\" Mr Artzt appears to have placed a private, corporate perception of right above a wrong done to the public."

   "text_content" : "4 ntitna's voteru deliv- ered their verdict on the ftfree-market economic reform programme of President Carlos Menem's government at the weekend. Surprising as it may seem in a country that was until recently dismissed as unreformable, they like it. It was Mr Menem's reforms that laid the foundation for the government's crushing victory in Sunday's gubernatorial and congressional elections. The ruling Peronist party carried 10 of the 12 provinces being con- tested, and retained the key province of Buenos Aires by a large margin. Mr Menem, elected on a pop- ulist platform amid economic chaos in 1989, is at first sight an unusual apostle of free mar- ket reform. In earlier incarne- tions, his Peronist party had provided the model for the stat- ist economic policies followed all over Latin America since the 1950s. Nevertheless, in two years, he has dramatically shrunk the role of the state: slashing tar- iffs, abolishing exchange restrictions and price controls, selling off large chunks of nationalised industries and ending government interfer- ence in private sector wage determination. Even more surprising for the hardened pessimists - and there are many in Argentina after half a century of unremit- ting economic decline - there are signs that the policy is beginning to pay off. A country derided as an eco nomic basket case only two years ago now expects 5 per cent growth in 1991. Monthly inflation has fallen to 1.3 per cent in August, the lowest monthly figure in 20 years. A bull run on the Buenos Aires stock exchange has more than doubled share prices in the last six weeks. There is even a revival of interest in Argentina among foreign investors and creditors, enough to allow Argentina's return to the international bond markets for the first time since the onset of the debt cri sis. There are still many doubts, but hopes are rising that Argentina may soon be able to join Chile and Mexico in sloughing off the shackles of the 1982 debt crisis. It is hard to believe this is the same insolvent nation that in 1989 and 1990 was on the verge of civil unrest as three hyper-inflationary spasms threatened to tear it apart. But the recent progress is largely a reflection of, and a response to, the depths to which the nation had sunk by the end of the 1980s. A Buenos Aires banker explains that until recently, \"everyone could live off the state because Argentina was once a wealthy country. That ended in 1989 when the state went bankrupt. Hyperinflation scared a lot of people and woke them up to reality. No other country touched bottom the way we did\". There is a wider lesson. In last weekend's election, the Argentine electorate has underlined what the success of the ruling Institutional Revolu- tionary Party in Mexico hinted at in its mid-term elections last month: that free-market eco- nomic reform programmes can be vote-winners. Moreover, unlike in Chile and Mexico - where reform programmes were built in a military dictatorship (in the former case) or a virtual one- party state (the latter) - the success of the Argentine exam- ple would suggest that demo- cratic government in Latin America and tough economic policies are not necessarily incompatible. If any single individual can be said to be responsible for the government's electoral vic- tory, it is Mr Domingo Cavallo, tne economy minister. He is now by far the most popular member of the government and even took to campaigning in the provinces, an unusual move in a country where econ- omy ministers are usually heartily detested. Mr Miguel Angel Broda, one of Argentina's most influential business consultants, says: \"Menem really began govern- ing when Cavallo became econ- omy minister in January. Cavallo made Menem, who is an intuitive politician, into an effective leader.\" The forceful, Harvard-trained Mr Cavallo brought a new degree of deter- mination and coherent think- ing to a government that lacked a clear idea of how to introduce market reforms. He has improved public finances, lowered import tar- iffs, begun a thoroughgoing deregulation campaign, pegged the inflation-battered currency, the austral, to the US dollar and tidied up the government's messy and corrupt privatisa- tion programme. Above all, he stopped print- ing money to finance budget deficits and increased tax reve- nues, an achievement in itself \\3 in a country with rampant tax evasion. In August, tax reve- nues rose to US$1.6bn, 20 per cent more than a year ago. The result is falling inflation and interest rates combined with growing business and con- sumer confidence. Mr Cavallo, who is Mr Menem's fourth economy min- ister, declines to take all the credit himself. He says: \"What is happening today originated in changes that began with the restoration of democracy in 1983. Argentina's problems were always problems of inade- quate rules, institutions and disorganisation.\" The previous government of Radil Alfonsin recreated Argentina's shat- tered political institutions; now the Menem administration is recreating a market economy. Credit is also due to Mr Menem himself. He astonished everyone when he embraced free market policies on becom- ing president, the very policies his party had bitterly opposed since its incept'on in 1947. One of Mr Menem's advisers says: \"Only someone like Menem would have the audacity, the instinct and sheer madness to try something like this.\" Government growth projec- tions that may have once sounded absurd now seem almost realistic. Mr Juan Llach, a key aide to Mr Cavallo, says annual growth rates of 7-10 per cent a year are entirely feasible, as economic stability releases years of savings and the investment rate doubles to 20 per cent of gross domestic product. The government even pre- dicts that in a few years Argen- tina will face a labour short- age. Mr Cavallo plans to negotiate a comprehensive reduction of Argentina's $61bn foreign debt in 1992, and he has vowed to privatise or wind up all state enterprises by 1994. Not that Argentina's eco- nomic problems have by any means been solved. Inflation, for example, is by no means conquered. Although now very low by Argentine standards, it must rapidly fall to interna- tional levels if the fixed exchange rate is to hold, Some private economists think a new round of spending cuts and tax increases will be needed now, and this could slow growth. Then there is the problem of corruption, which although it is declining remains a serious concern. Businessmen say Argentina must crack down hard on corruption if it is to attract foreign investment; independent observers say Mr Menem has still not done enoughto root it out. Although he purged the gov- ernment in January under American pressure, no officials have been charged, while oth- ers with a doubtful past remain in government. The government has not acted to break up powerful car- tels and oligopolies and is act- ing too slowly to create an effi- cient civil service able to police the economy and enforce com- petition. The lumbering con- glomerates that dominate Argentina's corporate scene will not survive unless they are forced to undergo trau- matic change. Some observers doubt that their managements will be able to modernise, cut costs and carve out new mar- kets after growing in a closed economy sealed off from nearly all competition. In a way, what has been achieved so far is the relatively painless part of economic reform. Real wages have fallen only slightly; employment has risen despite the elimination of 98,000 public sector jobs this year. In accomplishing the more difficult next steps, Mr Menem faces another problem: he lacks the unequivocal support of any political or social group. He is breaking up the unions, once the backbone of Peronist power, and has allowed the Peronist party to wither. The military, long the main power in the land, have now accepted a secondary role in national affairs. Although heartened by his policies, the business com- munity also supports other centre-right politicians. Even US officials admit in private that they sometimes find the impulsive Mr Menem both unnerving and unreliable. Instead of having a depend- able political base to fall back on, Mr Menem must rely heavily on his political instinct and his ability to interpret and win over public opinion, much as the populist Juan Per6n did 50 years ago. This makes him peculiarly vulnerable: if eco- nomic reform falters or fails to produce the rewards promised by Mr Cavallo, Argentina's notoriously volatile public opinion may yet turn against Mr Menem."

   "text_content" : "From Mr Paul Hipps. Sir, David Waller (\"Law of Silence\", August 29) is right in saying that the lot of the senior partner of a leading firm of accountants is a frustrating one. The article poses a number of questions in relation to the audit of Polly Peck Interna- tional (PPI) and, indeed, simi- lar questions have been raised in relation to companies audited by other firms. With regard to PPI my dilemma is as follows. While I am satisfied with the audit work carried out in relation to PPI and I know that my colleagues and I can answer the questions posed, any detailed answers that we give would result in betraying a cli- ent confidence and might prej- udice any legal proceedings involving the directors. As a result, we are obliged to remain silent and indeed are thus prevented from fully defending our firm. My point is therefore this: it is as frustrating for Stoy Hay- ward to remain silent about the PPI audit as it is for you and your readers to be denied the information. The \"Law of Silence\" to which you refer does not allow us to defend ourselves or to answer the questions which your article has raised. We are, howaver, neverthe- less subjected to the inferences that result from these unan- swered questions, a position which we would naturally pre- ser to defend. The cloak, it would seem, can shelter the client more than the accountant.

   "text_content" : "Irom Mr Clifford L Brody. Sir, Both your teaser on page I and the page 2 headline of September 5 (\"Economic reforms now impossible\", \"Power shift precludes big eco- nomic reforms\") about the Soviet Union certainly cap- tured my attention. However, John Lloyd's con- clusion left me in serious doubt as to whether he truly understands capitalism. To state that \"economic reform in the Soviet Union is now impos- sible because there is no centre on which to base it\" is as fun- damentally incorrect as is the view of Professor Shatalin - to whom your article referred - in proposing that there can be a multi-country system set up from the centre as a hothouse in which capitalism can take root and grow. My company has advised multinational banks and com- mercial firms, companies not so large, and a host of US banks - in each case regard- ing their own or their corpo- rate customers' initiatives in the former Soviet bloc coun- tries. We have found that the last thing serious long-term inves- tors want is someone \"in the centre\" dictating how it should all work. We want a workable set of rules governing dispute resolution (temporary subst- tutes will work until the courts there do) and assurances on ownership and profit repatri- tion. The smartest long-term investors, though, know that these protections did not spring up overnight \"fra the centLe\" in their own countries and will not emerge quickly anywhere in the former Soviet bloc, not even the former East Germany. They are investing by improvising along the way, with the smartest ploughing profits back in so that their investments grow. To invest successfully in the former Soviet bloc means get ting used to no \"centre\" as there once was. Capitalism works better in this country and in yours when people at the centre stop trying to script the rest of us and instead let entrepreneurs chase after busi- ness. We are succeeding in the former Soviet bloc every time we carefully identify and pack- age mutual benefit together with the rest of the incentive- we bring to the negotiating table. Each time we succeed, the eventual consumer for our goods or services is the rea_ winner. That means 300m or more winners in the Soviet Union and its republics - if the people newly in charge there are encouraged, not con- demned, for letting go instead of trying to do it \"from the centre\", and for letting law evolve to reflect what works efficiently and equitably in the marketplace. Isn't that exactly how we here in the US and you in Britain did it and do it even today? Clifford L Brody, aiobrd L Brody Associates 1819 L Strut NW, WashitWon DC VSA",

   "text_content" : "from Dr Michael Cross. Sir, I read with interest your coverage of the TUC confer- ence in Glasgow as regards the debate on the adoption of a \"European model\" of industrial relations. As somebody respon sible for leading our company- work with unions in the UK, Germany, Italy and Poland in a small (Â£100m turnover) con tract packing business, may I make the following observa- tions. 1. We already operate a \"comr pany enterprise board\" struc- ture in the UK with the district full-time officer and site con vener sitting on the board as ex officio members. This has worked extremely well as regards jointly developing and implementing long-term deci sions on investment in people, plant and equipment. The union role in this instance has been elevated to one being actively and equally involved in the forming of goals, strategies and tactics which are fundamental to the long-term well-being and devel opment of union members. This experience, I am sure, is not restricted to our operation, and we would welcome the for- mal endorsement of this approach throughout the UK 2 At our two sites in Germany we operate the usual YGermn model\". The main differences I have found are the lack of sus picion of the relationship between \"unions and manage ment\", and the high quality of education and training avail- able for union officers (both lay and fll-time). In terms of -peration there are few diler ences from our UK exper- eace~ eacept that the novety of our UK arangmnta does, I ol, provide extra enerI to our meeting.

   "text_content" : "T he Liberale Democrats are enjoying their fanta sies. Let us indulge one of them; it just might come true. Britain's third party could be on its way to becoming the Democrats (or is it the Repub- icans?) in a two-party system not unlike that of the United States. It has made a start. Now what it needs is a great deal of good luck, and an out- right Conservative victory at the next general election. In that set of circumstances it would be well placed to suc- ceed where the Alliance failed. We know one of the reasons for that failure. The Alliance, a partnership between the for- mer Liberal party and the erstwhile Social Democratic party, came crashing down in smithereens after the 1987 election. Detailed accounts by Lord Jenkins (then Mr Roy Jenkins) and Dr David Owen, two of the founders of the SDP, make it plain that the single most destructive force was Dr Owen's temperamen- tal inability to work with his colleagues. But before Dr Owen appeared on the scene Lord Jenkins and Sir David Steel, the then Liberal leader, had been right to discern that there was a longing in Britain for a third choice. During most of the 1980s Labour was not electable, while the Con- servatives under Mrs Thatcher won three times mainly for that reason. The other two parties competed for the leadership of the oppo- sition. The Alliance nearly won, but nearly was not good enough. Two years ago, as Labour began its steady climb back towards electoral respectability and a long run of high scores in the opinion polls, it seemed as if the story was over. Today it looks as if there may be a sequel, with a quite different d6nouement. As I say, this is a morning for indulging the fantasies of the underdog party. Much depends on how Labour fares on polling day. A convincing overall majority for Mr Neil Kinnock would render the Liberal Democrats irrelevant, although they would harass the new government from the opposition benches. But that is the least likely outcome. It always has beep, even during the high summer of Laboui opinion poll leads. Yet the matter is not set- tled: the polls suggest that the two larger parties are fairly evenly matched. If the Conser vatives win with a minuscule majority, Mr Kinnock may survive to fight another day. His slogan would be, \"one more push, and the Tories are out\". If Labour emerges as the largest party in a hung parlia- ment, he might be able to form a government on the basis that the Liberal Demc crats and assorted national- ists would be bound to support him. Such an out- come is possible, but by no means certain. It is at least equally likely that Mr John Major will lead the Conserva- tives to a convincing fourth victory. On last week's evi- The Liberal Democrats contain more trust-busters than the DTI dence, that would be my bet. Labour politicians have pri- vately spent much of the sum- mer asking each other what would happen then. Clearly there would be a strong move to oust Mr Kinnock and replace him with either Mr John Smith, the shadow chan cellor, or one of the younger stars - the passionate Mr Gordon Brown, say, or the hugely telegenic Mr Tony Blair. The pent-up fury of the Labour left would explode, fragmenting the party. Mr Ashdown would rub home the point that Labour was a four time loser. It would have done everything its own history permitted it to do. Nationalis ation, unilateral disarma ment, withdrawal from the European Community have already been ditched. The market has been, if not embraced, given a perfunc tory hug. Labour's electoral organisation is superb; its pre sentations masterpieces of professionalism. If it was knocked out with all that plus, say, 2.75m unemployed supposedly frightening voters away from the government, the Labour party would have lost its reason for existence. Shorn of ideology and all sem- blance of conviction in an effort to win, it would have failed to live up to its sole remaining purpose, the pur- suit of power. Enter Mr Ashdown, stage right. In a decade in which even the teeniest whiff of socialism is not a strong seller he heads a party with no socialist baggage to discard. He can dream of the tide of history, which displaced the Liberals and brought Labour forward during the first half of the century. That was a time when in some minds the threat of communism had to be parried by building a dem- ocratic socialist party in Britain and making it part of the political establishment. Perhaps the tides are now flowing the other way. The Liberal Democrats are staunchly non-socialist. The former Liberals' often shaky belief in the market and fiscal prudence has been strength- ened by the injection of robust SDP blood. The new party is even fashioning a strong competition policy. It contains more trust-busters than does the Department of Industry under the Conserva- tive Mr Peter Lilley. Liberal Democrats draw the conclusion that the tide will now bring them in as Labour fades. The years of Labour ascendancy, begun after the first world war, would be over. They would constitute a 70-year blip, democratic in nature, but nevertheless par- allel to the authoritarian 70- year blip in the Soviet Union. Some Liberal Democrats believe that, given time, their new party will replace Labour completely. British politics would then still work on the US two-party principle. This is consonant with its built-in first-past-the-post voting mechanism. Others acknowl- edge that Labour will take a lot of withering away. They prefer to aim for a multi-party Britain in which most govern- ments are coalitions of parties elected by proportional repre- sentation. Labour will almost certainly pin PR to its mast- head if it loses next time; the question is how fast support for the Liberal Democrats would expand as support for Labour contracted. This bubble will burst with the next opinion poll showing an increase in Labour sup- port. Meanwhile, let it float."

   "text_content" : "By David Churchill and Andrew Jack THEATREGOERS faced confusion at box offices last night as Keith Prowse, the world's largest ticket agency, was put in receivership with debts of more than Â£7m The collapse of the ticket and hotel reservations agency, corporate hospitality, and travel group came yesterday when the accountancy firm of Grant Thornton was appointed receivers at mid-day to Keith Prowse Holdings, the umbrella company privately owned by brothers Mr Ranjit Anand and Mr Dev Anand. The group has 63 outlets in the UK and 16 concessions, many in hotels and department stores, which specialise in theatre, concert, sport and holi day bookings. It employes about 650 staff and in the year to end of June this year, it pro- duced management accounts showing a loss of Â£3m on group turnover of Â£160m. About 2,000 theatre tickets are sold through Keith Prowse agencies each day. Most Lon- don theatres said they would accept them until the weekend. But there were reports last night that not all theatres were honouring Keith Prowse vouchers. There are also doubts as to whether 20,000 corporate hospi- tality ticket packages for next month's Rugby World Cup will be honoured. The company's collapse was blamed on the impact of the Gulf War and recession. However, the company also invested f5m in expanding its American operations which failed to produce any return and helped lead to its collapse. Fewer theatre and other ticket bookings this summer meant that cash flow was stretched: the company was paying thea- tres five weeks after tickets were sold, more than twice the normal payment period. About half the group's turn- over came from the Expotel international hotel reserva tions agency which was sold by the receivers yesterday to The Modern Group, another hotel reservations agency. The receivers said that about 230 jobs would be secured by this sale, but gave a warning that redundancies were inevi table unless all the other com- panies in the group were sold quickly. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which called in the receivers, was Keith Prowse's biggest secured creditor and was owed about Â£3m. The collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter- national (BCCI) was also owed a Â£1.5m overdraft. \"We're not under a great deal of pressure from BCCI for that at the moment,\" said Mr Malcolm Shierson, one of the three joint receivers, yester- day. The other two are Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Iain Allan. The Keith Prowse travel agency operations have not been put into receivership as the receivers hope to avoid the calling in of the bond guaran- tees by the Association of Brit- ish Travel Agents.

   "text_content" : "By Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Norma Cohen 'HE SECURITIES and Investments Board has ruled out allowing some financial services sales organisations to offer products from a limited range of companies. Under the current system of \"polarisation\", sales organisa. tions must either be indepen- dent - offering the products of all companies - or tied to one particular provider. In a discussion paper pub- lished yesterday, the SIB rejected the creation of an intermediate \"multi-tied\" cate- gory. SIB said that it was not satis- fied that multi-tying would bring \"demonstrable benefits for investors\". Sir David Walker, chairman, said the abolition of polarisation would result in a lot of independent financial advisers becoming multi-tied, which would reduce the independent sector. Multi-ties would also lead to companies restructuring their costs and commission levels - an expense which would be passed on to the consumer. The SIB makes an exception for investment trusts and unit trusts, which it proposes to exclude from the polarisation regime. Commission rates for these investments are substan tially lower than for life assur ance products. A spokesman for National Westminster Bank, the UK's largest independent provider of financial services, said the SIB's move to reaMrm the mer- its ., pblarisation would not hafemuch impact on an indus- try which had little appetite for multi-tied status. He noted that NatWest clients appeared more interested in the solvency and reputation of a financial -dviser than whether it was independent or tied. As part of its review of the retailing of investment prod- ucts, the SIB also proposed replacing the requirement to ive \"best advice\" in favour of providing \"suitable advice\". It argued that many indepen- dent financial advisers had interpreted best advice to apply to choosing the best- performing company in a par- ticular field rather than to selecting the' ost appropriate, product for the client. But Ms Jane Best, director of financial services for the Con- sumers' Association, said of the proposal: \"How can you allow advisers to sell a good product if they know of a bet- ter product elsewhere?\" The SIB said \"best\" advice was not always the most suit- able. \"Suitability\" would mean that the adviser would not be able to recommend a policy that people would be better off without.

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels POLAND yesterday threatened to cancel talks on an associa- tion agreement with the Euro- pean Community. The move came as the EC moved to defuse a row over east European market access for beef, which left France embarrassingly isolated when foreign ministers met in Brus- sels last Friday. The dispute \"looks close to being resolved\", a senior Brus- sels offcial said yesterday. Mr Jacek Sarlusa-Woski, the Polish government representa- tive in negotiations with the EC, said Warsaw was disillu- sioned by the EC foreign minis- ters' failure on Friday to agree to broaden the negotiating mandate on trade terms for exports from Poland, Hungary and Cechoslovakia. Poland had hoped the minis- ters would agree to offer more generous trade terms for its agricultural produce, textile and steel. But France, worried about its beef farmers, blocked pro- posals to offer more generous terms. This was in spite of pledges by EC foreign minis- ters during last month's abor- tive Soviet coup to speed up the talks and give practical support for ex-communist countries which are reforming. At Saturday's Yugoslav peace conference in The Hagu, the French delegation is understood to have told its partner that Paris would put ward aa comapromise. This will probably involve endorsement of some version of the Commission's idea that part of the Increased \"access\" for eat European farm pro- duce would involve the BC fin- ancing these countries' sales to their old Soviet market. Mr Jacques Delors, the Com- mission president, is due to meet Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, later this week ad is expected to impress on her both Brussels' commitment to eastern Europe and the degree of hostility raised by France's stance. Mr Uffe Ellemann Jensen, the Danish foreign minister who called for a EBropan summit to endorse the Com- mission's concessions to Hun- gary, Poland and Caechoslo- vakia, on Friday called the French attitude \"a disgrace\". \"Certain countries make fine statements about urope and democracy, but when it comes to small concessions and con- fronting their own vested nter- ests, they behave as if they are living on another planet\" he said. The row, which Jeopardises the \"anociation agreemen\" Brussels is oerng the three est European countries as a transiton to a thee trade sone and EC entry, was Dkb to go back to the Twelve forein ministers at the end of this month."

   "text_content" : "Iy AlIce Raiwathon and Alan Pike ALL tobacco advertisements will carry tougher health warnings such as \"Smoking Kills\" and \"Smoking Causes Cancer\" from next year under a new voluntary agreement on tobacco promotion announced yesterday by the government. The agreement, which also tightens controls over the pro motion of tobacco products tc young people, was criticised by the health lobby and anti smoking organisations. The announcement comes as the European Commission is considering an outright ban on tobacco advertising. A draft directive proposing the ban was approved by the Commis- sion earlier this year. This has since been the subject of fierce debate and will be discussed at a meeting of EC health minis ters in November. The UK's voluntary agree ment follows months of discus sion between the government and the tobacco industry, which spent about Â£80m on media advertising last year, as well as substantial sums on other forms of promotion such a sport sponsorship. As well as introducing tougher health warnings, the new agreement extends the ban on poster advertising visi ble from schools to include those visible from children's playgrounds. Similarly, it tightens con trols on tobacco advertising in young women's magazines and bans tobacco advertisements from new magazines for six months. It extends health warnings to branded advertising on companies' vehicles and retail pomotional material. The agreement was wel comed by the tobacco Indus try. The Tobacco Advisory Council, which represents the industry, described it as a \"victory for common sense\". Health groups, which are campaigning for the UK to support the EC's proposed total advertising ban, how ever, rejected the agrement Sinadequate. The government-appointed Health Education Authority deplored the rellance on what it termed \"Ilefective\" volun tary a -eements. Mr Michael O'Comnor, dire- to ofa the Coraeary Preventio Group, said the agreement was \"yet another shamefl chapter in the government' colsiuon with the tobacco inatr5\". The British Medical Aseos-i tion and other grous have warned that the crdiMdity a I leas, - a unud y Mr William Walegra health secretary, to raise Brt- lh bhealth stanards wil he dmiad unless the govern- mnt takes a t hler stanef tlbacoe adverhslag.",

   "text_content" : "For today at least, there will be more questions than answers about British Aerospace's prof- its warning; but the manner and timing of its announce- ment scarcely inspire confi- dence. Given that most fore- casts for. its full-year profits were cut by a fifth only a few weeks ago, it looks like a case of mutual misunderstanding between BAe and the City. Since the recession began appearing in the form of lower profits, companies have shown an uncanny ability to deliver results closely in line with expectations. BAe's tradition- ally aloof style is out of step with the times. One wonders nevertheless why the group felt obliged to make the warning when it did - tomorrow's interim results give it an opportunity for the customary trading statement. Perhaps the underwriters of its expected rights issue were edgy; or BAe's auditors were unhappy at continuing the pol- icy of putting the costs of its redundancy programme into the balance sheet. The episode .seems to sup- port Lord Weinstock's asser- tion that large defence groups are having to wave goodbye to the days when customer advances provided the funding for their businesses. In its 1990 accounts, BAe had some Â£4.5bn of advances, equivalent to three times its market capital- isation and Â£400m less than the previous year's figure. As cus- tomers get tougher, BAe might gear up with debt or issue lots more equity, but its working capital requirements will be as heavy as ever. The implica- tions for shareholders are less than pleasing whichever route it chooses. Their only consola- tion is that talk of a large acquisition now seems decid- edly far-fetched. Whatever the case, the price for not massaging expectations has already been a 6.5 per cent irop in BAe's shares. If there is a large charge against profits to be made from the likes of Rover or the Arlington prop- erty portfolio, the worst of the damage might be over. The 6.5 per cent yield is scant consola- tion for the risk of further dete- rioration at the trouble spots. Currencies Having failed to rise to a new peak in the aftermath of the Soviet coup, the dollar is looking jaded. Its sharp fall in Europe yesterday owed some thing to heavy commercial sales in a thin market in New York on Friday night. But with Wall Street treading water and long-dated US government FT-SE Index: 2,653.2 (-14.2) British Aerospace Shwe rice relative tothe FT-A Al-Share Index 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 bonds trading at yields below 8 per cent, the dollar offers little investment attraction. The balance of expectation is that the next Federal Reserve move will be to ease. There was no clear steer from last week's unemployment figures, but the Fed has a fresh oppor- tunity to assess domestic recovery when prices and retail sales data are released at the end of this week. The pros- pect that rates might then fall, however, does not mean that the foreign exchange market has become a one-way street. It has already discounted a US interest rate move; the Fed may not have much appetite for another. UK economy It is quite easy to imagine Mr Major pushing harder on the election button after yes- terday's revised retail sales and credit figures for July. It would be imprudent to con- clude, though, that the UK's economic statistics are yet con- sistent with anything more exciting than a slow and uncer- tain recovery. Two consecutive months of retail volume growth on a scale not seen since early 1989 is certainly encouraging. Indeed, if one reallocates to later months part of the large March increase attributed to VAT, an improving trend is discernible at the end of the first half. Year on year compar- isons should turn positive when August figures are avail- able. The argument is all very tentative, however; allowance has to be made for the impact of stock clearance sales over the summer, and too much should not be read into sub sector gainers and losers. Though clothing and footwear sales were static in July, the rise in purchases of more dis- cretionary household goods and consumer durables could conceivably be linked to the depressed housing market. Those deciding not to sell their homes can simultaneously opt for a spot of DIY. The July credit figures can also be read in more than one way. The Â£4.28bn of new lend- ing was more than the market expected and certainly adds weight to opinion poll findings that consumer confidence is creeping back. The size of credit card debt as a proportion of net increased lending, though, suggests that dis- tressed borrowers may be somewhere in the equation. Leucadia/ Molins Leucadia's long-drawn out effort to gain control of Molins lacks the profile of Lord Han- son's mooted bid for ICI, but it raises important issues of prin- ciple nonetheless. This week Molins must call an extraordi- nary meeting at which its board stands to be outvoted by a foreign predator which man- aged to acquire only 45 per cent in the course of its origi- nal bid two years ago. Leuca- dia's chances of success are high because it has since man- aged to raise its stake to 48.45 per cent by buying shares at a premium to the market price. There are aggrieved parties on almost every side in this affair, not least investors deprived of the right to exit at the premium paid by Leucadia since its its bid lapsed. Yet Leucadia has not infringed the Takeover Code; That suggests the Code is inadequate when a bid lapses with the bidder in spitting distance of a majority. Hard cases make bad law. It is not easy to see how the Code could be amended without gross interference in the work- ings of the market. forcing such a bidder to unwind its stake, possibly at a loss, would make the whole takeover busi- ness extraordinarily risky. In any case the Code defines a stake of between 30 and 50 per cent as effective control. By that yardstick, Molins is deny- ing Leucadia its democratic rights by refusing it represen- tation on its board. That situa- tion would persist even if Leu- cadia had been denied its right to increase its stake by the per- mitted 2 per cent a year after the bid lapsed. But other share holders also have a justifiable claim to equal treatment. Some of the injustice done to them would disappear if, having taken control of the Molins board, Leucadia was obliged to make an offer for the entire outstanding capital at the high- est price it paid along the way.",

BA cargo contract The Cargo Division of British Airwas, in conjunction with KLM, has embarked on a maor initiative to expand their business communim cations capability with their world-wide trading agents. lbrranti International Information Systems will supply a pilot system for implementation in the USA, designed to enable industry standard multi-functional PC and dial-in connectivity via the PSTN. This will provide links to consignment processing and tracking mainfram-es with a potential to service 2,000 agents across the US and wil form the basis of British Airwas expanding their world-wide cargoservces. Key to the success of the system is the 'PC connect' software package developed by ranti sorus with their 0 Gatsewa. This package has been extended to address the need for remote PCs to maintain full IBM mainframe sessions oer traditionally variable perfor- mance media such as dial-in PSTN lines and radio-data links, yet present uninter- rupted on-line access to the user. By providing a standard software interface, the IT2000 has enabled British Airways to use their CARAT PC-based application to allo- user-friendly access to their mainframe systems. British Airways feels that this enhanced system offers considerable advantages to them and their trading partners such as immediate availability of lines, a usage- related cost structure and the ability to offer their services to a wider client base. British Airways and Ferranti International have been workng together o this pilot systemfor over 12 months and both parties feel that the enhanced coniectivity will deliver cost and efficiency benefits to both British Airways and their Cargo agents.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay BABCOCK PREBON, the troubled financial services group, has been placed in receiv- ership by its bankers, Samuel Montagu, but not before the main trading businesses were sold to management. The banks, which are owed 0m, called in receivers Cork Gully late on Friday after Ba-. cock Prebon failed to persuade creditors to back a rescue plan. The appointment of Cork Gully ends a troubled period which has seen the former York Trust money brokers trans- formed from a USM hot stock into little more than a penny share. The board said its sinan- cial viability had been preju- diced by the level of debt and substantial rental commitments on four properties it vacated last year to move into new offices in London's Broadgate. The sale of most of the com- pany to management has proba- bly secured the future of the 3abcock Prebon's 1,200 employ- ees in eight countries. However, the speed at which the old man- agement appears to have shed its most onerous obligations and resumed business has raised some eyebrows. Mr Ian Bond, the receiver appointed from Cork Gully, said he had moved quickly over the weekend to sell the operating companies in order to secure the value of the group, whose main asset was its broking staff. Neither Cork Gully nor the new management would reveal how much it paid the receivers in the deal concluded at 4am on Sunday morning. Mr Bond said he did not expect the banks would be repaid in full nor would there be any assets for distribution to shareholders. Samuel Montagu is one of a number of banks financing the new entity to be headed by Mr Arthur Hughes, a substantia shareholder of Babcock Prebon and its former chief executive. The businesses in the sale include Babcock Fulton Prebon International, the financial futures business of Babcock Ful ton Prebon, the lease packaging and project finance business of Babcock & Brown and the US pension funds consultancy. Babcock Prebon has been try ing to broker a rescue with its bankers, shareholders and prop erty companies for a number of months. In August the company announced losses of Â£8.5m in the first six months, after losses of -30m in the previous 18 months. A Babcock Prebon spokesman said a combination of high debt, recession and its rental obliga- tions lay behind its demise. Details, Page 18",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller SUTER, the industrial holding company which has been operat- ing the adow oDepartment of Trade and Industry nquiries for more than three years, sus- fered a 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Â£9.2m in the first hil of the year. However, it reported signs of an upturn in parts of the group and the share price gained 0lp to close at 133p, compared with the January low of 8p. Suter's pre-tax decline, from Â£17m, represented an improve- ment on the second half of last year. Turnover of Â£104.7m (Â£102A.) was helped by acqusi- tions. r David Abell, chairman and chief executive, said that leaving those aside, sales were 5 per cent down. However, he felt that the bot- tom of the recession had been reached. Bidence of an upturn was showing through in chemi- cals, where there were additional inquiries in the contract busi- ness; in valves, where both orders and production were run- ning at record levels; and in hair care, \"which we would expect to be the first to pick up because it's nearest to the high street\" Reigeration had proved reces- ion resistant along with the food industry which it served. But some activities, such as supplying air conditioning equip ment, were still suffering and WDS a maker and distributor of standard parts for engineering equipment, was still getting worse. There was some confusion over the state of two DTI inquiries nto share dealings in six comp- anes with which Suter has been linked in the past. Mr Tony Paton Walsh, com- pany secretary, aid he ad been told about a month ago by the eetary to the inspectors that they had finshed their work and the report had been submitted. But the DTI said the investiga- tions were still going on and the report had not been received. It was not uncommon for the pro -m to take more than two years and this was a complex case because of the number of compa- nis involved. The investigation, under sec- lion 442 of the Companies Act, is into the former share ownenhip t James Nell Hod Francis industries, FH oyd Holdings, Mosey Docks and Harour Com- any, Metal Closures Group and inchmore.

   "text_content" : "By Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent he underlying problems -t British Aerospace appear to have caught up with the company faster than expec- ted. The company's warning yester- day of far lower than expected profits this year surprised the stock market and sent BAe's share price tumbling. The City was baffled by the timing of the warning only two days before BAe was due to release its results for the first half of this year. There was spec- ulation that this would coincide with a much talked about rights issue. BAe shares dropped 37p to 518p after the company said its board \"wishes to state that its own expectations are well below the numbers mentioned in the week- end press\". These forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about Â£00m compared with Â£376m last year. Various theories were doing the rounds in the City over the reasons for the sudden bearish announcement, including the possibility of some unexpected heavy write-ofs. The London Stock Exchange is also understood to have been investigating dealings in BAe shares before yesterday's state- ment because of speculation over what appears to be a well-leaked imminent rights issue. It is con- tinuing to monitor the situation. The favourite explanation for BAe's decision to put out a profit warning was that there had been a mismanaged flow of informa- tion to the market in expectation of a rights issue to raise Â£450m to Â£500m. If the rights issue was to go ahead successfully - and the City was suggesting yesterday that the odds were still in favour of a rights announcement later this week - the company clearly had to ensure that the market would not be taken by surprise by its financial performance this year. When Professor Sir Roland Smith, BAe's chairman, reported in February record 1990 pre-tax profits of Â£376m, he also warned that the company was continuing to face pressures from high infla- tion, high interest rates, the weak dollar, not to mention the cuts in the defence industry. Although the company would be forced to continue rationalis- ing production capacity and shed- ding jobs, he expressed confi- dence in the company's long-term future. Since February, the short-term outlook for the company has deteriorated more rapidly than expected. The defence business - accounting for about 80 per cent of the company's trading profits last year - is facing a steady long-term decline. So far, the Saudi Arabian Al Yamamah contract has not trans- lated into more military aircraft orders. Serious doubts are facing sev- eral of the missiles division's main projects because of govern- ment defence cuts. At a time of rare defence con- tracts, BAe last week lost out to 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 400 Em -200 1981 1982 1 8.5 Percent Dividend yi 7.5 UI iON 9IO 1991 SOL= Odubum 3.5 1981 83 85 87 81 Sir Roland Smith Â·_ IBM for the contract to project- manage the new Anglo-Italian EH101 anti-submarine helicopter programme. Elsewhere, the commercial aerospace business is under intense pressure because of the difficulties of the airline indus- try. Although the Airbus pro- gramme, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake, has good long-term prospects, BAe's regional and business aircraft activities are facing difficult times. At the same time, the company will have to start repaying next year some of the government launch aid it received for Airbus programmes. The Rover car group has been affected by the deep recession in the UK car market, which has fallen with far greater severity than anyone ever expected. So far, there are no signs of a recovery in the market while Rover's production and develop- ment costs remain high. The car group will show a loss in the first half of this year and some ana- lysts expect an operating loss for Rover of f80m to Â£100m for the full year. Nor have BAe's prop- erty and construction activities escaped the general property slump. Cars, property and commercial aircraft are the three principal prongs of BAe's diversification strategy to reduce the company's heavy reliance on the military business. While the military business has been slipping away, the gen- eral trend in the group's civil business has been discouraging so far this year. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aero- space analyst at Shearson Leh- man Brothers, said: \"I had expec- ted the bad times to hit them next year. They have come ear- lier than expected.\" BAe would have to continue investing heavily to diversify to offset the decline in the defence sector. The bottom line, however, is the heavy capital requirement of diversification. BAe's capital expenditure totalled Â£834m last year and was Â£860m the year before. To transform the company into a diversified industrial group it will be forced to continue spend- ing both to rationalise existing production and expand into new sectors. Diversifying into the civil sector provides none of the hidden benefits of the military business where most research and development costs are covered by government con- tracts. Mr Hodgkinson estimated that every Â£1 of profit BAe has to replace from declining military business with civil alternatives costs the company Â£10. This is one of the reasons the company has been anxious to increase its capital. In the current environment, it is difficult to see how it can gen- erate internally the level of funds required to support its continu- ing diversification programme. Although at the end of last year, BAe showed net liquid assets of Â£711m, this included hefty customer advances largely from Saudi Arabia on defence orders. Excluding these advances, net debt totalled around Â£800m giv- ing a debt-equity ratio of 31 per cent. Net debt is expected to have continued to rise this year. BAe has long regarded its capi- tal base in relation to its annual sales of Â£10.5bn last year as too small. With the need to raise cash to continue its diversifica- tion programme, the company was expected to make a call on the market at some stage during the next 12 months. Recent City speculation sug- gests it has decided to do so this week, although after yesterday's profit warning it could decide after all to postpone the announcement of the widely expected rights issue. Nobody disputes the logic of a cash call. They are baffled, to say the least however, by its orches- tration. Lex, Page 16"

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy MR RALPH INGERSOLL, the US publisher who owns the Bir- mingham Post and Mail regional newspaper group, is negotiating a re-capitalisation deal with major publishers in Italy, Ger- many and France. Mr Ingersoll, the first Ameri- can to make a significant invest- ment in the British regional press, wants to sell a large minority stake to a single conti- nental European or a group of publishers. The US publisher insists he wants to keep a majority stake in the newspaper group in spite of the impression that the whole group is for sale. Two separate management groups are also competing to take over the company but it is likely that a management buyout will only succeed if efforts to find a continental European minority shareholder fail. Mr Ingersoll, who owns the Birmingham Post, Evening Mail, Sunday Mercury, Coventry Even- ing Telegraph and 50 per cent of Irish Press Newspapers, has signed a non-binding letter of intent with one management buyout group. This is led by the chairman of Ingersoll Publications, Sir Gor- don Brunton, and chief executive Mr James Plugh. They are work- ing with merchant banks Mont- agu Midland and Charterhouse to raise a purchase price believed to value the UK businesses at around Â£150m. Under this option Mr Ingersoll would retain a significant minor- ity slice of the company. A second, \"unofficial\" manage- ment buyout group brings together six leading editorial and financial executives on the newspapers, including Mr Chris Oakley, the Birmingham Post and Mail managing director and editor-in-chief. The group is offering more than Â£120m for the UK busi- nesses and has the backing of Candover, the venture capital group for the equity investment. Two high street banks are under- writing the debt. Mr Ingersoll clearly hopes to end the uncertainty and either re-capitalise or find a buyer for his group before the end of this year. In the past there has been interest from a number of news- paper groups including Mr Con- rad Black's Daily Telegraph and EMAP, the regional newspaper and magazine company. Mr Ingersoll needs to raise money to reduce debt, partly taken on to pay for new presses. In the past he expanded his busi- ness by taking on high interest innk bonds.",

CAVERDALE GROUP PLC INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 1991 CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT The Company has successfully completed its refinancing announced in June 1991 with existing shareholders taking up nearly 50% of the Rights Issue shares offered to them and the balance being taken up by the sub underwriters comprising Directors, ex- Directors and New Investors. It was announced today that the Company had sold its subsidiary Kingston Cutting Tools Limited (KCT') for a consideration of Â£24,000. Prior to completion Â£425,000 of intercompany debt owing by KCT was repaid. This, together with the elimination of KCTs overdraft has improved the Group's net cash position by approximately Â£530,000. As a result the Group has nil net bank borrowings and is thus well poised to take advantage of any upturn in the economy as well as any acquisition opportunities which might arise. For the first six months of 19911 am pleased to announce a significant reduction in trading losses to Â£85,000 (1990: Â£88,000) and to report that all the continuing operations are now trading profitably. Pretax profits of 247,000 (1990: Â£298,000 loss) are struck after an exceptional credit of Â£332,000. As part of the strategy to strengthen the Groups capital base and due to the deficiency on the Profit and Loss account, the Board is not able to recommend the payment of an interim dividend. The exceptional items comprise a further provision of Â£43,000 for the claim made by Mr Lakmaker against the Company following a Court judgement, and a profit of Â£375,000 in respect of realisation of assets purchased out of receivership by Allied Components (UK) Limited.

   "text_content" : "CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, yes- terday announced plans for the raising of a new fund, capital- Ised at between Â£30m and Â£60m, to invest in smaller buy- outs - those valued at less than Â£5m, writes Charles Bat- chelor. The new fund, to which investors have already commit- ted Â£23m, confirms the shift in the buy-out industry to smaller deals and is intended to replace a Â£30m fund established four years ago which is nearly fully invested. The announcement of the new fund-raising accompanied Candover's interim results which showed slight rises in both profits and assets in the six months to June 30. Pre-tax profits rose to Â£2.17m, against Â£2.07m, while earnings per share increased to 6.69p (6.37p). Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said he expected profits for the year to exceed 1990's Â£3.7m. The interim dividend goes up from 3p to 3.5p. Net assets grew to Â£52m (Â£51.6m), while assets per share rose by Ip to 233p. The modest increase in prof- its in the first half was due, paradoxically, to the level of investment activity. Buy-out investments produce little return in the early stages but mean the company has to withdraw funds from high yielding deposits and treasury bills. Candover made four new investments in the half-year, the largest of which was the Â£34m buy-out of Blue Arrow Personnel Services.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE SEVERITY of the recession in the UK housing market was again illustrated yesterday when Wilson (Con nolly) Holdings, the east of England-based builder, announced a 28 per cent fall to 213.8m in pre-tax profits during the first six months of this year. The company has one of the largest land-banks of any of the quality housebuilders. Much of this land was acquired well before prices peaked dur- ing the late 1980s. As a result margins have held up better than most of its rivals. Net margins on house sales during the first half, although lower than last time, were still 17 per cent. The number of house sales increased from 1,087 to 1,300 - a gain approaching 20 per cent. Even so, housing profits fell from Â£14.9m to Â£12.4m. Profits from property development fell sharply from Â£2.97m to just Â£42,000. Contracting profits, however, only eased from 21.47m to Â£1.34m. Overall turnover rose lightly to Â£99.9m :compared with Â£96.5m. Earnings per share slid from 7D to 5.1p, but the interim divi dend is increased from 1.21p to 1.27p. In preparation for the next upturn in the market, the comn pany has begun to increase its purchases of housing land. It owned 14,300 plots with plan ning permission at the end of June compared with 13,500 at the beginning of the year and a peak of 15,400 at the end of 1989. Mr Ian Black, managing director, said the balance sheet remained strong. Gearing, even after allowing for deferred pay- ment on land purchases, would be only 17 per cent, he said. 9 COMMENT Results from Wilson (Con- nolly), along with Persimnon and Wilson Bowden which announced their interims last week, are likely to be the pick of the crop of the house builders' results season. They have long landbanks and strong balance sheets in common, a combination whic- serves equally well in reces sion or in recovery. Wilson (Connolly) quite rightly is taking advantage of cheaper land prices to position itself for the upturn when it comes. Higher sales volume should push housing profits higher in the second half but property and contracting will remain difficult. Full-year profits, assuming and provisions are not repeated, could be about Â£28m compared with Â£31m last time. There are cheaper housing recovery stocks around but Wilson (Connolly) is a quality stock and is worth its premium rating as a long term buy."

   "text_content" : "By Michlyo Nakamoto A WEAK economic climate coupled with pressure on mar- gins saw interim profits at British Vita, the Manchester- based polymer fibre and foam group, fall 11 per cent from Â£27.3m to Â£24.2m pre-tax. The lower outcome for the six months to. June 30 came despite an 8 per cent rise in turnover to Â£349.8m (Â£324.1m). The group suffered as a result of the adverse effects that higher raw material costs, triggered by events in the Gulf, had on margins across the board. Meanwhile, the sluggishness of European economies, partic- ularly the UK and Spain, took its toll. France saw a difficult first quarter for its automotive industry. Two thirds of operations are based in continental Europe, with the balance in the UK. The pre-tax contribution from the UK fell to Â£7.13m (Â£9.03m) while that from Europe was down to Â£14.9m (Â£15.9m). Two factories acquired in Germany and a business pur- chased in the Netherlands made contributions which just about covered financing costs, said Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive. A foam business acquired in the US will start contributing in the second half. Despite these acquisitions, gearing has been maintained at the \"rock solid and comfort- able range\" of 20 per cent, Mr Sellers said. The interest charge, how- ever, rose to Â£2.4m (Â£1.56m) Earnings per share declined to 8p (9.5p) but the interim dividend is increased to 3.45p (3.3p). * COMMENT The slight downturn in profits hardly damaged enthusiasm for Vita while its achieve- ments over the period did much to bolster its reputation of being a well-managed group. Despite its exposure to two markets that have been badly hit - furniture and vehicles - it has made three acquisitions that have not sig- nificantly eroded its gearing and maintained capital invest- ment at near last year's level. What's more Vita has shown itself to be remarkably adep at taking advantage of te downturn. It instigated a price. war, which forced many of its weaker UK competitors out of business and left it with a larger slice of the market. Forecasts of Â£50m for the full year for a multiple of 14, puts the shares on a slight pre- mium to the market. But given the strength it has built up amid the shake-out and its exposure to two sectors with substantial room for recovery, depending on the strength and timing of a UK consumer recovery, its prospects look fairly good in the short term.",

   "text_content" : "ABCOCK Prebon, which went into receivership this weekend, was a casualty of London's appalling property market as much as the demise of its main busi- ness, money broking, and its high level of debt. Too many lease obligations after an ambitious move into glitzy new premises at Lon- don's Broadgate triggered the group's collapse. But the purchase by manage- ment of the operating compa- nies from the receivers again raises the hoary question of whether shareholders and creditors get a fair deal in man- agement buy-outs. Babcock Prebon was always going to face a difficult task conjuring up a rescue after announcing in August that it was in discussion with its bankers. It had incurred an overall loss of Â£30m in the 18 months to last September and a Â£8.5m loss in the following six months. It was facing bills of Â£4m for preference dividends, Â£6m in interest on its Â£50m debt line to banks led by Sam- uel Montagu and it had to meet lease payments for four proper- ties it vacated in order to move to Broadgate. The company had hoped to persuade landlords on the vacated properties to allow the company leeway in meeting its payments. A rescue might then still have been possible. However last Friday, follow- ing the failure to ease its lease payments and a further quar terly rent bill looming, the banks decided to call in Cork Gully, the receivers Some shareholders might be tempted to view the deal that emerged at 4am on Sunday morning a rather too cozy. Mr Ian Bond, Cork Gully deputy chairman, sold all the operat ing companies to management led by Mr Arthur Hughes, the chief executive of both Bab- cock Prebon and the new as yet-unnamed entity. This team walks away with the operating companies virtu ally in tact. The crippling lease obligations and at least half the Â£50m debt remain for credi tors to worry - there are almost no assets left in the receiver's hands. The banks, which also include Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Mid land, are unlikely to be repaid all the Â£50m they leant, Mr Bond says. Nor are sharehold ers likely to see their money again. W hen the shares were suspended they stood at 2%p, capitalising the group at Â£6.17m, down from 167p in 1987. Cork Gully and Babcock Pre bon's previous management would not reveal the price the buy-out tepm paid, although it is understood to have been in excess of Â£25m. Nor will Mr Hughes reveal how much finance his bankers, including Samuel Montagu, provided in order to launch the now private company. It is cer- tain though that having learnt that too much debt tears a money broking business apart, bankers would only have -acked the new company if the level of debt was not too oner- 0us. Mr Bond agreed that the deal he brokered may look cozy to the outside world. \"I hate sell- ing to management,\" he said \"But from Friday afternoon I tested the market and decided no outsider would come in and that from Monday morning I would be left with an asset that was shrinking minute by minute.\" As a people business, the assets would have walked out of the door, Mr Bond said. The company had between Â£Sm an. 10m of capital but Â£49m of goodwill in the balance sheet. The receivers would also have been aware that adminis trators for British & Common- wealth have failed either to foat or sell Exco and that the recession has caused problems for other money brokers. Mr Patrick Keenan, an in-house corporate adviser to Babcock Prebon, also defended the hastily agreed deal. He said that 47 per cent of the shares were held by directors, ex-di- rectors and the company's employees. Apart from about Â£2m in lease obligations, the buy-out team has also taken almost all the group's obligations with it and responsibility for 1,200 staff in eight countries and the mom running costs. He also stressed that when Babcock Prebon bid for Inter- national City Holdings, a money and foreign exchange broker, in 1989, Mr Hughes, who owned 5 per cent of the company, put up Â£12m in the accompanying 20m placing. Mr Jim Babcock put up Â£12m, some of it through Babcock and Brown Inc, which owns 23 per cent of Babcock Prebon. In retrospect, the ICH acqui- ition was the turning point for Babcock Prebon, then called York Trust. ICH turned out to have more debt than expected and partly as a result it took six months to conclude the agreed bid. n addition ICH had an obli- gation to move into Broau- gate offices. Rather than buy out of the new Broadgate lease, York decided to bring together its now expanded staff and move out of its existing four buildings. It took considerably more cash than expected to refit and move to the new offices and in the meantime the property market started to collapse. \"In retrospect it was wrong to continue with the new lease as the property market fell apart,\" said Mr Keenan. As the receivers moved into gear yesterday, Babcock Pre- bon's bankers and sharehold- ers no doubt thought some of their other moves could have been better timed.",

   "text_content" : "By June Fuller EVANS HALSHAW, the motor trader, saw pre-tax profit fall by 27 per cent to Â£1.87m in the first half of 1991 as very little money was made on new cars. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said August car sales had been good for volume, but thin on margin because the makers had offered discounts direct to customers. He said there was little evi- dence of increasing activity this year, but because of pent-up demand he was confi- dent for 1992. Deferred spending was illus- trated in yesterday's announce- ment from Suter, the industrial holding company, which had saved Â£1.5m by delaying the replacement of company cars and vans. Evans's interim decline was from Â£2.56m, itself a fall from Â£4.2m in the first half of 1989. Worst hit were commercial vehicles and luxury cars - limiting the gains from two Mercedes-Benz and Porsche dealerships bought late last year. Profit on the speciality car side was down 40 per cent. Turnover fell from Â£206.6m to Â£173.2m. Mr Dale said the Moprod-Supra parts distribu- tion business sold a year ago had contributed Â£17m to first- half sales. The Â£12m obtained for it had helped reduce inter- est charges to Â£1.7m (Â£3.1m), improving interest cover even though trading profit fell to Â£3.57m (Â£5.66m). On the volume car side, the Ford dealerships - comprising eight of the group's 39 - were 40 per cent down on profit. The others, including Rover, Vaux- hall, Peugeot and Toyota, were comparable with the previous year. Repairs and servicing, which accounted for 60 per cent of profit last year, moved up to 73 per cent in the first half. Used car sales were also ahead. Net debt remained at the year-end level of Â£13m, gearing of about 35 per cent, all related to the contract hire fleet. Earnings per share fell to 5.6p (7.7p). The interim divi- dend is maintained at 3.6p.",

   "text_content" : "Bya.June Fuller SUTER, the industrial holding company, .hellits interim dividend at 3.2p in spite of a 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profit from Â£17m to Â£9.2m, in the half-year to June 29. It also forecast a final dividend of 5.6p to keep the total at 8.8p. Trading profit fell 34 per cent to Â£12.4m (Â£18.9m). The worst performance came from chemicals, which slumped to Â£3.3m (Â£6.7m) in spite of a six-month contribu- tion from Chemoxy International, which was only in for half the corresponding period. Pentagon Chemicals had lost money after losing a big contract, and Mitchell Cotts fine chemicals suffered a big setback in sales. Suter said the latter had picked up strongly since June. This left the industrial group - making motor components, refrigeration equip ment and valves - as the biggest profit earner with Â£5.5m (Â£5.9m). The distribu- tion arm of the business inched ahead to 03.3m (Â£3.2m). Gearing of 79 per cent, on net debt of Â£41m, was slightly up on the year-end. Interest costs rose to Â£2.8m (Â£1.9m) follow- ing acquisitions for cash. Earnings per share fell from 10.6p to 5.4p. SCOMMENT If Suter were a normal company, it could have a rights issue to strengthen its bal- ance sheet and start using its shares again to make acquisitions. The long-winded DTI inquiry seems to have shut off these routes. Indeed, when Suter did have some spare cash, one of the ways it spent it was to buy its own shares, presumably to give some support to the price, as it has also had to do via a generous dividend policy. Even after yesterday's price rise to 133p, the prospective yield is nearly 9 per cent. Whatever the professed comfort on inter- est cover, debt is rising this year - albeit on capital spending slightly ahead at Â£9.5m - and it may go up again next year as the vaunted upturn sucks in more working capital. A pre-tax profit forecast of Â£19m gives a prospective p/e of 12. If it were a normal company it would be worth buying; the DTI factor makes it no more than a hold.",

The Bio-Activities segment remained virtually stable. The Perfumes and Beauty Products segment, despite the Gulf War, nearly broke even at the operating margin level, but it must be remembered that this sector generates the bulk of its profit in the second half of the year. Sustained management efforts, marked by the stabilisation of operating expenses, also contributed to this improvement. The stable operating results of companies consolidated by the equity method do not take into account the good performances of Chinoin, a recently acquired Hungarian pharmaceutical company.

Mr Kingsbury said he wcs confident of keep- ing his pr mise to investors to increase the dividend each year. ! Electronics and electrical power pr duced increased prof- its of Â£3. 8m (Â£3.38m) buoyed by strong margins in its in- sulator add US Red Lion busi- ness. While the aerospace and defence division produced static lrofits of Â£1.05m (Â£1.01m), iltration and speci- alised ceramics reported a reduced contribution of Â£1.51m (Â£2.05m). The grdup has net cash of Â£9.8m. Tle relocation of the group's b siness to Avon, Staf- fordshire and the Netherlands will not affect the cash bal- ance. The moae, prompted by the government's decision last year to cancel the eighth batch of Tornadb aircraft - thereby affecting the aerospace busi- ness - is'being funded by the sale of the group's property in Heston, west London, for Â£9m. Earnings per share fell from 13.7p to 13.3p. * COMMENT Given the problems facing the engineering industry, static profits should be considered in a favourable light. Fairey's cash balance puts the group in a good position to take advan- tage of the eventual upturn in the economy. Mr Kingsbury believes the group will be well placed to make a further acqui- sition next year on the scale of LaserMike in the US, which was recently bought for $11.5m (Â£6.68m). The City expects full- year taxable profits of about Â£14m - the same as last year. That puts the shares, which yesterday rose 4p to close at 313p, on a multiple of 12, reflecting the company's abil- ity to make good profits in dif- ficult times.",

The pre-tax outcome of Â£2.44m com- pared with Â£3.04m in the same period of 1990. Earnings per share slipped to 5.26p against 6.5p. The interim dividend is held at 2p. The largest element in the profits reduc- tion was a bad debt of Â£380,000. The money, for printing ink, is owed by a company caught up in the collapse of International Leisure Group and has been written-off. But recession has left its mark in other ways. Nationally there has been a fall of 12 per cent in the printing inks business, but Mr Roy Amos, chairman, said the com- pany had increased its market share and did not suffer a reduction of business to that extent. However, the depression in the building industry and the downturn in the transport industry hurt sales of tiles and industrial coatings. On the plus side, Manders' property business, concentrated on an eponymous shopping centre in Wolverhampton, saw an 8.8 per cent increase in income to Â£2.11m as rent reviews continued to push up income. Falls in interest rates are beginning to work through into the figures with inter- est charges in the first half down to Â£2.14m compared with Â£2.31m. Business conditions in July and August were better than in the January-June period and Mr Amos said that \"the second half should be better than the first six months.\""

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollnger PROPERTY SALES helped cushion the fall at Goodhead Group, the printing, publishing and marketing services com- pany. Pre-tax profits declined from Â£4m to Â£768,000 over the year to May 31. An exceptional item of Â£660,000 - after losses on dis- continued activities - was due to the sale and leaseback of part of the group headquarters at Bicester, Oxfordshire. An extraordinary charge of 2.5m arose from the revaluing of titles and property, and closure and redundancy costs. Mr John Madesk chairman, said the group had achieved its principal alms of maing prof its and reducing indebtedness. Debt had fallen bv 21 ner cent to Â£10m following sales of prop- erties and businesses. Gearing was held at 69 per cent. Goodhead had \"strengthened the management team at all levels... and streamlined every division,\" he said. Three new directors were added to the board during the year, including the announce- ment yesterday of Mr Paul Hig- gins as executive director and head of the marketing services division. The group, which has been hard hit by recession in the advertising industry, last year embarked on a wide-ranging programme to cut overheads. Staff was reduced by 41 per cent to 604, the group with- drew from the US, and several unprofitable titles were closed. \"We have cut overheads by about 25 to 30 per cent,\" said Mr Colin Rosser, chief execu- tive. The printing business con- tinued to perform well, he said, while UK publishing - mostly free newspapers - was hardest hit. Turnover fell by 14 per cent to Â£67.4m. Losses per share were 0.7p compared to earnings of 15.3p last time. The final div- idend is passed (3.75p) making just .5p (5.5p) for the year. Mr Madejski said the first quarter had started well and benefits of the reorganisation were beginning to show through. \"I am confident that the worst is past,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox PERJIWS JFQQPS, the acquis- itive food manufacturer and distributor, lifted pre-tax prof- its by 47 per cent to Â£lO.m in the six months to end-June, on the back of strong growth in continental Europe and acqui- sitions in 1990. SThe profits, 70 per cent from the Netherlands and 85 per cent from continental Europe overall, were achieved on a 31 per cent rise in turnover to Â£123.7m (Â£94.2m). Excluding acquisitions and a Â£250,000 cur- rency translation cost, operat- tng.profits rose by 12 per cent. SThree meat and pancake acquisitions late in 1990 for an initial consideration totalling 20m, helped frozen food oper- ating profits double to Â£4.7m (Â£2.3m) and pushed margins to 15.2 per cent (11.8 per cent). Chilled foods profits were boosted to Â£1.5m (Â£300,000) by last year's purchase of Bakker, the Dutch food manufacturer, for Â£15m and by the increasing popularity of prepared meals. New supply contracts with the New Zealand and South African marketing boards helped push turnover in fruit and vegetables up by 14 per cent to Â£59.7m, strengthening market position, according to Mr Howard Phillips, chief exec- utive. However, profit rose by only 7 per cent to 2s.5m. Despite continuing competi- ti ew.

Earnings per share rose to 5.4p (4.4p) basic or .lp (4.1p) fully diluted and the interim diviend is increased to 1.7p (.5p). Mr Phillips said that the UK remained dull but that conti- nental demand should main- tain strong growth in the main products. * COMMENT A rare six months without acquijitions gives a better hiahce to judge last year's 4dals. The management target of rapid earnings enhancement seems 'to have been met, and Perkins has clearly found another goldmine on the conti- nent in Peppino's Pizza, rein- forcing the star frozen foods division.

If tax- able profits rise to Â£25m for the year, fully diluted earnings of 12p put it on a p/e of 14, falling to 12.7 in 1992. Hardly cheap, but compared with the uncer- tainty of UK recovery stories, a picture of continued strong European growth may look attractive.",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Hollinger BASS yesterday announced the sale of 372 Midlad-baed pubs, pushing the UK brewing and hotels group past the half- way stage in the restructuring of its estate to comply with government requirements. The sale marks the largest purchase by an independent non-brewer since the Monopo- lies and Mergers Commission required the leading UK brew- ers to begin reducing their pub estates in the autumn of 1989. Enterprise Inns, a newly- formed company headed by former Courage managing director and chairman of Taunton Cider, Mr Michael Cottrell, is believed to have paid in the region of Â£56m to Â£60m in cash for the pubs. Enterprise has also signed a separate five-year supply agreement with Bass. The deal will create a regional retailer about half the size of Wolver- hampton and Dudley, which has a turnover of Â£170m, said one analyst. Since July 1989, Bass has sold more than 1,430 of its 7,300 pubs to raise Â£240m. About 1,250 of these were sold in the current financial year for a gain of more than Â£205m. Analysts estimate that about between Â£20m and Â£30m of this will be taken above the line in this year's results, with the balance recorded as an extraordinary item. Mr Bob Cartwright, Bass public relations director, said yesterday that the company was very pleased with the price it had received for the pubs. The disposal programme was well and truly on target, he said, with the terms already agreed on the sale of 400 more pubs. The deal will leave Bass with about 2,000 pubs in the Midlands. Bass aims to reduce its estate to 4,580 pubs by the government deadline of Octo- ber 31, 1992. The deal was financed through a combination of equity, mezzanine, and debt, although the proportions were not revealed. ANZ arranged the financing, while County NatWest Ventures is leading an institutional equity syndi- cate and has put together the mezzanine funds.",

   "text_content" : "ALPHAMERIC, the maker of computer keyboard and epos systems, is planning a rights issue to complete its reorgani- sation and meet its target of returning to profits in 1992-93. Mr Alan Benjamin, chairman, said that about Â£5m was needed, writes Nigel Clark. An announcement is expec- ted in a few weeks. It was not known if it would be in time for the extraordinary meeting which would have to be held because net assets had fallen to less than half the called-lip share capital. The money is needed as working capital because the recession has resulted in a number of customers delaying placing orders. The company also announced a cut in annual losses to Â£2.91m (Â£11.6m) along with the sale of FTT Alpha- meric to British Telecommuni- cations for Â£1.85m cash. The sale of FTT, the dealing room systems business, will complete the disposals, raising more than Â£2.5m. In the year to March 31 the disposals left turnover down at Â£13.4m (Â£23.4m) for an operat- ing loss of Â£1.74m (Â£7.34m). Losses per share were 2.9p (20p). Mr Benjamin said that the group was broadly on line to achieve the objectives in the plan proposed when the new management took over in March last year. Losses at Arcadian increase to Â£3.68m Arcadian International, the lei- sure and property group which changed its name from West- minster & Country Properties at the time of its rights issue and merger with Smithfield Developments in November 1990, saw losses ncrease from Â£378,000 to Â£3.68m pre-tax in the year to April 30. The loss was reduced to 2.8m (Â£845,000) by a tax credit of Â£882,000 (charge Â£467,000) and was struck after provisions of Â£1.8m against commercial The Smithfield properties were sold for Â£5.5m before costs; Westminster's have so far accrued Â£5m. Properties with a book value of Â£5.4m remain to be sold Taking into account diposals made since the year-end, borrowings are down at Â£3.1m and gearing Is 3 per cent.

Earnings per share, on a notional tax rate, emerged at 2.4p per share. Hopkinsons declines to just above Â£3m A difficult first half for Hopkin- sons Group, with trading affected by the depth of the recession, saw pre-tax profits fall from Â£3.31m to Â£3.02m. Turnover from continuing operations of this industrial valve and oil hydraulic equip- ment maker declined from Â£21.2m to Â£18.7m. Mr Peter Frost, chairman, said the company had contin- ued to reduce costs and improve efficiency levels but had yet to experience any sus- tained improvement in demand. The programme of reorgani- sation, cost reduction and training at Bryan Donkin of Canada was progressing well, although it had some impact rwsr SaXw unucun urMs half for Hopkinsmas on performance in the first half. Operating profit from con- tinuing operations dropped to Â£1.72m (2.09m), while interest and other income added Â£13m (Â£15,000). Earnings per share slipped from 368p to 3.18p, but the interim dividend is main- tained at l.2p. Haynes breaks even in disappointng year Haynes Publishing Group, the car and motorcycle manual publisher, \"effectively broke even\" in the year to May 31, according to Mr John Haynes, chairman, reporting pre-tax profits down sharply from Â£.1m to Â£M,000.

Sherwood hit by Lloyd's worries Worries about the health of the Lloyd's insurance market cut pre-tax profits at Sherwood Computing Services from Â£850,000 to Â£575,000 in the first six months 'of this year. Operating profits improved by just over 10 per cent, from Â£883,000 to; Â£974,000, on turn- over little changed at Â£12.1m, but the company took an exceptional charge of Â£280,000 in view of potential losses from areas of the Lloyd's insurance market, one of the group's key markets. Mr Richard Guy, chief execu- tive, said the Lloyd's market had suffered from poor perfor- mance: \"There is a general lack of confidence and the con- tinuing strength of some of our traditional clients in this area is in doubt.\" he warned. Earnings per share were 6.6p (9.5p) but the interim dividend is held at 1.5p reflecting strong recurring revenue streams. CLF Yeoman agrees loan restructuring CLF Yeoman, the Irish leasing company, has agreed in princi- ple with its bankers on the restructuring of Â£39m in loans. It said it w4uld provide further details today after it had noti- fied the Stock Exchange. The company's shares were suspended last Friday after it said talks had broken down. The debt was incurred in 1988 when it booght CLF Holdings, a small ticket leasing company. It has since decided the acquired company was worth- less. Exceptibnals put Caverdale in black A exceptional profit of Â£375,000 on the realisation of assets Dought out of receivership by a subsidiary enabled Caverdale Group, the industrial and motor parts distributor, to report interim pre-tax profits of 247,000 (298,000 losses).

   "text_content" : "T HE BEST bed-tme sto- ries have happy end- ings, preferablywrris. Ing one. SietnighSt odings, Europe's bigest manuacturer of beds, certainly wrong-footed the market earlier this summer when it reported record annual poftits of Â£11.5m. The speed of last year's trad- ing recovery seem finally to close the chapter on Silent- night's disastrous tie-up with Lowndes Queensway, the fur- niture and carpet retailer, which cost the beds group sev- eral million pounds in 1980. The value of Silentnight's shares has more than doubled this year following confirma- tion that profits have bounced back rapidly at the family-con- trolled company, which is based in Lancashire. The aim of Silentnight's link-up with the now-defunct retail chain was ambitious: by directly delivering its beds to the homes of Lowndes Queen- sway customers, Silentnight aimed to cut the long periods customers have to wait for goods, one of the main weak- nesses of the furniture indus- try. The beds group had extended its deliveries to all parts of the country when Lowndes Queen- sway shares were suspended in August 1969, pending refinanc- ing. Silentnight had severed its connection before the retail group finally went under last summer, but the associated losses helped cut Silentnight's 1989 pre-tax profits from Â£11.lm to Â£7.39m. The link with Lowndes Queensway was the brainchild of Mr Christopher Burnett, then Silentnight's chief execu- tive. He still defends the logic of the move, and points out that Sentnight did not know anytg of the retailer's sinan- dal ties at the time of the initial deal - and, judging by the Lowndes Queensway share price, neither did anyone else. Ironically, Mr Burnett joined Silentnight in 1985, just after the company became involved in what was to become one of the longest and bitterest indus- trial disputes of the 1980s. After the dispute, the founder of Silentnight, Mr Tom Clarke - dubbed \"Mr Wonderful\" by Mrs Margaret Thatcher for his business enterprise - admitted that management had lost touch with the workforce. Mr Burnett helped put the company's profits on to a strong growth track - until the Lowndes Queensway fiasco. The company responded to the crisis by changing manage- ment and refocusing the busi- ness. This was achieved last year by selling the upholstery division for Â£9m to a manage- ment buy-out led by Mr Bur- nett. Both Mr Burnett and Silent- night insist that he did not leave directly because of the Lowndes Queensway affair. Mr Burnett says that the recovery in profits was already clear when he agreed to leave last summer. Because the family did not want to make any more acquisitions, or increase bor- rowings, he felt there was nothing more he could do for the company in the short term. There is no doubt, however, Silentnlght Holdings -.6a4Â» . u to -r Share arie (oence) 1987 1988 1989 1 200 0 n31st 20 that the Clarke family, which owns 52 per cent of the shares, has tightened its grip on the company. Mt Bill Davies, exec- utive chairian of Silentnight, is also chief executive of Famco, holding company for the Clarke family trust. Mr John Clarkej son of the retired founder, hts returned to an executive pdsition in charge of the beds division. But Mr Davies insists that recent changes are part of a much more;fundamental reap- praisal of the group's manage- ment and strategy. All the directors responsible for oper- ating divisions have for the first time been brought on to the main board. Mr Davies says: \"It does feel like a change in management, because there has been a change in direc- tion.\" The main strategic shift has been to refocus the group on beds and ckbinets. Mr Davies said the disposal of the uphol- stery divisi6n was in line with this, since upholstery had always yielded lower profits margins. Silentnight claims about 35 per cent of the UK beds mar- ket, with its four brands - Sealy, Silentnight, Layezee and Perfecta - covering the mar- ket from premium to budget level. Mr Davies says there is probably not much room for volume growth in the UK, but believes there is considerable scope for increasing the group's already high profit margins. Last year the group enjoyed a return on capital employed of 35.2 per cent. Silentnight, which is sitting on Â£13m cash, sees scope for margin improvement by increasing the efficiency with which it produces components, which had been manufactured separately at each plant. It has already centralised production of most of its bed springs and may rationalise the production of timber. However, the bulk of the Â£10m of capital expenditure which Silentnight will invest in the current year will go on cabinets, the division which the group has identified as its best hope for growth. Last year Homeworthy Fur- niture - the group's largest volume producer of cabinets, aimed at the middle market - increased its sales by a remark- able 39 per cent to Â£26.4m. Mr Davies says this has only been possible because of investment in more sophisticated plant. On the acquisitions front, Silentnight might be tempted if one of the lucrative US fran- chises for bed manufacturing came up for sale, but only if the price is right. Such territo- ries are restricted by licences issued by the owners of the patents to bedspring technol- ogy. Mr Davies is also considering expanding in Europe on the bedding side, but says the man- agement team's lack of lan- guage skills means it would have to purchase an estab- lished company. The new-look board does not seem at all traumatised by the Lowndes Queensway experi- ence, even although Mr Davies now accepts that Silentnight was too small to try to solve the inadequacies of the furni- ture industry's distribution system. Silentnight may no longer be trying to slay such dragons single-handedly, but the new focus on squeezing more prof- its out of beds and investing heavily in the lucrative niche of cabinets does means that shareholders can sleep more easily.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper and Jack Burton COMMERCIAL UNION, the composite insurer, faces losses of up to Â£5m following the bankruptcy of Njord, a small Swedish insurer in which it had a 38 per cent stake. Njord, the first Swedish insurer to go into liquidation since 1913, folded last Wednes- day. The company, which con- ducted a range of general insurance business, was unable to meet an insurance claim of over SKr712m (Â£66.5m) on a credit insurance policy which had been taken out by two Swedish lenders, the Swedish Post Office and Sparbanken Kronen. Barkman, the property group, defaulted on the loan. CU acquired a 9.9 per cent stake in Njord in March last year and increased its holding to 38.3 per cent six months later. However, earlier this year it decided to sell its stake. The lenders were willing to negotiate a deal that would have saved Njord, but CU as well as two other shareholders including the Arab Insurance Group, which owned 18.1 per cent, refused to inject more capital. The Swedish authorities have launched an investigatior into the circumstances of the failure. It is understood that management problems were centred in the bond and guar- antee department and that Njord failed to obtain reinsur- ance protection for obligations which were vastly in excess of its share capital of about SKr0OOm. -gal action against Njord' management is likely."

A senior official of the Treu- hand privatisation agency in Frankfurt an der Oder, the nearest regional office, con- firmed yesterday that Krupp was the frontrunner to acquire the bankrupt steel company, which employs about 9,000 people. There is also a joint offer from Thyssen and Salzgitter, now part of the Preussag group, and from the Dutch group Hoogovens. Krupp is reported to have the most ambitious restructuring plan for the east German steel group but is also demanding considerable state support. * BEKAERT, Belgium's lead- ing steel wire and cord pro- ducer, said the outlook for the rest of the year remained diffi- cult despite reporting higher than forecast first-half profits, Reuter reports. Net profit in the first half of 1991 fell sharply to BFr173m ($4.8m) against BFr413m in the first half of 1990."

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels A BELGIAN court yesterday accepted Trans European Air- ways' request for protection from its creditors and appointed two judges to report on the prospects for restructur- ing the airline. TEA, Belgium's largest inde- pendent airline, asked for pro- tection for four group compa- nies on Friday after a number of small creditors threatened to go directly to TEA's clients for repayment of their debts. The court decision - equiva- lent to Chapter 11 protection in the US - will enable TEA to continue flying while a restructuring package is put together. The airline, which has made losses for the past two years, was planning a number of mea- sures to revive the company, including possible investment or takeover by another airline. TEA said on Friday it that hoped to pay its small creditors BFr250,000 ($7,000) each within six months.",

   "text_content" : "By William Damkins in Paris HACHETTE, the French publishing and broadcasting group, is selling Danel Ferry, the country's leading printer of continuous office stationery, the first significant step in the FFr2bn (330m) programme of asset sales announced last June. The sale, at a price yet to be finalised, is to Apax Partners, the investment group formerly known as MMG Patricof. Danel Ferry is valued on the stock market at FFr230m. The sale price could be between FFr400m and FFrS00m given that the share price is affected by the fact that Hachette and its interests control nearly all Danel Ferry's capital, said Mr Jean Jacques Limage, analyst at DLP James Capel in Paris. Apax plans to finance acqui- sitions of other office statio- nery printers by Danel Ferry, the third largest player on a European market which remains fragmented and ripe for consolidation, said Mr Mau- rice Tchdnio, managing part- ner in the investment group. Hachette is selling assets to curb debts, which reached around FFr7.4bn by the end of last year due to the cost of a two-year US acquisition spree, including Groller, the encyclo- paedia group, for $449m and Diamandis, the magazine pub- lisher, for $712m. It also faces greater-than-expected losses and demands for cash from la Cinq, the troubled private tele- vision station of which Hach- ette became operator after tak- ing a 25 per cent stake last October. Danel Ferry is 86 per cent owned by Hachette, with another 11. per cent in the hands of Banque Arjil, the investment bank controlled by Ir Jean-Luc LagW dre, Hac ette's chairman..

   "text_content" : "k R FRANK Carrubba is vorfbn the chalt Sbat e hes tcsc s the newly-a pointed executive ovicpsdt f technology at PhilipS, the Dutch electronics giant. As he c ur p boas of pronail t m= his office in Silicon Valley last week, Mr Carrubba talked enthusiastically about the task ahead and his \"10 exciting year at Hewlett-Pckrd\" the US computer and electronics manfaacturer. As director of HP Laborato- ries since 1987, Mr Carrubba has managed HP's central research laboratories, with facilities In California and in Bristol, England. He Joined HP in 19M after 22 years as a mem- ber of the technical staff at IBM's research laboratory. By all accounts, Philips has engaged a remarkably gifted veteran of the US computer industry to direct the restruct- uring of its research and devel- opment efforts. Still, Philips' choice of an American outsider is a great surprise, particularly in view of the company's recent decision to sell its mini- computer operations to Digital and to concentrate insted on personal computers. But Philips-watchers point out that HP is strong in non- computer areas such as mea- surement technology, a field in which the Dutch group also specialises. They also say there will be no lack of challenges for Mr Carrubba to tackle. Sophisticated and expensive computer-chip technology is increasingly being harnessed throughout Philips' range of products, which run the gamut from shavers to X-ray equip- an ouuiaer w a surprie Louise Kehoe talks to the enthusiastic American who takes over as the company's technology chief about the challenges he faces in the future ment. With two expensive research projects about to move from the laboratory to the market place in the 1990s - high-definition television and digital compact cassettes - Mr Carrubba will have his work cut out for him. According to colleagues, Mr Carrubba has a rare combina- tion of technological and man- agement skills. Both, however, will be put to the test as he takes on his new job at the Eindhoven headquarters of Philips, whose legendary bureaucracy has been blamed for the company's failure to capitalise quickly and profit- ably on new ideas emanating from its renowned labs. At HP, he participated in the largest technology project ever undertaken by the company to develop a new range of com- puter products based on Reduced Instruction Set Com- puting (RISC) technology. He also, however, managed HP Labs during the difficult period when this huge project moved out of the laboratory and into product divisions, taking with it many of the research and development organisation's top engineers. Faced with the task of rebuilding morale among those left behind at HP Labs, Mr Car rubba turned to unconven tional methods. He took group managers on an \"experiential training\" course, somewhat like an Outward Bound course, in which they were forced to rely upon one another. The goal was to rebuild trust within the group and create a spirit of camaraderie, he says. By all accounts, the results were highly successful. Years later, HP Labs engineers still talk about their experiences. \"It was unusual, even for Hewlett-Packard and even for Silicon Valley,\" Mr Carrubba acknowledges, \"but it worked. We needed to grab people's attention, to get them to work together as teams.\" Tit inventive spirit will sit well with Philips' Operation Centurion, -a company-wide effort to Jolt the group out of its lethargy. However, Philips engineers do not necessarily face a spell of mountain climb- ing or similar gruelling activi- ties: Mr Carrubba says that he will need to take some time to understand the culture of his new co-workers and the com- pany's goals and problems before he decides upon his management strategies. Philips, he says, is a com- pany with \"spirit\". \"They are in survival mode, stepping up to the very diffi- cult challenge of improving productivity.\" He has been con- vinced, he says, by his conver- sations with Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' president, that the company is \"willing to make the hard choices ... to get out of unprofitable businesses it is burdened with.\" s technology director, he aims to identify new business opportunities that match Philips' technology strengths. With his move to Philips, Mr Carrubba will for the first time step outside the computer segment of the elec- tronics industry, where he has spent his entire career. This will also be his first job based outside the US. Both factors add to his enthusiasm for join- ing Philips. \"Consumer electronics is where the action will be in the 1990s,\" he says. \"Philips is in a position to take advances in integrated circuit technology and flt panel display technol ogy, for example, and design them into products that are .pealing and useful. Mr Carrubba says that he will also bring to Philip \"knowledge of the core teh ologies that the US needs to have access to and the attitude of the US government\". He aims to foster increased collab oration in the form of \"partner- ships and consortia\" between US and European electronics manufacturers. And he sees himelf as an ambassador ps sorts, forging closer co-opera tion between the US and Eurc ean electronics industries, th of which, he says, face common threats. \"The Japanese [electronics companies] are moving swiftly to drive a wedge as deeply as ossible between Europe and the United States,\" he says, cit- ;ng Japanese acquisitions of technology companies in the US and Europe. If the govern- ments of the US and the Euro- pean Community could collab- orate by establishing such partnerships, it would be to the long-term benefit of both regions, he says. The move to Philips will also bring Mr Carrubba closer to \"fulfilling my dreams,\" he says. A first generation Ameri- can, he says that he has long hoped to return to his roots in Europe. Ultimately, he aims to retire to Italy, the country of his fore- bears. In the meantime, how- ever, his goal is \"to make one more significant contribution\" through his work at Philips, where he hopes to play a key role in rejuvenating one of Europe's largest and oldest electronics companies.",

   "text_content" : "By Katharine Campbell in Frankfurt DUSSELDORF city prosecutors are investigating the collapse of an investment firm selling commodity futures to German investors, who stand to lose up to DM500m. The case exposes a gaping hole in the country's financial regulation system. Business in commodity futures falls out- side the scope of banking regu- lators, and some forms of investment advice can be handed out without supervi- sion. From 1987 to January 1991, around 50,000 mainly small investors each entrusted an average of DM10,000 to DM15,000 to Vermogensbil dende Sparsysteme, which translated literally means \"for tune-creating savings systems\". VBS, which functioned as the German sales agent for Ambros, a Panama-registered investment company, promised high returns from dealings in a wide range of commodity futures. Customers' monthly accounts showed annualised returns of 45 per cent in 1987. They fell steadily each year after that, but were still at 22 per cent in 1990. It appears that the few customers who chose to withdraw their funds were paid in full. The fraud stems from the fact that virtually all the commodity deals that VBS was selling actually made a loss, according to the iisseldorf prosecutors, so that the returns shown were artificial. Payments to investors were only sus- tained by drawing immediately oi funds entrusted by new savers. The system collapsed in Jan uary when Ambros declared bankruptcy in Germany on the domestic portion of its funds. Potential claims amount to around DM500m, whereas Ambros is understood to have funds available in Germany of around DM8.5m. Lawyers representing some Ambros investors say they are currently trying to estab- lish whether Ambros has fur- ther funds in the US or else- where. The German authorities have taken into custody Mr Giinter Bokels and Mr Hans J:irgen Funk, both VBS sales men, as well as Mr Richard Sax, who traded for Ambros in Chicago under the pseudonym of Richard Wagner. A warrant has also been issued for the arrest of Mr Michael-Rolf Hemmer, presi- dent of Ambros, who is a resident of Liechtenstein. There is no extradition treaty between Germany and the principality. VBS operated across Ger- many, including in the new eastern states, with around 3,000 freelance agents paid on commission. They sold by word of mouth and through client seminars.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Minerals (ACM) said yesterday the federal government's For- eign Investment Review Board (FIRB) had accepted revised proposals for the sale of a 50 per cent stake in its Mount Keith nickel project to Outo- kumpu Metals and Resources of Finland. The announcement is a blow to a hostile takeover bid for ACM launched by Western Mining Corporation (WMC) and Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group. WMC and Normandy last week increased their bid from 90 cents a share to A$1.11, valuing the target company at A$260m (US$204.7m). However, the bid- ders have made clear that the offer would not proceed if the sale of a half-interest in Mount Keith goes through. The offer, through a joint venture vehicle called Resplen- did, is structured to allow WMC to take full control of the Mount Keith project, with ACM's gold mines and other as\"ets going to Normandy Poseidon. The deal would give WMC secure access to the low- grade ore at Mount Keith, in Western Australia, which could be used to feed its nickel smelter at nearby Kambalda. ACM announced recently that it planned to sell half of Mount Keith to Outokumpu, which will also take manage- ment control. The Finnish group will retain most of the mine's reve- nue for the next two decades in return for an initial A$80m payment to ACM. ACM said it had received notification that Mr John Kerin, the Australian trea- surer, had no objection to the sale, which would be put to shareholders for approval on September 23. The group did not say what changes had been made to the proposal to secure FIRB approval.",

North said net profits from its core mining and industrial division increased to A$159m from A$109m last year, mainly because of record production at the Robe River iron ore mine, in which it has a 53 per cent interest. Net profits from uranium mining by the group's 65 per cent-owned subsidiary Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) fell from A$131m to A$102m because of lower prices for ura- nium U308. Profits from forestry and paper activities were down from A$55m to A$32m because of competition from imports and depressed demand for paper caused by recession in Australia. Pasminco, which is 40 per cent owned by North, increased production of zinc and lead, but lower prices and the high value of the Austra- lian dollar severely affected profitability, the group said. Last week, Pasminco that said it was unlikely to pay a dividend in the current year.",

Plmco was the client which unknowingly bid for Slbn of Treasury bonds in February when Mr Paul Moser, the for- mer head of bond trading at Salomon, tried to play a prac- tical Joke on a departing col- league. Mr Mozer was fired last month over the auction- rigging scandal that engulfed the securities firm at the beginning of Auust. The joke bid, which Mr Mozer never Intended to be submitted, eventually led to the US Treasury awarding over $870m in 30-year bonds to Pimco. The investment fund never knew it owned the secu- rities, which after the auction were placed into the account of another Salomon customer and eventually sold back to Salomon. Mr William Gross, manag- ing director at Pimco, said yes- terday that the suspension was indefinite, and that there was no possibility of Salomon earn- ing a reprieve. The suspension does not apply to other securities such as equities or corporate bonds, but Salomon will still lose a substantial amount of busi- ness because of the decision.

Varig, cur- rently the largest Brazilian airline, has the remainder of the domestic market. The merger is part of an expansion programme led by Vasp's president, Mr Wagner Canhedo, who bought a major- ity holding in the airline when it was privatised last October. Vasp was formerly run by the state government of Sao Paulo, which still holds a 40 per cent share in the group.

Mr Fred Richardson, Crown's chief executive, said the move would substantially reduce rental and other operat- ing costs. Although all 1,200 head office staff will be offered jobs in Regina, the company expects that only about half will be willing to make the move. Haro's investment will take the form of convertible pre- ferred shares. Crown is setting aside C$50m of the proceeds to cover the costs of the move. Another C$100m is earmarked for extra provisions on the company's troubled US real estate portfolio, leaving C$100m for investment in Crown's capital. While the move to Regina will bring long-term savings to the company and its employ- ees, it' will add at least one headache to doing business in the US, where Crown earns about two-thirds of its pre- mium income. Regina is only 100 miles north of the US border, but there are no non-stop flights from there to any US city. Crown Life's 151 offices also include operations in Britain, Hong Kong and the Caribbean.",

   "text_content" : "THE Canadian federal government and the province of Ontario are prepared to jointly fund C$303m (US$266m) in development aid for Boe- ing's de Havilland commuter aircraft division over five years, Reuter reports. The federal agency Invest- ment Canada said the aid would be on a project-by-proj- ect basis. The announcement came after the Canadian government decided to postpone yester- day's deadline on whether to approve a bid for the company from a consortium comprising Alenia Spa and Aerospatiale of France. Investment Canada said the European consortium was will- ing to accept a Canadian part- ner in its bid, a condition laid down by the federal govern- ment, but no Canadian com- pany took up the offer. Ontario's industry minister, Mr Ed Philip, announcing the province's aid decision, said: \"I wouldn't be here if I thought we couldn't turn this thing around.\" Commenting on Boe- ing's inability to turn a profit at de Havilland, Mr Philip said: \"Boeing was basically in a dif- ferent type of business - wide- bodied jets. We think the part- nership with [the consortium] has tremendous potential.\" Aerospatial and Alenia, like de Havilland, specialise in making small 30 to 70-seat commuter aircraft, Mr Philip said. He said he believed the best way to protect jobs and research and development in Ontario was to seek an equity position in the industry.",

   "text_content" : "IBy Martin ~)ckson in New York CONTINENTAL Bank, the Chicago-based group which last month announced plans for a dividend cut and $175m of third-quarter special charges, yesterday had its credit ratings cut by two of the leading US rating agencies. Standard & Poor's lowered the ratings on Continental's senior debt from Triple-B to Triple-B-minus, while Fitch Investor's Service lowered the senior notes'from Triple-B-Plus to Triple-B. Continental's third-quarter charge involved $150m of spe- cial loan-loss provisions, partic- ularly in the residential prop- erty market, and $25m to cover the consolidation of overseas operations and the closure of its primary dealership in US government securities. However, S&P said the restructuring effort did not \"sufficiently address the funda- mental problem of a declining revenue base or the company's weakened competitive position in a rapidly changing whole- sale banking market\". It added that \"the drag from a high level of non-performing loans and the possibility of increased funding costs could put pressure on an already thin net interest margin\". S&P expected a further increase in non-performing assets and said the company might need to supplement the loss reserve again. It noted the bank had a large exposure to the troubled California prop- erty market. Fitch said the greatest near- term risks involved funding and liquidity disruptions. It did not expect a liquidity crisis, due the bank's extended matu- rities and sound cash position."

   "text_content" : "SPANISH banks, although particularly creditworthy, face a more challenging future, marked by fiercer competition and rapid financial services innovation, according to Moody's Investors Service, Reuters reports. In its annual report on the Spanish banking system, Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said Spain's slowing economic growth had begun to hurt its banking. Moody's analysts say Span- ish banks' profitability will come under pressure in the short term because of greater provisioning, more problem loans and high overheads. Moudy's said Spanish banks had been protected by a highly regulated domestic operating environment and had enjoyed excellent profitability. Now, it adds, the positive impact of the changing envi- ronment had weakened or dis- appeared. The rating agency said the Spanish banks' challenges could be offset by positive sac- tors, including increased fund- ing through retail deposits. The Spanish central bank in 1990 reduced the cash reserve requirement to 5 per cent from 17 per cent to give the banks a better chance of competing for deposts.",

   "text_content" : "THE GOVERNMENT of New South Wales is preparing to bring the state-owned GIO life insurance company to the mar- ket in what would rank as Aus- tralia's second largest privati- sation, writes Kevin Brown. The largest was the A$1.3bn (US$1.03bn) flotation of 29 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank earlier this year. Mr George Souris, a senior minister in the state's Liberal/ National Party coalition gov- ernment, said the flotation should be completed by April. Analysts believe it will raise more than A$lbn. Mr Souris, who is chairman of the coalition's GIO privatisa- tion task force, said the gov- ernment planned to sell 100 per cent of the company, which is the fifth biggest Australian life insurance company. \"We are pretty pleased to see how the Commonwealth Bank float went, and this is in the same blue chip variety,\" Mr Souris said. The partial flotation of the Commonwealth Bank by the federal government earlier this year attracted 200,000 inves- tors. The issue closed A$600m oversubscribed, suggesting a healthy appetite for privatisa- tion stocks. Mr Souris said the pricing of the GIO float was still being considered, but 70 per cent of the shares were likely to be allocated to private investors. The remainder were likely to be allocated to domestic insti- tutions, possibly with a share- holding limit of around 10 per cent of the stock. GIO reported a 14.5 per cent fall in net profit to A$104m last year because of a run of natu- ral disasters. The insurer paid a dividend of A$23m to the state government. The company markets life insurance, superannuation products and financial services.",

   "text_content" : "iy Um Slong Hoon in Kuala Lumpur SIME Darby, the largest of Malaysia's conglomerates, yes- terday warned about uncer- tainty ahead after announcing that pretai profits in the year to June rose 11 per cent to M$679m (US$244.2). Turnover rose 12 per cent to M$5.6bn from M$5bn while aPeratl Lptatnpoed A per c=t to B9slii Ot=id incoMI^n~' nd a 'share ofassociates' prof its added Mn16m. The-.roup said it hoped \"to maintain something close to its current level of profitability.\" The Maldysian economy is expected to continue decelera- ting from its previous double-digit GDP growth, and Sime Darby's future results will be affected by recent increases in interest rates and the lowering of tariffs. While group pre-tax profit rose largely because of its property division, which- gained 68 per cent to MI93m, profit declined in -plantations and manufacturing by 37 and 9 per cent respectively, to MS27m and M37m. After-tax profit, at MS471m, was 18 per cent higher, while net earnings, after M$161m in minority interests, rose 9 per cent to M$310m, or nearly 20 cents a share compared with 18 cents. A lower extraordinary reduced the attributable profit to M$380m from M$420m. The group recommended a 6 per cent second-half dividend, or 12 cents, bringing the year's total to 15.5 cents. Sime Darby's tractors, motors and heavy equipment group reported a 5 per cent increase in turnover to MS1.3bn. Pre-tax profit rose 1 per cent to M$146m. * Turnover at Consolidated Plantations fell by 4 per cent to M$744m, while net earn ings dropped 14 per cent to M$38m. Gains from land sales added M$145m for a 266 per cent higher attributable of M$183m. *At Sime UEP Properties turnover improved 53 per cent to M$472m, while pre-tax profit rose 82 per cent to M$110m. Net earnings, at M$65m, dou- bled to 16 cents a share.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Hall in Wellington NEW Zealand's electricity supply companies are to be pri- vatised, with most of the shares given to consumers within five years, Mr John Luxton, the energy minister, announced yesterday. The previous Labour admin- istration shelved a similar pro- posal after a public backlash and opposition from a number of municipal power authorities, including Wellington and Dun- edin. The opponents argued that the assets had been built up by ratepayers over the past century and belonged to them, not consumers. In many other centres, how- ever, the government recently replaced elected electricity boards with its own nominees in preparation for the change. The authorities and boards have assets which are conser- vatively valued at between NZ$2.5bn (US$1.44bn) and NZ$3bn. Under the change, the average household is expected to receive shares .worth NZ$1,400. Mr Luxton told a conference that the government had decided that the supply author- ities were owned by the con- sumers of electricity. The authorities were to be incorporated and the majority of the shares transferred to consumers. Trusts were to be set up to oversee the handling of the shares, and where the new companies were to be suc- cessors of municipal power boards, the associated local authority would be vested with the shares. It is understood that 70 per cent of the shares in each authority must be sold, but the remainder could be held by trusts or local groups. Mr Luxton said he was aware that there were aspects of the change that would not be popular, but the govern- ment believed that the cross- substitution issues, where con- sumers were subsidised by industry and heavy users, were too important to be left unchanged. Consumer groups say that the shares will rapidly end up in the hands of major energy companies, including Fletcher Challenge, Brierley Invest- ments or Electricorp. They also argue that prices for household consumers will rise by up to 30 per cent. Mr Luxton said that giving shares to consumers would help offset the impact of the price rises, and he expected the new companies would be mod- erate in their charges. * Brierley Investments has sold Whitcoulls, the book and stationery retail chain, to the printing company Rank Group for NZ$71.2m. Whitcoulls, New Zealand's largest supplier of books and stationery, made a pre-tax profit of NZ$1l.lm on sales of NZ$182m in the year to end- June.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomson in Tokyo SEKISUI HOUSE, the leading Japanese housebuilder, reported a 14.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y47.88bn ($350.5m) for the first half-year to end-July. The improvement came in spite of a downturn in the property market which has put several of Sekisui's com- petitors under extreme sinan- cial pressure. The Osaka-based company said that total sales for the period rose 11.5 per cent to Y537.4bn, with housing sales rising by 11 per cent to Y450.8bn, and an operating profit 7.9 per cent higher at Y41.2bn. While other Japanese build- ers have been hurt by their rapid expansion into the spec- ulative one-room apartment market, Sekisul House has been involved in larger urban redevelopment projects and, generally, is considered to be more conservative than many of its competitors. The Japanese property mar- ket has turned down sharply, with a 21 per cent decline in housing starts in July, com- pared with the same month last year. Sekisui House expects sales for the full year to total Y1,090bn, up from Y1,032bn, with pre-tax profit at Y90bn, slightly higher than last year's Y88bn.",

   "text_content" : "JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance (MoS) is considering regular monitoring of the activities and profits of non-bank sinan cial institutions to improve its regulation of the financial industry, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The MoS said: \"We need to understand non-banks' busi- ness conditions to conduct an effective monetary policy,\" adding that the ministry would soon set up a study group to work out detailed methods of monitoring these institutions. The MoS already monitors non-banks' property-related loans as many of them have financed the speculative prop- erty deals that have driven up Japanese land prices. Non-banks include leasing companies and consumer credit firms, which offer loans without accepting deposits and rely largely on bank loans to finance their lending. Because they do not accept deposits, non-banks are now loosely regulated by the Minis- try of International Trade and Industry. The study group will consider whether legal changes are required for the finance ministry to monitor the non- bank institutions. Several non-banks are suffer- ing from bad debts and defaults due to the collapse of property companies hit by tight money policies and restrictions on property-related loans, analysts said. Bank fraud cases have also undermined the position of some non-banks, the analysts said. Non-banks' total assets are estimated at about Y7bn ($52m).",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron in New York and Sar Webb in London US TREASURY prices firmed at the long end yesterday, aided by hopes of lower inter- est rates and the sighting of several large contract buyers in the futures market. In late trading, the bench- mark 30-year government bond was up h at 101,tt yielding 7.989 GOVERNMENT BONDS per cent. There was less move ment at the short end of the market, however, with the two year note up A at 100&, yield ing 6.204 per cent. Trading was reported to be light because of the Jewish New Year holiday. The buying in both the futures and the underlying market was prompted by hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates. Figures released late last week showed the economy still moving very slowly out of recession, and the market thinks the Fed will cut the discount rate from 5% per cent to 5 per cent to inject some fresh life into the recov ery. However, the Fed may wait until data on inflation and retail sales are released this Thursday and Friday before deciding to ease monetary con- ditions. SUK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied, helped by the improved showing of the Conservative Party in opinion polls and lopes of a further cut in the base rate in the next month. However, the market slipped slightly on news that the Bdnk of England was to issue Â£600m of gilts for sale today.The Bank i selling three Â£200m tranches of the following gilts: the 9 per cent Treasury loan due 1994; the 10% per cent Exchequer stock due 1997; and the 9' per cent Treasury loan due 1999. The announcement follows Friday's news that the Bank is to auction conventional gilt on September 25 in the matu ity range 2003 to 2009. Long-dated gilts closed up a quarter point, after gaining up o half a percentage point dur ing the day. The benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/f0 opened at 113% and traded at 113 by late afternoon to yield 9.72 per cent.

The unsecured overnight call rate In Tokyo fell to 61 per cent yesterday, having trade at around 71 per cent last Thursday and 71 per cent on Friday. Traders said the sharp decline was taken as a sign that the Bank of Japan was prepared to tolerate lower money market rates. *THE Ecu bond market staged a further strong rally yester day. Traders said long-dated Ecu bonds attracted the stron- gest interest. In Germany, hopes of an eas- ing in US interest rates helped to lift government bond prices. The London International Financial Futures Exchange bund futures contract traded to 85.58 from an opening of 85.44."

   "text_content" : "By Simon London THE European Banlk for Reconstruction and Develop- ment has selected Morgan Stanley International, the International capital markets arm of the US scurities huse to lead-manage i debut bond issue. The firm won thedmandate after competing with other banks, including Paribas Capi- tal Markets and Salomon Brothers. The EBRD says that the details of its first bond Issue have yet to be finalised. Bank- ers anticipate an issue by the end of this month. The choice of Morgan Stan- ley was seen in the Euromar- ket as a sign that the EBRD is keeping its funding options open. Morgan Stanley is strong in both the Ecu sector, believed to be the EBRD's favoured option, and the Euro- dollar sector of the interna- tional bond market. The firm lead-managed the UK government's debut Ecu2.5bn bond issue in Febru- ary. However, the EBRD's first issue will be of more modest proportions: the bank envis- ages raising EcuOOm from the debt markets by the end of 1992. Bankers anticipate a deal of about EcuSOOm to EcuSOOm, or the dollar equivalent if the Ecu sector is seen as unrecep- tive to new issues. There is debate over the cor- rect pricing for an EBRD issue. The bank will be keen to achieve a price comparable with other established supra- national borrowers such as the European Investment Bank - a shareholder in the new insti- tution. Analysts noted that much of the bank's Initial Ecu570m start-up capital has been sup- plied by governments which carry a top triple-A credit rat- ing. The bank will eventually have a capital base of Ecu30bn ($25bn), provided by the 39 countries and two European institutions thai are share-' holders. However, since the bank has only Just begun to lend money to eastern Europe, the quality of its assets is unknown.",

   "text_content" : "By imon London THE Mortgage Corporation (TMC), a UK mortgage lender, ay attempted to breathe e into the sterling mortgage- backed securities sector of the international bond market by launching a i300m issue. The deal, Issued through a special purpose -company INTERNATIONAL BONDS called PIMBS 7th Finance, is the largest transaction backed by a pool of UK residential mortgages for nearly a year. The deal is lead-managed by Salomon Brothers Interna- tional and has an average life of 4.58 years - bonds are redeemed as the underlying mortgages are paid off. It was priced to pay bond- holders a margin of 52 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. The deal carries a triple-A credit rating on the basis of a separate tranche of Â£35m sub- ordinated notes which absorb any losses if there are defaults on the mortgages. In the past, the borrower has always used insurance companies to protect bondholders from default risk. However, the downgrading of several leading UK insur- ance companies has already forced TMC to take out addi- tional insurance to protect the credit quality of some of its earlier bond issues. Participants in the deal con- sidered the pricing fair, although a deal of this size will take time to be fully absorbed by the market. The lead man- ager held the issue at the fixed reoffer price of 99.77 until the close of trading. Crddit National, the French state financial institution, joined the ranks of borrowers in the Euro-French franc mar- ket launching \"jumbo\" deals when it issued FFr3bn-worth of 10-year bonds. The deal, lead managed by Crddit Commerciale de France, carries a coupon of 9% per cent and was priced to yield 45 basis points more than French gov- ernment securities of similar maturity. This was in line with other deals in the sector. For example, Finland's recent NEW INTERNATIONAL BOND ISSUES norrwer Amount m.

FFrSbn deal was yesterday trading at a Ã½ield spread of 42 basids polna over government P iciats said the deal was tightly priced, but sold well to lntenational investors with a positive view of the prospects for the French cur- rency, The lead manager held the deal at the fixed reoffer price of 99.50 until the close. In the Eurodollar sector, Export Development Corpora- tion came.with a tightly-priced $200mo three-year deal, lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The bonds carry a cou- pon of 7 per cent and were priced to yield 31 basis points over US government paper. The yield spread was consid- ered very tight by participants - \"at the razor's edge\", com- mented one syndicate manager - but a positive tone in the Eurodollar market and the credit quality of the issuer helped the deal to sell. BMW Finance, the funding arm of the German motor man- ufacturer, took advantage of demand within Germany for Swedish kronor, launching a SKr400m seven-year deal lead- managed by Dresdner Bank. The deal offers a coupon of 10% per cent, and was priced to yield 10.85 per cent at issue price less full fees. Since the Swedish currency is linked to the Ecu, such paper offers German investors a high yield with limited cur- rency risk. However, other European investors remain more cautious. The lead man- ager estimated that 80 per cent of the paper had been bought by German investors.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong JARDINE Matheson's plan to move its primary listing to London, but for its shares to remain tradeable in Hong Kong, is to come under public scrutiny following the release yesterday of a consultative document by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The exchange insisted it remained open-minded about Jardine's plans and would lis ten to the views of market practitioners before deciding. But it is generally thought to De prepared to accept the pro posals in case Jardine, which accounts for about 9 per cent iof market capitalisation, delists from Hong Kong. However, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's overall market watchdog, has delayed eter- ing the debate, having said it would issue public consultative documents in June. Now, the SFC says its documents, which mainly address implications under Hong Kong's takeover code, will be released only if the exchange agrees in princi- pie to Jardine's proposal. The SFC's move is designed to deflect criticism of its role. If Jardine is granted \"trading only\" status, China is likely to criticise the government and SFC for bowing to pressure from the British Keswick fam- ily, which controls Jardine. Some bankers may join the attack, saying the proposals undermine Hong Kong's efforts to be seen as an international financial centre. Jardine hopes to move its primary listing to London early next year. This may now have to be delayed. Jardine is domiciled in Bermuda and would not be covered by the London takeover code. A sepa rate Jardine proposal tc remain subject to the Hong Kong takeover code for three years cannot be negotiated until the exchange and SFC finish their consultations. In its 64-page document, the exchange gave four options for dealing with Jardine's pro- posal. At issue is the extent of Hong Kong's regulatory con- trol over Jardine, given that about 75 per cent of trading in the group's shares takes place in the colony with 25 per cent in London, and more than 9C per cent of trading in associate Hongkong Land is conducted in Hong Kong.",

   "text_content" : "By Kreln Fossil in Oslo NEW NORWEGIAN field developments stand to lose out under new petroleum tax reform proposals recently pres- ented by the Government, according to a study under- taken by Edinburgh-based County NatWest WoodMac. The study also says that the reforms will give no specific encouragement to exploration for and development of small oil and gas field prospects Norwegian authorities hope to submit petroleum taxatior reform together with the gen eral tax reform proposal to the Storting, Norway's parliament, in October. The aim is to implement the reform from January 1, 1992. Their goal is to simplify the petroleum taxation regime, through the abolition of roy alty, production allowance and \"uplift\" (allowances against tax) and a dividend reduction, without causing an impact on government revenue over the next five years. \"However, the proposals will clearly benefit some companies at the expense of others,\" believes CNWM. Government revenues are expected'to be maintained in the face of a reduction in corporation tax to 28 per cent from 50.8 per cent and a loss of income from roy- alty payments, it says. This is to be achieved partly through a reduction in allowances and partly through an increase in the special petroleum tax to between 48 per cent and 50 per cent from 30 per cent. Companies with interests in mature field developments like Ekofisk, Statflord, Gullfaks and Oseberg - Norway's main crude oil producers - will ben- efit under the new regime. CNWM calculates that the remaining value of the Ekoflsk field will increase by more than 10 per cent while compa- nies with interests in fields developed under current legis- lation will have their remain- ing values reduced signifi- cantly. For the Troll East develop- nient the remaining value will be reduced by NKr5bn (Â£430m), or 35 per cent, it calculates. The Edinburgh-based analyst concludes that the tax propos- als will be vigorously contested by partners in new develop- ments, which could mean across-the-board rejection by all oil companies because Nor- way's licensing agreements comprise several companies. However, for Norway's oil- dependent economy, the con- sideration will have to centre on maintaining investments so as to maintain the level of crude oil production, currently above 2m barrels a day, so as continue the flow of funds to state coffers which finance the cradle-tograve welfare state.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent DEMAND FOR manganese, used mainly in steel produc tion, will fall during the 1990s and the most substantial droc will be in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, suggests the Roskill Information Services consultancy group. This region at present has the highest level of unit consumption at 12 kg of manganese for every tonne of steel produced, Roskill points out in a report. The eastern European steel industry in the 1990s is expec ted to reduce production capac ity to two-thirds of the 198s level, it says, while efficiency improvements should increase the manganese yield from 60 to 90 per cent. Roskill says world produc- tion of manganese ore was about 23.87m tonnes last year, a slight fall from the 23.93m tonnes in 1989. The Soviet Union is the biggest producer (8.8m tonnes in 1990), followed by South Africa (3.8m tonnes), China (2.7m tonnes) and Gabon (2.5m tonnes). Reserves of high-grade metallurgical man- ganese ore are restricted to South Africa, which has about 80 per cent of the total, Gabon, Australia and Brazil. Roskill suggests reserves of high grade ore in the Soviet Union are depleted and that the country is now a net importer. SThe main South African sup- pliers, Samancor and Asso- mang, were unaffected by sanc- tions because manganese was classified as a strategic metal but demand for manganese in South Africa should increase as sanctions against steel exports are lifted, Roskill sug- gests.

   "text_content" : "iy Kevin Jrun in Sydney AUSTRALIA'S WHEAT crop will allby a third to lOam tonnes this year, mainly because of drought in Queen: and and northern New South Wales, the Australian Wheat Board said yesterday. The forecast compares with production of 15.7m tonnes in 1990-91, and is the smallest since 192, when the country produced 88m tonnes. The worst hit state is Queensland, where the crop Is ikely to be only 400,000 tonnes, the smallest for 21 years. Mr John Lawrenson, the wheat board's managing direc tor, said there were prospects of recovery in western New South Wales if rain falls in the near future. However, the remaining crop is threatened by kangaroos driver off drought stricke listl land. Mr Lawrenson ,said only Western AuStrala was free of serious rowing problems. ro- duction should rsach 4.7m tonnes, nearly half the national total The crop shortfall has raised fears among wheat growers that Australia could lose its reputation as a reliable sup- plier of high quality wheat. However, Mr Lawrenson said the board would concentrate on serving long-term custom- ers who might otherwise turn to other suppliers. The lower crop forecast fol- lows complaints by Australian farmers that world wheat prices are being driven down by unfair marketing o subsi- dised wheat by the US and the European Community. Australia has protested to the US about several sales of subsidised wheat to what it regards as its traditional mar- kets in China, Kuwait and Yemen. The Yemeni sale took place in spite of a US promise to avoid disrupting traditional Australian markets. Australian farmers claim sales under the US Export Enhancement Program, will cost them up to A$lbn (Â£460m) in lost sales this year, and could have severe long term effects on AuBtralia's global market share. So far, the government has rejected calls for retaliatory action, such as the closure of US military bases. The US argues that EEP sales are intended to force the EC to reduce export subsidies."

   "text_content" : "T Hi -QUIIBRlUM OF Lord Emsworth - \"happy as only a fluffy minded man with excellent health and a large income could be\" - would have been very much disturbed by the knowldgefl t thae Empress m-, Blandings, his prize sow, was aW member of an aedangered spe- cies..\" The Empress, Wodehouse fans should recall, was a Berk- shire pig, a breed that is on the critical list of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. A latter-day Lord Emsworth would undoubtedly have been among the founder members of the trust in 1973. It is dedicated to preventing pigs like the Empress and other farm ani- mals from becoming just a folk memory. Sadly, the threat of Blue Ear disease kept all pigs away from the trust's annual show last Friday and Saturday at the National Agricultural Centre at Stoneleigh. Blue Ear disease, a highly contagious viral infec- tion that causes sows to abort, would be disastrous for variet- ies whose total breeding popu- lation can be as few as 150. So the trust had no hesitation in sticking this year to 28 breeds of rare and endangered cattle and sheep, as well as poultry and water fowl. In the 10 years before the trust was founded, 10 national- ly-known breeds of British farm animal became extinct, according to Sir Richard Coo- per, the chairman. These included the Cumberland pig The wool of the \"o acknrowledged as the ale breed is in the world een Iusue 1on0wi (there are now no hairy pigs in the UK) and the Norfolk horn sheep. The latter can take the credit for the trust's formation. The Royal Agricultural Society, the London Zoological Society and the Cotswold Farm Park had 12 females and only one ram, who chose not to do his duty. \"So all those highly respected peo- pie had egg on their faces,\" said Sir Richard. \"The breed died out with them watching.\" While there is still a Norfolk horn flock, it is is only 80 to 90 per cent pure and remains on the trust's critical list with less than 300 breeding ewes. But since the trust started its work, no breeds have become extinct in the UK. Sir Richard believes there are two sides to the trust's work. One is the conservation of the genetic material from which all modern farm animals are derived, the second is the sheer enjoyment in the variety of animals. The trust now has 10,000 members, 12 employees, and an annual income of Â£400,000 from subscriptions, donations and sponsorship, and investments. There is no such thing as a typical member, according to Mr Lawrence Alderson, the trust's new executive director. \"They range from the person who keeps a few as a hobby to the commercial farmer to sci- entists and academics,\" he said. \"We could be advising on the setting up of an experiment or the keeping of a couple ani- mals in an orchard.\" While there is no doubt that part of its success can be attri- buted to the rural tradition of county shows and plain British eccentricity, the movement is now becoming international. Both Sir Richard and Mr Aldenson returned last month from the first meeting of Rare Breeds International in Buda- pest. Mr Alderson sees an increasing role for the trust globally, both in genetic con- servation and in political lob- bying. He cites a European Commu- nity directive that would place severe restrictions on the use of bovine semen collected before 1990. \"A large part of our work is based on semen put away for long-term stor- age,\" he said. \"Through action we can get some influence on the application of such legisla- tion.\" The trust can be seen as a bulwark against the threat of a standard Europig, Eurosheep and Eurocow. Mr Alastair Dymond, the trust field direc- tor, is concerned at the rate of closure of local abattoirs because of tightening EC regu- lations on meat hygiene. The number of abattoirs in the UK has halved in the last 10 years to less than 1,000, and is expected to halve again in the next 10 years, he said. Rare breed animals are by definition slaughtered in very small quantities, sometimes only one at a time. \"The large abattoirs cannot guarantee you actually get your animal carcass back,\" he said. The same problem of tiny quantities adds to the difficulty of marketing the meat - supermarkets are not inter- ested. However, rare breed fans are fervent in their praise for the meat they produce. Mr Zed Zorichak, a small- holder from Llanybydder, Dyfed, keeps Leicester. Long- wool sheep, selling the fleece to hand spinners. \"But we keep the meat from 18-month to two- year-olds,\" he said. \"A chop is like a T-bone steak, a leg does 10 or 12 people, and the flavour of the mutton is quite incredi- ble.\" Mr Dymond believes the opportunity to market such meat to butchers and delicates- sens is high - \"but it has to be slaughtered and sold locally\". The highest prices paid this year for a bull and a ram were 3,200 guineas for a Gloucester and 500 guineas for a Hebri- dean, but some cattle could be bought for Â£400 and sheep for as little as Â£5. \"At the top end of the pedi- gree range we get breeder buy- ing from breeder,\" said Mr Dymond. \"But very much is new buying. That's why the show is so important as a facil- ity - you get the man from Orkney selling to the man from Cornwall. Without this facility there would be no intermix of genetics.\" Meanwhile, the absence of pigs kept attendance at the show down to about 6,000, com- pared with 10,000 last year, which goes to show that Lord Emsworth is not alone in being potty about pigs.",

   "text_content" : "S ARIBBEAN BANANA S producers are reporting . some success in efforts to protect their access to the European Community after the creation of a single market at the end of next year. Following a diplomatic offen sive which has seen intensive lobbying in several EC capi tals, government leaders say there is general sympathy with their position that the region's banana industry cannot sur vive unless it receives some form of protection on the Euro pean market. They say, however, that they have not yet managed to get any comfort from their meet- ings with German officials anÃ½ those of the Benelux countries. Unless the Germans soften their position, say representa- tives of the industry in the region, the Caribbean produc- ers will continue to be uneasy about the future of their indus- try. \"We have always had the support of the British and we are getting support from the French,\" said Mr John Com- ton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading producer in the Windward Islands. \"Both of these have said that our interests will not be sacri- ficed. We have had some show of support from Spain. But there are others who are harder to address, such as Ger- many and the Benelux coun- tries. But I believe they will eventually come around because there is growing sym- pathy for our position from the majority of the EC states.\" The industry in the Com- monwealth Caribbean coun- tries has been supported by preferential access to the Brit- ish market. This has allowed the industry in the Windward SIslands (St Lucia, Dominica, St Vincent and Grenada) to pros- per, although the hilly terrain, small-scale production and labour rates make production costs about 30 per cent higher than those of Latin American banana producers. The other Commonwealth Caribbean producers (Jamaica and Belize) have lower produc- tion costs but would still not fare well in open competition with Latin American fruit. Open competition on a deregu- lated European market would damage an industry that employs 15 per cent of Domi- nica's work force and accounts for 60 per cent of the island's foreign earnings. The Caribbean producers have been encouraged by an undertaking given by the EC that traditional banana suppli- ers from the African, Carib- bean and Pacific group of coun- tries will be no worse off after the creation of a single market next year. The producers are hoping that there will be acceptance by all EC states of ACP propos- als for a quota on banana imports from other sources. They have proposed that this quota be agieed jointly by the ACP states and the EC, based on the requirement of the EC market after ACP supplies have been determined. Miss Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, shares Mr Compton's optimism that the region will have some form of preferential access to the EC after the creation of the single market. Based on the EC's undertaking, she said, there will be some method of organising the market to guar- antee earnings for the region's producers. But like Mr Compton, Miss Charles has found the Ger- mans to be the hardest to con- vince. \"The Germans, who are the biggest buyers of bananas, do not want high prices for the fruit on their domestic mar- ket,\" Miss Charles said. \"They appear inclined to purchase cheaper Latin American bananas. My message to the Germans is that they are ask- ing the impossible in wanting cheaper fruit. The German housewife will have to pay more for her bananas.\" .. While asking for some form of market protectioi, the Caribbean producers are trying to improve their industry to make it more competitive. Mr Compton admitted that what- ever agreement was reached between the EC and the ACP much more would need to be done in the region to make its bananas more competitive. \"We have to become efficient and we have to improve our productivity and the quality of the fruit we produce,\" the prime minister said. Miss Charles has concluded, however, that getting conser vative farmers to make' whole sale changes to old agricultural habits will not be easy. While some countries are attempting to get farmers to look at other crops, there is little credibility now in earlier suggestions that bananas be abandoned. Farmers are also unlikely to forsake an industry which has been very profitable for them, despite the fact that this profit- ability has been underwritten by market preferences that are now threatened. The Jfour Windward .4 and have traditionally acp.iintsd for two out of every three bananas eaten in Britain and would suffer severe economic dislocation were they to lose market share in a deregulated Europe. Earnings from banana exports to Britain bring in about US$190m per year for the four islands, providing the basis for continuing economic growth and the region's most stable currency."

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR was in sharp retreat as London foreign exchange trading closed yester- day. It fell about one pfennig against the D-Mark in a few- minutes to finish near the day's low. Stop loss selling added to the decline pushing the US currency through tech- nical resistance at DM1.69M0. Traders went short of dollars in expectation that the Federal Reserve will ease its monetary stance to boost a stuttering economic recovery. The Fed- eral Reserve added liquidity to the New York banking system, via three-day system repur- chase agreements, but Federal funds were trading at 5A per cent at the time. This was above the assumed target of 5'/ per cent and therefore the action did not appear to signal a change in policy. A further test of policy may have to wait until later this week, after pub- lication of August US producer prices on Thursday and the consumer price index for the same month on Friday. Selling built up in New York on Friday as dealers decided that the August US employ- ment report was not strong enough to prevent the Fed from easing. It continued in the Far East and Europe yes- terday, amid suggestions that Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, had sold dollars at around DM1.7100.

A recent survey by Merrill Lynch found that 11 per cent of international investors were heavily overweight In dol- lar currency exposure, with 47 per cent moderately over- weight and only 2 per cent eavily underweight. This con- tsd with D-Mark's, Dutch guilders and Swiss francs, -here no investors surveyed were heavily overweight, 15 per cent were moderately over- weight and 28 per cent were heavily underweight. At the London close the dol lar had fallen to DM1.6955 from DM1.7315; to Y134.90 from Y136.10; to SFrl.4890 from SFr1.5235; and to FFr5.7650 from SFr5.8800. Its index declined to 65.4 from 66.3.

The FT-Actuaries World Index eased 0.05 per cent in local currency terms. Japan responded with enthusiasm to a fall in short-term interest rates, which encouraged hopes of a cut in the discount rate. On Friday, daily trading volume in Tokyo passed 600m shares for the first time in 10 weeks. In contrast, the American market was worried early last week that evidence of an improving economy would pre- vent an interest rate reduc- tion. Wall Street, shut on Mon- day for Labor Day, fell sharply on Tuesday and marked time for the rest of the week. Elsewhere, an actual nter- et rate cut, rather than the mere prospect of one, lifted Australia, while South Africa fimed on demand for quality shares in a thin market. Within Europe, it was left to the smaller Eurpean markets to produce the week's excite- ment. All the Scandinavian markets moved lower, with Sweden and Norway showing the worst losses. UBS Phillips& Drew says the crisis in the Swedish sinan- cial and property sectors is one of the causes of concern. \"More casualties will follow, as high leveraged property holdings are facing sharp downgradings of valuation,\" says UBS, adding that last week saw the first bankruptcy - ofNJord AB - in the insur- ance sector since 1913. The broker also expects that political uncertainty, in the run-up to the elections on Sep- tember 15, will weigh on the market this week. The best performer last week was Austria. The facto which have caused the bourse to underperform since June - the crises in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union - are now discounted in pri according to Mr Lukas Stipkovich of Giroentrae Cpl Manage- ment. Demand from foreigner has boosted turnover, he says, and he believes that the cur- rent rally has another 7 to 10 per cent to run.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo RUMOURS OF a bankruptcy depressed the stock market yesterday, reversing an initial advance for the Nikkei, writes mniko Terazono in Tobko. The index closed at the ses- sion's low of 22,573.98, down 118.62, after setting a day's high of 22,954.24 at the end of morning trading. Buying by foreigners and dealers on hopes of an imminent discount rate cut prompted an early rally, but arbitrage-related sell- ing later helped to push the Nikkei into negative territory. Volume fell to 300m shares from Friday's 650m. Activity petered out as institutional investors failed to follow the foreigners' morning lead. Rises still led declines by 512 to 444 at the close, with 185 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.78 to 1,758.58 but, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.93 to 1,332.32. Two construction companies listed on the second section, Dia Kensetsu and its affiliate, Daiwa Construction, held a joint press conference after the market had closed to deuv rumours that the companie~ were facing financial 'dficul ties. Market partcipants\"have become increstngly nervous over bankruptcies of listed rel estate and construction compa- nies, after the recent failure of Maruko, the condominium developer which is listed on the over-the-counter market. Daiwa Construction closed at an offered price of Y920, down by the daily loss limit of Y200, and Dia Kensetsu, Daiwa's top shareholder, dropped the daily limit of Y300 to Y1,650. Large-capital shares fell on profit-taking, Nippon Steel by Y10 to Y426. Interest focused on high-priced small-capital issues such as TDK, Y30 ahead at Y5,430. Hazama and Kumagai Gumi, both leading contractors, advanced on speculation that they might be adopted as com- ponent issues of the Nikkei 225 index. The Nihon Keizai Shim- bun, the publisher of the index, plans to reshuffle the compo nent stocks next month. Hazama climbed Y49 to Y86C and Kumagai Gumi gained Y8 to Y752. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 104.79 to 24,970.52 in vol- ume of 27.7m shares. Chemi- cals and pharmaceuticals ained, while machineries and h-tchnolog issues fell on profit-taking. Nintendo, the video game maker, ained Y200 to Y18,000 on broadly based buying. Investors were encour- aed by last week's settlement or most of its margin positions. Roundup THE PACIFIC region was mostly lower yesterday. MANILA dropped 4.4 per cent, its worst decline for nearly three months, as inves- tors unloaded positions on fears of an imminent rejection by the Philippine Senate of the US bases treaty, which would permit the US to continue operating military posts in the Philippines for another 10 years. The composite index lost 44.47 to 958.75 in turnover up from 123m to 143m pesos. It dropped 46.53 on June 17, fol- lowing the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Today, the Manila and Mak- ati stock exchanges will shorten their trading time to Indos ebaused Jan 1991 Sep 0w: Ddusnm allow members to take part in a demonstration advocating the ratification of the treaty. HONG KONG fell prey to afternoon selling on renewed talk that the health of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, was failing. The Hang Seng index had risen 14 points but then dropped to close a net 30.37 down at 3,940.54. Turn- over improved to HK$1.06bn from HK$65m. Citic Pacific, the locally listed arm of Beljing's China International Trust and Invest- meat Corp, led the active stocks as it climbed 11 cents to H:$1.9 in the wake of its suc cess in buying the trading group Hang Chang. NW ZALAND only rose slightly, the NZSE-40 index ending 452 higher at 1,429.75 on low turnover of about NZ$7.9m; but the National Bank's cut in base lending rate, by one percentage point to 12.75 per cent, was expected to be good for sentiment. AU9T1ALIA drifted lower in quiet trading. The All Ordi- naries index slipped 7.3 to ,564.5 in turnover of A$105m, after Friday's AS522m that was bloated by block trades. Bank lost ground. National Australia Bank easing 2 cents to A$7.18 as it made staff cuts to reduce costs. ANZ dipped 5 cents to A$3.85 after saying it was also reviewing staff numbers. TAIWAN ended mixed in active dealings in spite of inter- est rate hopes, the weighted index easing 1.7 to 4,707.80 after an 85-point gain on Satur- day. Turnover, however, rose from T$24.2bn to TS29.4bn. KUALA LUMPUB surren dered early morning gains to profit-taking as year-end results for Sime Darby, Malay- sia's biggest conglomerate, came withinexpectatons. The composite index rose as high as 562.98 before closing just 1.24 up on balance at 559.16 after turnover of M$92.8m, against MS18m. Malayan United Manufactur- ing, which resumed trading after announcing a takeover bid for Inter-pafic Industrial Group, led the actives with 4.m s has changing hands. It jumped 24 cents to MS2.. SINGAPORE was little changed. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.58 higher at 1,421.00 in volume of S64m (S$94m). SEOUL was lifted by reports about improv- ing cash-flow situations at some small and medium-sized companies. The composite index ended at 689.25, up 7.35, in turnover of Won252.9bn. BANGKOK's turnover rose from Bt3.7bn to Bt4.8bn in a volatile session involving smaller companies, and several rounds of profit-taking. The SET index gained 5.56 to 734.07.

   "text_content" : "BOURSES EDGED lower yesterday, with Soviet debt fears upsetting the German banking sector, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reacted to renewed fears over the ability of the Soviet Union to main- tain foreign debt repayments. Banks dropped, with Commerz- bank and Dresdner showing the biggest falls, of DM6 to DM248.50 and DM8 to DM344 respectively. Deutsche Bank closed DM8.30 lower at DM647. Mr Christopher Davis, bank- ing analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, thought this an exaggerated response. Deut- sche Bank, he said, had made provisions against at least 70 per cent of its Soviet debt; other brokers revised this upward to 80 per cent at the time of the bank's interim report. Commerzbank, at the same stage, had made no provisions on this score. Mr Davis says that, by then, Commerzbank had one major Soviet debt out- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - SOp 9 Hourly chmng Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1 pm 2 pm 3 pm Cloe 1118.14 1117.71 1116.79 1116.88 1116.19 1116.19 1116.67 1116.8 Day's High 1118.54 Day's Low 1115.51 Sep 6 Sep 5 Sep 4 Sep 3 Sep 2 1124.68 1126.92 1125.48 1128.91 1126.81 Sue value 1000 (26/1090). standing and that this was from the Soviet Bank for For eign Trade, which would be inclined to service its debt just to stay in business. The DAX index ended on its intraday low of 1,633.06, down 13.12, after a 4.63 fall to 678.37 in the FAZ at midsession. Vol ume rose from DM3bn tc DM3.2bn. Among retailers, Massa dropped DM10 to DM250 on large selling orders from the UK. In steels, the excitements last week settled down: Hoesch, the centre of the take over speculation, fell only DM1 to DM305.50, but Kldckner- Werke, whose name had been linked with Hoesch, dropped DM4 to DM146 and Mannes- mann by DM3 to DM276. PARIS was enlivened by some takeover speculation, as the market slipped in light trading after sticking within a narrow range throughout the day. The CAC 40 index lost 4.51 to 1,55.88. Attention was seized by CCF, the bank, which rose to a day's high of FFr184.90, before closing FFr4.50 or 2.6 per cent higher at FFr180 in heavy vol- ume of 374,630 shares. Take- over rumours were stoked up by a French newspaper report, which said that Socilet Central d'Investissements (SCI) and Mr Raul Gardini, CCF's leading shareholders, were interested in taking control of the bank. Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, SCI chairman, yesterday denied the report. LVMH, the luxury goods group, fell another FFr52 to FFr4,009 after the Vuitton fam- ily sold part of its holding last week. The stock fell FFr39 on Friday. MILAN closed lower in thin, uncertain trading. The Comit index fell 4.16 to 549.39 in turn- over estimated at around LS0bn after L60bn on Friday. After the close the stock market watchdog, Consob, said the settlement of the August bourse account, delayed since August 30 because of an L85bn stock scandal, would take place today. Dealers had been worried that the delay in the August settlement would lead to a similar postponement in the September trading month. Flat, which is due to release its interim results on Septem ber 26, closed L85 down at L5.520 while Generall dropped L295 to L29,975. STOCKHOLM was little changed in thin volume as investors stayed at the side lines ahead of the general elec tion on Sunday. The Affirs vArlden General index was 1.7 higher at 1,063.8 In turnover of SKr283m, down from SKr333m AMSTERDAM recouped most of its early losses. The CBS tendency index, which fell to 92.0 in the morning, closed 0.2 down at 92.4. Heineken, the brewer, was steady at Fl 149 after reporting interim results at the low end of expectations late on Friday. MADRID's general index eased 1.05 to 272.30. Thin turn- over of about Pta8bn was con- centrated in a few stocks. Tele f6nica rose Pta8 to Ptal,000 in volume of 1.12m shares, and Endesa added PtalO to Pta2,67C in 1.08m shares, which included a block of about im at Pta2,655 each. VIENNA closed firmer in quiet trading. The 18-share ATX index rose 8.15 to 1,150.09. One of the day's biggest win- ners was Linderbank pre- ferred, suspended since last Wednesday during talks on fin- alising a merger with Zentral- kasse. LAnderbank gained Sch34 to Sch540. ISTANBUL's 75-share index fell below the 3,000 level, losing 41.72 to 2,971.48. The ATHENS general index dropped 27.08 or 2.7 per cent to 960.71. ZURICH was closed for a local holiday.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street SHARE PRICES traded in a narrow range, slightly below opening values as the market waited for the Federal Reserve to move on interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.47 at 3,007.16, having been only a few points lower all day and with the 3,000 mark acting as a technical floor. The more broadly based Standard & Poors 500 was also modestly weaker, dropping 0.52 to 388.58, but a late rally helped the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks post a gain of 10.13 to 518.07. Volume on the NYSE was very light at 110m shares, with many market participants absent because of the Jewish New Year holiday. All eyes remained on the Fed and monetary policy. Although hopes remained high that the discount rate would be cut from 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent, much of the impact of lower rates on the economy and cor- porate earnings has already been factored into stock prices. Figures out later this week are likely to show a further easing of inflationary pressure, and could provide the trigger for the rate cut, but what investors need now is strong signs of improved business conditions and a healthier out- look for company profits. Among individual stocks, IBM bucked the trend with a gain of $1% to $101 as investors looked forward to the launch of a second joint venture with Apple Computer to operate in the business of multi-media computing. Apple, which trades over the counter, firmed I1% to $53% in active trading. On the heels of the IBM gains, two other big technology stocks were firmer, with Hew lett-Packard up $%/ at $50%, Unisys up $% at $5% and Com- paq $% higher at $35. Digital Equipment, however, eased $1 to $60% and Motorola gave up $% to $65%. Baxter Interna tional fell $1% to $33% in heavy trading on the news that Federal authorities are investi gating whether the company gave kickbacks to doctors to increase its Medicare revenues for home health products. Hauser Chemical soared $3/% to $19% on hopes that the drug company's roadshow to pro. mote a secondary stock offer ing will go down well with pro spective investors. One of Hauser's main products is Taxol, a drug used in the treat- ment of ovarian cancer. The strength of Hauser helped another drug company. Escagenetics, which has devel- oped a synthetic form of Taxol that it has considered market- ing jointly with Bristol-Myers Squibb, jumped $% to $9% on the American Stock Exchange. Bristol-Myers was up $% at $86%. Summagraphics plummeted $2% to $8 after it projected a loss for its first quarter, which ended on August 31. The com- pany said revenues had been badly hit by the recession. Advanced Polymer climbed $% to $6% as investors bought the stock in the wake of upbeat comments about the company by the head of a fund run by Shearson Lehman Brothers, the securities house. fanada TORONTO share prices ended the session down slightly in light trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index fell 9.33 points to close at 3,478.9. Los- ing issues outpaced advances 275 to 211. Volume of 18m shares fell from Friday's 23.8m shares, and trading value dropped to C$207.8m from Fri- day's C$356m. Ten of 14 sub-groups ended lower, with mining issues and consumer products off 0.60 per cent and 0.50 per cent on index, respectively. Industrial prod- ucts, energy issues, industrial products and financial services were all slightly lower. Gold issues made small gains. MinVen Gold, up C$0.01 to C$0.51, and United Coin Mines, off C$0.01 to C$0.30, said they reached an agreement in prin- ciple under which MinVen will acquire United Coin.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor ADVERSE currency factors, together with a profits warning from British Aerospace and fears that this company will hit the market with a substan- tial rights issue later this week, yesterday depressed a UK stock market already unsettled by political uncer- tainties. Weakness in the US currency brought falls across the broad range of the blue chip dollar-earning stocks, and this, in turn, took its toll of the \"T-SE Index. Uncertainty over the timing of the next general election in the UK persisted, as the parlia- mentary opposition parties called for an early election and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, said yesterday he was in no hurry. The market's political sensitivities overshad owed any benefits from an 0>Â«Â»Â« O-HMI-- N Sep 2 Sep10 830 Sp 12 Sep 26 Oct 10 iLad DNuN Sep13 Sep 2 Oct 11 Sep23 Oct 7 Oct21 optimistic report on business confidence from the Institute of Directors. The chief talking point was the warning from the board- room of British Aerospace that its 1991 profits would be signifi- cantly lower than estimates published in the UK weekend press. With the market, and the UK press, also suggesting that BAe might include a heavy rights issue call in its interim report, due tomorrow, BAe shares fell sharply, and helped to discourage equities. Nor was the mood helped by the temporary suspension of shares in Babcock Prebon, the London-based international money broker. However, trading volume across the broad range of the -arket was modest. The day's all of 14.2 to 2,653.2 on the -F-SE Index reflected turnover of only 345.8m shares, com- pared with 504.6m on Friday. Some retailing issues edged higher in the second half of the session, responding to the dis closure of revised UK retail sales for July that show a gain of 0.7 per cent compared with the originally estimated rise of 0.3 per cent, providing fresh evidence that the recession in the UK may be slackening. A few speculative issues, not4bly Cadbury Schweppes, found buyers, and Reed Inter- natidnal, the paper and packag- ing group, provided a firm sea- ture. But the shadow of the dollar lay across such interna- tional names as ICI, Glaxo and Reuters, while the leading oil issues ended the session a few pence off. Some of the selling of the international leaders was blamed on a Japanese securi- ties house which last week advised clients to \"sell the market\". Other securities houses have also suggested that, with base rates likely to fall by no more than another nalf-point in the near term, the UK stock market may find it hard to make further progress this year. However, Hoare Govett was among those to stress that the market is unlikely to give much ground as signs of an economic recovery become more clear, \"buy on any set- back\" Is the firm's view. Yesterday's revised July sales figures raised the curtain on a week of important eco- nomic data from both sides of the Atlantic. Today brings the UK producer price statis- tics, to be followed on Thurs- day by employment and earn- ings figures, and on Friday by the retail price index for August. The week is also featured by profits announcements from some of the largest UK compa- nies, including Glaxo, Legal& General, Prudential and Rolls-Royce. Consequently, fund managers have every incentive to hold back from investment just at present. FINANCIAL TIMM STOCK INDICES t S1 Sept.

   "text_content" : "BRITISH Aerospace hit its lowest level for more than a year after the company sur- prised the market with a prof- its warning. At the end of trad- ing the shares were down 37 at 518p, their low for the day, after above-average turnover of 5m shares. The company said full-year profits would be well below the estimates (around Â£300m and above) mentioned in the week- end press. The statement, how- ever, made no mention of the much-leaked rights issue expected to be announced with tomorrow's interim results. Analysts were left in the dark about the warning and the rights issue as calls to the company yielded no further information. Speculation became the order of the day. Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull said he was not surprised by the warning and had long suspected the company would need to call on investors for cash. He added: \"I believe the warning implies a major write-off, not trading dif- ficulties. Something has gone wrong, probably in Forex or leasing. A rights issue will not solve the company's long-term problems and it is likely to come back to the market in a few years' time.\" Mr Peter Deighton at County NatWest said: \"There was probably a rights issue in the frame for Wednesday on the assumption that the market had a good grip on profit expectations. The realisation that some figures appear to be above the Â£300m mark pan- icked them.\" Tomorrow's inter- ims are expected to be in the region of Â£90m to Â£100m. Persimmon deal In one of the day's biggest equity deals, Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, carried out a bought deal in Persim- mon shares, involving the sale of 5m by Mr Duncan Davidson, the Persimmon chairman and chief executive, and Mrs S. Davidson. The disposal left the directors' joint holdings at 20.64 per cent. The Seaq delayed ticker revealed trades of 5m Persim- mon shares at 285p and 4.7m at 287%'p, indicating the broker had taken a 2'%p turn on the shares. The share price edged up during early trading but subsequently declined to finish 3 off on balance at 291p. Persimmon, one of the top ten housebuilders in the UK, revealed a near 20 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Â£12.5m last week. Optimism at Reed Reed International, the pub- lishing group, was the best per- forming stock in the FT-SE 100 index yesterday as hopes grew of a recovery in UK advertis- ing. The shares finished 10 bet- ter on balance at 488p. The stock began on a posi tive note as it decisively broke away from the important chart point of 477p, a level which it has already made five separate attempts to break through. Kleinwort Benson's reitera- tion of its buy stance also helped the shares. But it was reports in the press of improve ment in advertising that prc pelled the shares to their highest level since the crash of 1987. Better than expected July retail sales figures provided support for the stores sector. The detailed breakdown of the numbers, which showed a monthly increase of 15 per cent in home improvements sales, lifted Kingfisher 3 to 574p and Boots 3 to 439p. Laura Ashley added 9 at 88p after analysts went away impressed after a meeting with Mr Jim Maxmin, the new chief executive. Cadbury Schweppes rose 6 to 402p after further speculation in the press about a bid from Philip Morris, of the US. There was also excitement ahead of its interim results due tomor- row. Profits of around Â£ll0m, against Â£104.7m last time, are expected. Northern Foods advanced 9 to 534p on renewed talk that it may be about to enter the FT-SE 100 index. Legal& General eased 2 to 440p and Prudential 5 to 256p ahead of interim figures sched- uled for later this week. BZW expects L&G to increase the interim by 7 per cent to 6.3p and Prudential to lift its pay- ment by 9 per cent to 3.8p. The broker has pencilled in a Â£103.8m loss for L&G, to accommodate substantial reserves for its mortgage indemnity business, and pre- dicts that Prudential will pro- duce pre-tax profits of Â£166.7m, up from last time's Â£126.7m. British Telecom lost 5 to 3931'/p, with the market said to be uncomfortable at the pros- pect of a postponement of the sale of the government's remaining near 48 per cent stake in the company if a November general election takes place. First Leisure ran up 8 to 279p following a straight buy recommendation from Pan- mure Gordon and suggestions of switching into the shares from other leisure stocks. Rolls-Royce eased 3% to 139%p on turnover of 4.8m after BMW, which has a stake of around 2 per cent in the company, denied weekend press reports in the UK that the German firm planned to strengthen its links with R-R. An increased dividend together with interim figures only slightly lower than a year earlier lifted Fairey Group 4 to 313p. T & N was a firm market. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NMw m O (Ia).

BET was one of the day's heavy turnover stocks. It bene- sited from good two-way busi- ness as some investors took profits while others saw the company as a good recovery buy. The shares firmed a half- penny to 222p on a turnover of 4.1m. A positive annual meeting helped Siebe to continue its strong performance and close 13 up at 546p. The shares have risen 150p since June. Wassail responded to posi- tive comment and hardened 4 to 181p. Securities house Klein- wort Benson sees it as a buy. Serco, the thinly traded task management contractor, gained 8 to 515p. It has per- formed well since announcing a 23 per cent boost in interim profits at the end of August. Anticipation that Courtaulds would hold an analysts meet- ing before the end of the month that might carry an upbeat statement helped the shares to gain 4 to 499p. Half-time results from Brit- ish Vita were in line with expectations and the shares lost a penny to 250p. Laporte saw a touch of ner- vousness ahead of half-year fig- ures due on September 19 and slipped 11 to 579p in very thin trading. International issues suffered as a weak dollar cast its shadow and investors took profits. Glaxo, which reports full-year results on Thursday, fell 15 to 1366p. The shares had already risen sharply in antici- pation of strong results and this was considered as slightly overdone. Reuters, which staged a strong advance last week on talk that problems with the company's two new dealing systems could soon be resolved, lost its bounce and slipped back through the 900p barrier to close 11 off at 894p. In spite of the announcement of a Â£90m disposal, ICI retreated 14 to 1326p. Reckitt &Colman, which was gloomy about prospects at its interim results meeting last week, weakened 15 to 696p. BAT receded 9 to 681p. The modest assessment by stockbroker Strauss Turnbull of BP's exploration success in Colombia continued to hold back the shares, which settled 2 cheaper at 344p. But it was pointed out that the sector had generally been restrained by estimates that Opec output during August had increased to 22.5m barrels a day from July's 22.3m. Suggestions in the weekend press that the company's man- agement may be looking at a buy-out drove Premier Consoli- dated up to 39p, before a more considered view that such a move was unlikely left the stock only marginally ahead at 37'/Ap. Recently depressed Ultramar put on 5 to 271p after a handful of institutional supporters of the shares appeared. MARKT BRPORTVRS Peter John, Joel Kibazo, Jim McCallum, Steve Thompson.
