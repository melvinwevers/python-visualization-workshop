   "article_dc_title" : "Scarcer Funds for Mortgages",
   "text_content" : "By Our Commercial Editor The marked shortage of mortgage funds now seems likely to be Intensified by the end of this year. This is partly a consequence of yesterday's decision by the Building Societies Association to recommend its members to defer the rise in mortgage rates from 6j per cent, to 71 per cent. until January 1. Members who follow this recommendation will effec- tively tie their own hands until the end of the year on the rates they offer to investors, since the present structure gives virtually no margin for a rise. Mr. Donald Gould, chairman of the Association, said yesterday that he expected the movement to find itself under heavy pressure to offer a rise \" later this year.\" This might mean a second rise in the mortgage rate-conceivably to 71 per cent.-to come into force next March. Meanwhile the inflow of in- vestment funds to the movement fell from Â£49.8m. in July to Â£40.9m. in August. This is con- siderably greater than the normal seasonal drop. The experience of the first quarter of 1965-thp last occasion on which the movement persisted in offering well below Ihe market rate, at the direct request of the Chancellor-was that the net flow fell to a low point of Â£16m. in March and averaged ogly Â£22.5m. for the four months before the rate was raised. Bleak Short-term Outlook It is possible that a number of societies will escape this dilemma by ignoring the Association's recommendation - Mr. Gould made an unusual parade yesterday of the fact that it is not binding on members but the biggest societies, who do the great bulk of the business, seem certain to kceep their ranks closed. A few of the smaller ones may be unable to do so even if they wi.. sicp. they eport. that they hav.\"*refently been unable to attract any net funds from the investing public. Mr. Gould .is frank about the bleak short-term outlook for mortgage advaaces. The move- ment, he said, had an \"over. whelming economic case\" for an immediate rise. But the Govern. ment wanted a pause, and since most societies could readily enough afford to wait a few months (liquid funds average some 15 per cent. of assets) they felt bound to do so. The Government's Wishes Mr. Richard Crossman, in his last letter to the Association as Minister of Housing, had. In fact, asked for a deferment of the rise, but had added that \"he did not want to suggest a course of action which would jeopardise the sow of funds for home ownership.\" \"That,\" Mr. Gould commented, \"seems a bit ridiculous.\" But it was clear that the Government wanted a delay, and the Association had complied. Mr. Crossman's successor, Mr, Anthony Greenwood, confirmed the torce next March. Association's reading of the Government's mind yesterday by congratulating the Council on its decision. The August figures for the movement, issued just before the meeting, made it clear how tight the situation has become. The Â£40.9m. net investment together with Â£52.3m. in repay- ments on existing mortgages and Â£0.7m. in interest re-invested. brought in a total of Â£93.9m. But new advances were Â£118.3m., which meant a call of more than Â£24m. on liquid funds. For the rest of the year the socie- ties are already committed to a further Â£320m. in new advances. This would take more than 85 per cent. of the new funds available if the August inflow were maintained. If the experience of 1965 were re- peated new funds by the end of the year would be inadequate to meet even the promises already made. Bound to Affect New Starts The hortage of funds is already having its impact not only on current house sales but oni fut.vt diveropment. Snome societies feel unable to take on their usual com- mitments to finance future hous- ing developments. This seems bound to affect new starts even on developments for which builders feel confident of a ready market. It is the first time in the present squeeze that the mortgage situa- tion has had serious direct impact on new developments: until now, the difficulties have risen largely through the shortage of funds in the secondhand market, which has had a chain reaction in the -ales of new houses.

African Control Here, too, Mr, Pearson suggested a compromise which implied African control in Rhodesia by the time of independence, but stopping short of one man, one vote. He asked Mr. Wilson foi reasuraaces that independence would only be granted if-there was effctive electoral representation of the majority of the population, which would be extended to all adults as soon as possible after independence. Mr. Pearson also had a kind word for Zambia. He said Canada had been studying the possibility of additional emergency aid to Zambia, and hoped for agreement on the British Â£14m, aid offer, which is hanging fire. The Canadian Prime Minister distributed his epigrams impartially. He said the Commonwealth had become accustomed to calling a spade a spade. and sometimes more than that, and he condemned the white minority in Rhodesia for its feudal obstinacy; it was worse than a crime, it was a blunder.

   "text_content" : "By LEX After losing its confidence on Thursday the market regained enough of it yesterday to stop the slide, and with the help of some bear closing the index finished up 0.5 better at 300.9. The firm- ness of the leaders, however, did not carry through to second-line stocks and in Industrials falls outnumbered rises by 5 to 1. Low Ebb It has not been an easy week for equities. After starting better, first the Prime Minister's TUC speech, then Dr. Verwoerd's assassination and finally ICI's half-year state- ment have helped turn the market back and the index is 6.3 down on the week. But prices are not being fully tested-Thursday was the quietest normal business day since March 1958 and the week's total of 37,762 bargains is the lowest for a non-holiday week since January 24, 1958. There are several reasons for thinking the market could be steadier now. ICI is out of the way and its dividend out of doubt, thus removing one source of hysteria. Secondly the market is getting accustomed to a diet of bad rather than good news and share prices should have antici- pated anything but the exceptional shock. Moreover the institutions' need for equities it providing some- thing of a floor at just below current levels, while digesting the ICI loan stock will have its effect on gilts rather than equities. Of course the case for a rise is still as nebulous as ever unless the U.S. administration grasps the tax nettle firmly and allows interest rates to move down again, but this is un- likely to happen before the U.S. elections in November. BOAC-Cunard BOAC-Cunard's 1965-66 results show just why Cunard is hanging on to this particular investment so tenaciously. Revenue increased 13 per cent to Â£41.4m. but pre- tax profits are, Â£5.12M. a9g Â£4.25m. '9ar61uslodia 2.2 points frorm- iaNvestmrnent-ulwaieel cne out at 13.2 per cent, but the 'divi- dend is unchanged at 6 per cent., the minimum allowed. This still means Cunard is effectively earning 10 per cent. pre-tax on its 30 per cent. stake which is a rate of return not even dreamed of in the rest of the group. More to the point at 12s Cunard are selling at just 8.6 times Cunard's attributable slice of BOAC-Cunard's earnings, leaving any chance of eliminating the shipping losses in the price for nothing. It is no good putting a fancier multiple than this on a minority stake in a company which both the Government and the majority partner would love to see dissolved. But given its record a 8.6 P/E ratio is not that unreason- able, and with Â£7.1m, of liquid assets-mostly as interest free deposits with its parents-BOAC. Cunard should be able to afford the ante for the Jumbo Jet era. On this basis shareholders whn me. staying for the ride in the hope that Cunard can eventually put right both the passenger side and its cash problem are hardly risking their shirt. See also Page 10 Rolls-BSE Rolls-Royce was certain to be in confident form in the formal offer for BSE if only to give the con- vertible loan stock-first convers sion price 45s Sd in 1968-some- thing to bite on. The group is stay- ing coy about profits, presumably cause they tend to fluctuate with r. and d. and not all orders are yet rock firm, but there is no reticence about sales. Rolls alone will see a rise from the present Â£126m. to over Â£200m. in 1968 though BSB will have to be content with a com- partively modest advance from around Â£90m. to Â£100m. Secondly, there have been some \"adjust- ments \" to BSE's profits which have produced a useful additional rise of Â£660,000 or so in 1965 and bounced the profits up to Â£6.37m. in 1966. The effect is to improve Rolls' profits cum BSE to Â£12.8m. and earnings to 16 per cent., making the prospective price-earnings ratio 13Y times at 43s 4Yd. The share price has had Its ups and downs over the last week, at one time it was down to 41s 9d, but these latest forecasts should put a strong floor under it at the current level. Nor does the Â£7.9m. overdraft change the picture. Admittedly Rolls has been no slug- gard in using the market this year -the Â£21.7m. rights and debenture issue last March and currently a Â£20m. debenture and Â£3m. con- vertible-but it is now cum assets, through Bristol Aeroplane, it does does not want, Nor is there any pussyfooting about it. Rolls says quite bltttly said it does not want to \" participate in the affairs of air- craft constructors \" which can only mean that sooner or later the 1 per cent. holding in Westland worth Â£2.1m. and the 20 per cent. stake in BAC will go to the benefit of liquidity, See also IaFep 0 - bhe Dobson Hardwick report must be one of the very first to follow the Stock Exchange's new guidelines which came into effect on September 1. There are three crucial additions. First it is stated that the directors' service agree* ments will be available for inspec- tion until October 3 at the head office. Secondly, details of all In- siders' dealings in the shares during the last year will also be available during that period. Finally the ren Port lists the current shareholdings of the board, Including their family interests, for investors merely in- terested in movements from year to year and the extent or otherwise of director control. These are all excellent innovations and while in theory only binding on companies seeking a quotation for new shares, hould be followed by everyone. After all only companies with something to hide need to keep this Information from their share- holders.

   "article_dc_title" : "Sharp Setback in Equities on ICI Interim Statement",
   "text_content" : "THE FIRST WEEK of the new etS c PEchanea Accnunt has brought a return of disturbed and depressed conditions to the equity market, mainly on di\"- i couraging news from the com- a p any world, notably from ci Imperial Chemical Industries, it the colossus of UX. industry. it On the week, THa FINANCUAL tc TIMES Industrial Ordinary share d index has fallen 6.1 to 301.1, ti after rising 2.7 to 309.9 on p Monday. sl 14 South African f Shock t ti The shock of the assassination u of Dr. Verwoerd was a factor on M Tuesday in the start of the setback, a but Wednesday saw a return to firm conditions (particularly in South African securities). Follow- ing the statement of ICI and, to a lesser extent, those of AEI and London Brick, marked weakness e developed in equities on Thursday, t when the share index suffered its biggest loss (8.8) since end-1964. Some resistance at the lower levels developed in the leaders yesterday, although second-rank stocks were still dull. AEI, which is, of course, another industrial giant, makes the point that Government measures are in- creasingly affecting business condi- tions, \"which are expected to become progressively more difficult during the next few months.\" London Brick, by far the largest brick manufacturer in the country, reports a trading profit for the first half of 1966 of Â£1.44m., against Â£2.37m. in the corresponding half of 1965 and Â£1.67m. in the second half of that year. Selling has not been heavy. This follows almost automatically from the extremely low level to which Stock Exchange business has fallen. But the buyers have withdrawn or lowered their limits, and jobbers have been more anxious to sell stock than to buy it. A Â£60m. Loan Issue From ICI The big surprise of the week was i produced by Imperial Chemical Industries in the shape of a Â£60m. 8 per cent. Unsecured Loan stock, 1988-93, at Â£98 per cent. This mammoth issue had the instant i effect of depressing gilt-edged and fixed-interest stocks generally. The money will be required for the company's big capital programme, which should bring it material bene- fits within the next few years, evidently not as soon as budgeted for. The Board makes the point that, in the meantime, the Govern- ment's severe credit restrictions are already having a material effect on the company's customers and, con- sequently, on the company's profits. Profits, before tax, for the first half-year have fallen from Â£56m. to Â£51m., much as expected. Com- ______ __ parison is with the first half of 1965. If pre-tax profits turn out to be the L91m. (Â£10m. less than in 1965) which the board thinks likely, the 1966 dividend of ICI, if it is main. tained at 12% per cent, would be covered about 1.1 times, bearint in mind that income-tax on part or it will not have had to be paid over to the Inland Revenue. When the dividend bean income-tax fully, cover would fall to about once on thee figures. It is an unsatisfactory position for a company of IC's standing and helps to explain why ICI has to rely so heavily on the new capital market to cover the cost of its expansion. Nevertheless, the dividend looks secure for some time ahead, provided profits hold up. ICI have lost 7%d on the week at 36s 7%d, after 35s 7%d, and now offer a 6.8 per cent. yield. As a Trust Chief Sees the Outlook Mr. Alan L Brown, chairman of one of the biggest of the Scot. tish investment trust groups, goes on record this week as gloomy 370 - 36 -- -- -- - --- - - - 310 -------- I--- -- - The Finanolal Times INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL ORDINARY SHARES 290 --- - -6LL11-HII J F MAMJJAS ON D J F MAMJ J As about the prospect. In his state ment as chairman of Second Alliae Trust-investment port- folio Â£25%m.-he says \"I feel bound to describe the immediate outlook as the worst for many years.\" He is, of course, referring to the earnings and dividend pros pect for industrial companies. The measures of restraint, coupled with those aimed specifically at in- dustrial earnings and dividends, mean that U.K. dividends can only move in one direction-down. This is, of course, what the stock mar- ket has been discounting. Even in the United States, where the Board expects the pace of divi- dend increases to slacken, there are clear signs of strain, he says. Nevertheless, he believes it should be possible to maintain the current distribution of Second Alliance of 16% per cent.-covered 1.1 times. Because of the Board's belief in \" a serious and possibly protracted reversal of the long period of rising 9rofits,\" it has retreated still further romn the position of almost 100 per cent. investment in equities. Fixed-interest holdings have been i raised from 6 per cent. to 7.8 per ) cent. The proportion of U.S. hold- Sings has been reduced from 45.9 per cent. to 43.4 per cent Second s Alliance are now quoted at 18s. SDividend Warning From Murex Â· Distrust of the dividend prospect of Morex, the metallurgists, has * been evident for some time in the Shigh yield of 8.8 per cent. at 29s 6d a offering on the shares prior to 0 publication of the chairman's divi- , dend warning; since the warning, . the yield has gone out to 10 per 4 cent. at 25s 6d. Corporation tax c is a main problem. While profits I were maintained at Â£1.15m., the i: Board makes the comment that, but for the transitional tax relief on the dividend, it is doubtful if the 13 per cent. rate of dividend would have been maintained. Capital ex- penditure and stocks required re- a sources. Now, the Board is taking t- the line that, in view of the furthet *s economic measures taken by the y Government. a difficult period lies thead. The continuing high level )f taxation and the need to retain idequate resources may well, there- rore, necessitate a reduction in the present rate of dividend. Like its profits, the dividend of Murex has auctuated-up and down-over the years. Actually, the prospect does rot sound too bad in the light of lhe Board statement that the period .f difficulty could well have a reater effect on the profits of the parent company than on those of the subsidiary, Murex Welding Pro- esses, which has been contributing an increasing proportion to group profits. Davy-Ashmore Doing Much Better If Davy.Ashmore earns lÂ£%m., before tax, this year, as the direc- tor now expect, this would provide a cover of about 1.6 times for an 11. per cent. dividend. This was the rate paid last year, and presumi ably the chairman's expectation that the dividend recommendation this year will be conservative at least allows holders to hope that the 11 per cent. rate will be main- tained. This is a great change of fortune, as last year's pre-tax profit of Â£570,000 (against Â£759,000) would not have been adequate to cover the dividend (costing about Â£593,000 gross). However, the immediate future remains rather imponderable. The group depends for its profits mainly on the Power-Gas Corporation (engineering and supply of gas and chemical plants) and Davy and United Engineering and Ashmore. Benson, Pease (providing iron and steel-works plant). Power-Gas has turned the corner, made a good profit last year, and is expected to do even better. Un- fortunately, the steel plant com- panies are more or less standing still and look like being in this position for some time. In the longer-term, however-and this may be some years ahead-they stand to benefit substantially if sea- board steel plants are established in this country, to make steel on a large scale from rich raw materials brought by sea, this is a possibility. Davy.Ashmore holders have to be patient. At 9s 44d, the shares now yield 5.9 per cent Fairey Hopes For The Future Shareholders of the Fairey Com pany will still have to wait until the interim report is published (presumably next February) for as indication from the Board of the likely results for the current year. In 1965-66, the group trading profit, after tax, slumped from Â£614,00( to Â£241,000, and the dividend wai cut from 25 per cent. to 10 pei cent. The Board has taken steps to rectify the position, and while the) are trying for an improvement this year. they believe it to be more likely that the fuller effect will be seen in 1967-68. The main fall in profits was over- seas-from Â£925,000 to Â£364,000 -almost entirely in the Belgian company as a result of the comple- tion of the Starfighter contract. A decision is expected within the next months regarding a replacement aircraft which should give some four years' work to the aircraft manufacturing division. At home, the Â£120,000 reduction in profit arose mainly because the major U.K. subsidiary, Fairey Engineer- ing. traded at a loss because of under-utilisation of facilities and losses on contracts taken to fill the gap. The Board still believes that the long-term prospects of the group remain favourable, subject to the general position. Fairey have fallen back to 14s 3d this week. Onlooker",

   "text_content" : "THE WILDCAT strike or Zambian mineworkers on the Copperbelt is all but over. Throughout the week the number of miners returning to work progressively increased until only the Mufulira mine, where the strike originally started, is reported to be still idle. With the prospect of a full re. sumption in supplies from Zambia, London Metal Exchange prices have of course fallen. The cash price of wirebars closed last night at Â£393, a loss of Â£4 10s on the week. The fall has been tempered by the fact that if LME prices were just below current levels, it would be profitable to buy copper here and sell It in the U.S., where the supply situation appears to be as tight as ever. The absence of any easing In U.S. demand was emphasised by Wednesday's news that two U.S. producers had raised their domestic copper by 2 cents to 38 cents a pound. It remains to be seon whether other U.S. producers wTll follow or whether President John. nson will persuade the two producers to rescind the increase as he did last year. Tin has been a quiet market this week. The International Tin Council is meeting In Kinshasa but is not expected to take any doo. sions affecting world prices. SUGAR-The London Daily Price of sunoar reached *an Â·Â· Â·I LI~ L1__ Price of sugar reached an, By Our Commodities Staff other post-war low this week when it fell by 15 to Â£14 10s a too. Over-production, large world stooks and the lack of any ignificant buying interest, gives little hope of a revival for some time to come. If it were not for our own Commonwealth Sugar Agree- ment and certain similar arrange. ments between other countries and producers, the situation would he even worse than it is now. These arrangements at least ensure that a large proportion of output is bought at a price which covers pro- ductlon costs and more, but at the present time the price received for the balance of the crop not subject to seiolal terms severely dissipates total earnings, In some countries the present free market price represents only about one-third of actual production coats. In London recently, Common- wealth sugar producers held discus* sions to try to pave the way for an international sugar agreement, and decided the minimum export quotas they would accept when the pre- paratory working group of UNCTAD resumes meetings on September 26. It is now vitally necessary to restrict sales, for a start, to bring supply in line with demand under a full international agreement. The coffee producers with similLr prob* lems. have an effective pact which limits exports under a quota system and has kept prices at sensible levels. This agreement was further strengthened at the recent meeting of the International Coffee Council. BACON-\" Pirst hand\" bacon prices on the London Provision Exchan g fell away from their recent high levels this week-Ulster bacon lost 18 to 310s a cwt. and Danish A 5I to 325s a cwt, for instance, The drop was partly due to a reduction in demand fiom the coastal resorts as the holiday season tails off as well as some consumer resistance to high prices. The reduction was welcomed by the Ministry of Agriculture, which expressed the hope that the enefnti will now be passed on to the con- sumer, with the keenly competitive grocery chains leading the way,",

   "text_content" : "By Our WaiO Street Correspondent n at at 3- It Bt in id re 1e Ly in Id d c. ad ar,. id n- ng us be Uls ey a- ed a In he THE STOCK MARKET, which was shortened by one trading session because of the Labour Day holiday, meandered aimlessly for most of the week. Its performance was governed by the factors which have been taxing Wall Street for several months past-tight money, high interest rates and general un- certainty over Washington's apparent indifference to the strains on the economy. At the close of trading yester- day, thp Dow Jones Industrial Average - at 775.55 - showed a gain on the day of 0.67 points. However, the Index showed a loss on the week of 12.14 points com- pared with a rise of 7.13 points during the previous week. Much uncertainty was dispelled on Thursday afternoon, after the markets closed, by President Johnson's specific request for a clowing-down of the booming economy. To some observers it almost seemed as if the President was responding to the warnings of the International Monetary Pund earlier in the week that ame U.S. economy should be dampened. President Johnson's most impor- tant request called for the temporary elimination of the 7 per cent investment credit and of accelerated depreciation. Both these requests are aimed primarily at slowing down expenditures for capital equipment and should be particularly deprpssing on the manufacturers of machinery, trans port equipment rnd new plants. Although car sales in late August were 2 per cent. higher than a year earlier, sales for the month as a whole were down 4 per cent., with General Motors off 9.5 per cent. for the month, Ford up 2.1 per cent. and Chrysler up 8.3 per cent. Cat shares showed some tendencies towards consolidation and traded above their lows of recent months Many of the hih fliers were weaker, with sellng in the- issues attributed by brokers t mutual funds anxious to lock ut profits for the year. Aircraft Order Individual features includec Trans-World Airlines, which w& weaker after announcing that I would order 28 airliners word S410m., with 12 of them Boeiln 747s, which are designed to carr 350 to 490 passengers. Wal Street thinking was that equif financing might be necessary t carry out these ambitions. Thi game news helped Boeing an a United Aircraft, the prime man% r facturers of the equipment. McKesson and Robbins move up in reaction to a purchase off for 550,000 shares at S53 by Pore",

   "text_content" : "PARIS-The week ended irregularly, with a few on-balance gains. Easiness early in the week sent the official daily index, to a three-months' low. Institutional and other buying attracted by the low levels was not maintained. Golds reacted sharply to the assassination of the South African Premier, but losses were partly recovered later. Among French issues, CGE closed at Frs.527 (against Frs.540), CSF at Frs.150.50 (Frs.146.50), Machines Bull at Frs.138.20 (Frs.135.10), Michelin at Frs.858 (Frs.870), P6chlney Frs.193 (Frs.198.20), and PeugeotFrs.128.20 (Frs.133.90). AMSTERDAM - International issues were strong and very active late this week, reflecting Wall Street's gains and bear-covering, with a modest local private inves- tor buying. Royal Dutch recovered from early weakness, mainly on foreign selling, to close Fls.4.35 higher at Fls.116.50, while Unilever rose Fls.8.05 to Fls.81.95, Philips Fls.6.55 to Fls.91.60, Hoogovens 16 points to Fls.306 and AKU Fls.6.55 to Fls.61.90. MILAN-The market wat idle, with trading around the year's lowest and prices showing little change. Professional operators were undecided, sources said, and the public was reserved. Major gainers included Medio- banca at lire 76,980 (lire 75,290), Falck lire 3,900 (lire 3,760), Don- zell lire 4,690 (lire 3,580), Molbla Certon lire 2,940 (lire 2,815) and Monte Amists lim 15,590 (lire 15,325). Weaker issues included Tecnomasio at lire 1,425 (lire 1,480) and Cucldra at lire 7,050 (lire 7,200). Leading issues moved nar- rowly, with Montecatini at lire 1,844 (against lire 1,830) and Flat at lire 2,770 (against lire 2,775). Edison was lire 2.841 (against lire 2,825). ZURICH-The market was steadier towards the end of the week, reflecting some buying by investors who took a more opti- mistic view of Wall Street after the President's announcement of economic measures. Interhandel rose Sw.Frs.80 to Sw.Frs.3.960, and Bankgesellschaft which has a large stake in the company, was up Sw.Frs.25 at Sw.Frs.2,510. -Chemicals were lower over the week with Ciba registered off Sw.Frs.235 at Sw.Frs.4,775, Gelgy registered down Sw.Frs.l05 at Sw.Frs.2,610 and Sandoz off Sw.Frs.200 at Sw.Frs.4.950. Alatslsse lost Sw.Frs.140 at Sw.Frs.5,300. FRANKFURT-The market ral- lied towards the end of the week, with buying by private investors overc -ming early listlessness. Chemical and electrical issues were the main gainers; a drying-up of earlier foreign selling was also noticed. Bayer rose DM9% to DM289. Anilin DM8 to DM398 and Farb. werke Hoechst DM5 to DM400. Siemens was up DM9 at DM365 and AEG up DM5 to DM346. Daimler rose DM9Y to DM460, and BMW DM2% to DM273, but Volkswagen fell DM1 to DM381 and NSU was off DM5% to nTMtAUM",

After Thursday's sharp setback on the discouraging ICI interim statement, equity leaders on the Stock Exchange yesterday dis- played a much steadier appearance, and THE F*IANCIA. TiMES Indus- trial Ordinary share index rose 0.5 to 300.9. ICI themselves, which had led the decline on Thursday, were in the van of the small rally with a gain of Is at 36s 7!yd. Recently-issued debentures and Loan stocks continued a rather dull market, still on the prospect ,f competition from ICI's f60m. Loan stock bearing an 8 per cent. coupon. A little investment bargain- hunting and bear closing at the end of the week were responsible for the steadier tone of the leaders, after an early small marking-down had been shown to be unjustified as sellers were few. Outside the ranks of the leaders, dullness was still the order of the day, however, as can be seen from the 30 per cent. falls in all F.T.-quoted Industrials against 6 per cent rises. After their good rally of the revious two days following Tuesday's slump on ithe assassina- tion of Dr. Verwoerd, South African gold mines fell back a little. Volume generally on the Stock Exchange yesterday con- tinued at a low level, although bargains marked at 7,511 were better - than Thursday's 6,579; a week ago, the total was 8,304. This week's bargains total di 37,762 is the lowest for about 8%Y years, namely, since the week ended January 24, 1958, when the total was 35,806 and when the. country was also in an economic crisis; the comparison excludes holiday periods. British Funds Quiet The planned Â£60m. I.C.I. Loan stock issue continued to overshadow the market in British Funds, and dealers reported an extremely quiet day's trading with prices of longer- dated issues again easing by A or * in places. Feadnla 31 per cent., 1999- 1004 was the latter fraction down at 53*, while War Loan 3* per cent. also ended I easier at 48k. The \"shorts,\" however. continued to attract public and professional buy- ing. Exchequer 5 per cent., 1967, was particularly favoured, and rose A more to 97*. Reflecting the competitive terms of the new I.C.I. loan, Corporation loans showed scattered falls of *, but actual selling was small. Largely reflecting renewed weak- ness m the dollar oremium, which ended 1I down at 171 per cent., after 17& per cent., Dollar stocks fell back on a broad front. After easing on small selling at the start, Insurances picked up to close with small mixed ovements on the day. General Acdmat ended a few pence better at 42s 6d, after 41s 104, but Eae Star closed 3d off at 49s d after 4 ld.

Other Chemicals closed with small losses. Lawes declined 6d to 17s. while Releshold were again dull and shed 3d further to 10s 9d. Contractors' shares opened easier, but picked uD to close with little alteration on the day. Elsewhere in the Building group, Tunnel Portland \"B\" declined 9d to 31s 9d and Marshal's (Halifax) lost a similar amount to 7s. Shanks, 29s, and Concrete, 20s 9d, lost is 6d and 71d respectively. Rank Organisation picked up 71d to 27s. with the \"A\" shares Is better at 26s 9d. Press comment influenced a rise of 5s to 205s in A. Kershaw. Helped by Press assessment of thi half-yearly results, AEI, at 39s 6d, regained Is of Thursday's late 2s fall, which followed first reactions to the company's interim report. A. Reyrolle, however, ended Is easier at 46s after their interim results. Thorn Ordinary declined 9d more to 63s, while Crabtree Electrical were similarly lower at 29s. Philips' Lamp recovered 2s 6d to 84s 6d. In first- time dealings, Carbon Electric 84 per cent. debentures, 1988-93, were being quoted at 98, compared with the recent placing price of 98*. Stores shares generally presented a steadier appearance but Empire Stores were on offer, and fell Is 3d to 30s lid. Philip Kualek were lowered 9d to 13s on news that the earlier proposed increase in dividend had been rescinded to comply with the Government's request on dividends. Leading Engineers took on a 3etter apearance after Thursday's Ktback. 8unet Keen picked up Is to 5s 3d. and Tube Iaveulata rallied id to 52s 6d. while A. Herbert were Id better at 5f.

Glazo Group rallied 41d to 36s 7d, while a similar recovery was seen in Unilever at 28a lid. BDH Group, however, eased 3d to 20s lid. after the half-yearly results. while Bury Maseo declined a like amount to Ils 9d. following the interim statement. Other dull spots included Was.

Call ing was substantial, once more, with both clearing and outside banks withdrawing sizeable amounts. A rate of 6f per cent. was bid for day-today loans for the best part, with smaler lins found from time to time at 6( per cent., and with money arising from official purchases of bills from the banks passed on to houses at 61 per cent., or used to buy November Treasury bills at 6 45-64ths per cent. Even in the closing staes there was no ap. preciable fall in rates, below 6* per cent.. and some houses were forced to pay 6* per cent. for late sums. Privilege arrangements were widely used in full. A certain business was done in Treasury bills, independentli of the official help, with November and Hot\" maturities quoted at 6 45-64ths per cent. for the best part, both before and after the tender-at which houses submitted an unchanged It 7*7 per cent., the lower level ipplying in each case to money for mmediate settlement. One month leposits were at 74 per cent., and 1-month at 71 per cent., while funds unning into January, or for six nonths were at 71 per cent. Mortgage ates were steady.

   "text_content" : "SHELL'S celebrated \" Make Money\" competition, which ends on September 14 with payments continuing until the 28th, is drawing to its close in a blaze of publicity-but nol the sort the company would have chosen. This week two ol the cut price companies. Jet anc European. found a way ol making use of its popularity tc help their sales in competitior with those of Shell itself. On Wednesday Jet announcec that it will give rebates of Ic a gallon on all its grades everl time a motorist presents one o the half notes. and on Thursdaj European promised to give 2t on any purchase. Europeal also promised to pay out the full face value on all left hani Â£100 and Â£10 notes sent to it Leytonstone headquarters be fore September 19. This gestur is unlikely to cost much sine these notes are very rare, ani most holders will have match ing ones. But the cost of th rebates to both Jet and Eurc pean may be substantial sinc the number of outstandin: notes now runs into man' millions. In fact the competition' popularity has been such the the company has been unabl to keep up with the demand so notes from some garages.

It is too early le to say whether or not gas has or been found in commercial quan- ey tities, but if it has the discovery id should have an important im- f nact nn the terms of the con- tracts, including the price. of all North Sea sas. The council and the finding companies are at present talk- ing about such technical matters as the date when deliveries can begin, and the amounts that will become available. But they will shortly move on to the vital matter of price, and the final terms are expected to be arranged within the next few weeks probably at the end of October. It is already certain that there will not be one fixed price. In- stead there will be a sliding scale designed to give a larger return to companies exploiting the smaller and less economic accumulations, and lower prices for the larger quantities. The Gas Council want the scale to be based on the cost plus theory, while the oil companies argue that the main considera- tion should be the prevailing price of competing forms of energy. It is therefore in the council's interest to be able to show that plenty of gas has already been discovered and can be exploited at relatively low cost. The oil companies for t their part emphasise the neces- f sity of their receiving an ade- quate rate of return, and the risk that subsequent wells may prove dry so that present esti- V mates of the amounts available will turn out to have been too",

   "text_content" : "THERE HAS BEEN little cheer for dry-cargo tramp ship- owners over the past few months. Rates have been at low and in many cases unprofitable levels and there are no signs yet of any substantial seasonal revival. In the transatlantic grain trades, in fact, tramp freights have fallen recently to their lowest levels in four years and the prospect of any worthwhile recovery in the near future is not bright. Demand from Euro- pean grain importers is well under the level of a year ago. Grain chartering in the trans- atlantic trades last month accounted for only about 1.3m. tons. compared with 2.7m. tons in August. 1965. Big bulk carriers now entering service are taking a great deal of this reduced business and are largely responsible for the de- pressed state of the Atlantic and other major trades. Three bulk carriers alone, for ex- ample. accounted for over 10 per cent. of last month's total transatlantic grain chartering. Tramp freight rates would have reached even lower levels recently if oil tanker \"raids\" on the grain trade had not been much lighter than a year ago. Tankers so far have accounted for only 2Y4m. tons of grain transport on the Atlantic since February. compared with 4%m. tons in the same period of 1965. Nevertheless, rates are now at such unattractive levels that tramp owners are beginning to lay-up ships rather than con- tinue to operate at a loss. According to the U.K. Chamber of Shipping. 65 dry-cargo ships totalling 331.459 gross tons were laid-up throughout the world at the beginning of Sep- tember. This was 82.000 tons higher than at August 1 and was the biggest laid-up total in ne rly four years. A revival in grain and ferti- liser bookings to India has caused a temporary shortage of conventional tramp ships in some trades and this in turn has led to an improvement in timecharter rates. The Cham- ber of Shipping's index (1960= I 100) was 136.1 in August, com- pared with 115.4 in July. The August index figure, however, is only marginally higher than in June and is below the levels in the earlier months of the year. Moreover, a good part of this demand for time-charter tramps I is limited, with cargo liner com- t panies showing no great interest. Charterers generally are not negotiating ships for period em- ployment because they see little r prospect of any marked re- a covery in tramp shipping a demand over the next few months. As a result, they feel there is less need to \" hedge \" s against a big recovery in freight I rates. I This time last year nearly 30 ships were engaged on time- i- charter for trading over varying s periods up to two years. and f about half of these were char- n tered by leading grain houses, n During August only one ship n was hired for employment over i. the period of a year and this 0 was taken by the Chinese.",

   "text_content" : "Rubber shares have looked a little better this week. with the in- dex up 1.7 at 104.76. However, the basic market malaise has not chaneed much. Prices are hardly being tested and there is not a great deal of stock coming out. Some buyers are being tempted back into the market by the higher yielding stocks, but the market is really waiting for the present thin flow of news to improve. The next big company should be Golden Hope, but not for a few weeks. Anglo-Oriental Brightest news of the week in rubbers has been the result of the poll among Anglo-Oriental share- holders following the meeting on September 2. On the question of whether to sell and liquidate or not, there was an overwhelming majority, roughly two to one. On the question of whether four of the present directors were to be removed or not, the resolutions were carried in 'each case but by a very much smaller majority. The two remaining Anglo-Oriental direc- tors have now resigned as well. Thus the Waterfall directors are left in control. There are two points to make about this result. First it looks to be the best solution. Moreover, it is encouraging that such a relatively drastic proposal by an outside group can win the day against strong established interests.- There was always the danger that what appeared to be a clear-cut issue, with all the advantages on one side would be defeated by shareholdei loyalty. After all the liquidatior issue has been brought to a beat largely by a change in taxation the consequences of which for a long time were not immediatela obvious. Now, however. Boards of direc tors can no loneer rely with a! much optimism on rallying share holders behind them iust on thi basis of the past record. It is harn to see the pressure falling off it future for other plantation com panies to realise their asset value since the damage corporation ta: does to their dividend paying capa- city has yet to be seen fully. On the other hand the onus is very much on the new directors of Anglo-Orlental to show that the assets can be realised for Ss a share and that doing so will not take an interminably long time. Teas Teas have been relatively quieter this week, but with a few more buyers around, both individuals and one or two institutions, and the index has ended up fraction- ally higher at 66.7. One disappointment of the week, however, is Western Dooars. Although the crop last year was marginally lower at 16.43m. against 16.66m. pounds, prices were better than average and Western Dooars looked to ;have a good chance of holding its dividend. But this optimism turns out to have been misplaced. The rise in costs upset the picture and the group's margins have shrunk from 4.4d pre-tax to 3.8d a pound, dropping profits from Â£304,000 to Â£258,000 and the dividend is cut from 11 to 9 per cent. The villain of the piece is over- spill relief. This has turned out to be rather less than seemed likely originally, but whether the posi- tion will improve this year is a vital question. There appears to be grounds for hoping it will, but presumably the chairman will enlarge on this question in his statement. Otherwise Western Dooars' prospects are not particu- larly exciting at present. Crops were only level-pegging in mid- August and current prices for Dooars are 2d a pound down- some drop with margins of less than 4d a pound. However, this year a very much smaller prooor* tion of the crop has been sold than at the same time in 1965-66. so there is still plenty of scope for im- provement. At any rate the share price is taking an optimistic view since at 13s 6d it is only 9d down on the week and yields 14.4 per cent",

   "text_content" : "UVA nun MTNING IDITOR THERE COULD have been no greater evidence than this week's behaviour of the Kafir market that a genuine demand, internationally based, exists for Gold shares at the present time owing to their attractions as a hedge againct currency weak- nesses nd economic freezes and squeezes. Few would have cared to forecast on Tuesday night that prices would have recovered so strongly after the shock wave caused by Dr. Verwoerd's assassination that Anglo-Amerl* can Corporation. which fell 23s 9d on Tuesday afternoon, would have recovered the whole of this loss by Thursday after- noon. Late on Tuesday afternoon itself buyers were, In fact, com- ing in at the heavily marked down levels and finding it diffi- cult to get stock. Even the Johannesburg market, a fairly consistent seller in recent months. was not disposed to offer shares It is interesting to note that not since 1963 has there been an upsurge in Gold shares in front of the September meet- ings of the world's monetary authorities. In 1964 it was not until October that the market turned upwards in a bull move- ment that lasted until March, 1965. Last year a bear phase started at the beginning of August the possible low point of which was reached at the end of last month. If a new bull movement is indeed now getting under way then it will once again have been preceded in classically historical fashion by a rise in the mining finance house shares which have been moving strongly upwards for some time now. OFS Dividends Meanwhile. the latest batch of dividends from the Orange Free State gold mines may generally be regarded as satis- factory without exactly being stimulating although the modest increase of 3d to 7s 6d in the President Brand total for the year to September is pleasantly surprising. It had not been thought that the taking over of the nearby Saaiplaas mine would be reflected in distribu- tions until the financial period 1966-67. There may also be a little disappointment with the ab- sence of the predicted modest advance in the Western Hold- iags payment which remains at 16s. Harmony has sustained its 2s dividend rate but has cut its tax-free capital payment to 2.4d and there now remains \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t only one final small instalment of this lengthy series of extra distributions arising from the deal with the adjoining Vire gluai mine way back in 1961. Harmony 5s shares are 20s 10%d. Their investment attractions still depend heavily on the reef development results in the unexploited part of the property especially west of the major eo Bron fault. So the quarterly reports-the next is due on October 17-should be carefully watched. Gold Fields Issue The South African upheaval came at an awkward moment for Consoldated Gold Fields' 0.5m. rights offer, the closing date of which is September 21. Shareholders should remember. however, that rather more than half the money is in any case needed for undertakings outside South Africa, while the bulk of the Â£2.5m. being put into that country is going into that promsmin embryo gold mine, Kloof. These shares are a par- ticular Johannesburg favourite and actually this week, despite everything, reached a best-yet 35s 10Yd. Altogether. Gold Fields' shareholders should have every reason to follow up their invest- ment in this strongly expanding group and to hope that Mr. Callaghan will not always be there to cut back their reward as he is likely to have done for the past year. when a Is divi- dend cut to 5s 6d is expected solely for tax reasons. RST Does Well In the world of copper Roan seleetion Trust came out with the expected brilliant results for the year to June, achieved despite a high level of royalty payments to the Zambian Gov- rnment based for a large part of the year on prices that the mines were nowhere near obtaining. The parent company's propor- tion of the net profit works out at 9 S5d a share, compared with 8s 2d in the previous year. The final dividend is due to be announced on October 7.. A higher total than the 6s 3d net of Zambian tax for 1964-65 is naturally expected. It is early days yet to make any confident predictions about the current year when the special export duty put on last April will be making its impact and the end may not yet have been seen of the spasmodic labour troubles on the Copper- belt. Not that the recent one should have caused much embarrassment because of the stocks built up during the inter- ruption of the Rhodesian export route earlier this year. It is worth noting, however, that the RST results for the past year were based on a metal price average of only Â£304 a ton. Even after its recent sharp setback the 3-month price of wirebars in London is still Â£385. Resilience From Australia there has come encouraging news from two of the copper producers there. Mount Morgan and Mount LyelL The former actually made a higher profit in the year to June than it did in the previous year despite the fact that a half-time announce- ment last February said that water shortage brought about by drought had meant a loss for the first 29 weeks of the year. Mount Lyell. now under the wing of Consolidated Gold Fields. is getting good results from the exploration of the orebodies lying below its pre- sent open pit in Tasmania and ,is thus building up its long- - P..#-r",

Presunmab & he did he would have t& act for the vendor, so couli not act for me. What do do? Also there are hardly aon advertisements by surveyor and valuers. How does on get a guide to prices ? In Scotland a solicitor cai and frequently does act for botd purchaser and seller althougi the practice has been dis approved. There are firms of estate agents in Scotland who adver tise houses and give an upse price. This practice is growing However, houses in Scotland an generally sold through solicitor] and it is not the practice foi them to indicate any price il their advertisements. If you an interested in such a house yor would normally inspect it ani if sufficiently interested, have ii valued. You would then instruci your solicitor to offer on youi behalf such sum as you mighi think appropriate. It is normal to put a time limit of one o0 two days for acceptance of youi offer. If it is accepted you have a. binding contract of sale which you can enforce without furthei formal document. DAILY PAY My wife is a part-time school mistress, paid an hourly rate on a daily basis, her accrued emoluments being remitted to her monthly. Her emoluments from March 7 to April S were remitted to her after April 5, and taxed as though they were the &is month's Income ,of the current financial year. Had the amounat involved been paid last year, then it would have come within the scope of her personal allowances .and attracted no tax. I maintain that the amount in question should be treated as last year's income but the local Inland Revenue author ties maintain that it is nor mal practice to consider the date of actual payment to be effective for taxation pur. poses. What is your opinion? Assuming that the contract o1 employment entitles your wife to be paid on a daily basis, in our opinion, your view is correct and it certainly should not be difficult for you to prove that your wife is paid on a daily basis. If the Revenue do No legal responsiblity can be accepted by The Financial Times for the answers given in these coluns. AllAU inquirIes will be answered by post. No charge Is made for this service not alter their view it may be necessary to take the matter to appeal. You will appreciate, however, that the Inspector will adopt the same basis in succeeding years if you wish to pursue the matter further this time. RIGHT TO HOUSE My wife bs deserted me. The family house, which is held on mortgage to a blilding society, is lnpor joint names. I bitend to se for divorce. Meanwhile, can you tell me what rights my wife has in relation to the house in which I am still living? As the house .is in the joint names, it is held upon trust for sale. In general we do not think the Court would order the trust for sale to be carried into effect pending the divorce, although it has undoubted power to do so. Unless after the making of the divorce you can persuade the Court to vary the convey- ance into the joint names, as being a \" settlement,\" the ultimate result must be that on the making of the divorce the house will have to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between yourself and your former wife. A COVENANT For years ago my father covepanted to make payments to my chldren, but his affairs have taken a turn for the worse, and he may not be able to continue. If he defaults, would the tax recovered have to be repaid? Are there other diicultles to be guarded against? The failure to pay the covenanted payments in the future, will not affect the pay- ments which have already been made. There is therefore no income-tax difficulty. The only point is that pre- sumably the covenants were made in favour of trustees for the children; strictly speaking, the trustees should take steps to",

   "text_content" : "I recently bought a house with a well stocked garden. On moving in I found that most of the -Aock had been re- move,; Also towel rails, electric light fittings and out- door aerials had gone, the olid fad bolier was choked with wet rubbish, and large quantities of quite incqm- bustible debris from a bonfire had been left. In the garden. Was the vendor entitled to do any of these things? How can I set about obtaining reparation ? To answer your last question first, it is obvious that you should commence by a \"solici- tor's letter,\" and if this does not produce an offer in settlement, you will have to commence pro- ceedings in Court. In the ulti- mate analysis, the only way of asserting one's legal rights is to go to law about them, however distasteful such recourse may be. The condition of the pro- perty is frozen from the time of the signature of the contract to purchase. That contract (unless, L*j.u-. %7iYI-lZR.Lj.E. a of course, it provides expressly to the contrary) includes as part of the very property sold every- thing which is firmly attached to the property - including plants, shrubs, etc. and towel rails as well as trees and door.. As an entirely separate obliga- tion, the vendor has to look after the property until com- pletion in a reasonable manner. The answer to your questions is that the vendor cannot \"get away\" with stripping the gar- den once contracts- have been exchanged. Accordingly, he is answerable in damages for having done so; nor was the vendor entitled to remove any of the things you mention (of course, he could take lamp shades and the electric light bulbs) and is once again answer- able in damages. We also think that you would have a claim for damages in relation to the costs of clearing the solid fuel boiler: we are less certain about the bonfire, but if the propor- tions were very large, we think it would be worth having a go at him over this as well. ensure that the covenanted pay- ments are met (unless directed by the Court not to) but they need not do this, provided they are willing to run the risk of the beneficiaries complaining later on. M.W.P.A. POLICY I wish to take out a policy under the Married Women's Pro. perty Act, but not muakli my wife the recipent, becaume I wish her to have the Income for life, and the capital to go to my chillren. Could the monies derived from the policy 3o to the trustees of my will? There is nothing in the Married Women's Property Act which prevents you from im- posing a statutory trust upon the proceeds of sale for your wife for life; with remainder to your children. Accordingly, there is no reason why you should not effect such a policy, with the result that the monies payable thereunder will not be aggregated with the rest of your estate on your death for the purpose of determining the rate of duty. You can make the trustees to receive the policy monies the same persons as the trustees of your wilL A TRANSFER I want to give my daughter some shares worth about I66 (1) Can I get a transfer form and send it to the company with a certificate? (2) Must the transfer be stamped, as no money passes? (1) Yes, but you'will have to lodge the completed transfer through an \" authorised deposi- tary.\" Your bank will fulfil this role for you. (2) Yes, you will have to send the completed transfer to the Controller of Stamps, Adjudication Section, Inland Revenue, Bush House (S.W. Wing), London, W.C.2, together with a plain copy of the transfer. The stamp duty on shares worth Â£66 will in fact be 15s.

Mr. Sangster had previously had talks with Bank of England officials. Mr. Sangster told THe FINANCIAL TIMBs that although Jamaica had been granted the right to raise money in London each year, nego- tiations so far had failed to agree on this year's loan. In the past. individual borrowings by Jamaica have usually been of the order Â£2m Â£3m., and it is understood that Jamaica is asking to raise a similar amount this year. He pointed out that of the Â£21m. Jamaica allowed for capital expendl. ture, Â£12m. has to be borrowed. Mr Sangster reaffirmed that Jamaica's deoision to sever the link between the Jamaican pound and sterling did not In any way mean thet Jamaica was going to follow a dif. ferent monetary policy.

And the Peloponese, with Its mitchless relics of antiquity, its massive mountain range and fertile plains, and its tendledly iadented coastline combines all the best of -Greece-the sun, the sea and the incomparable beauties to be seea. The only danger is trying to cram too much into two or three weeks* the wise will con- fine themsefves to the Eastern side to start with. From Athens, fast roads make short work of the first stage, to Navplion-nearly as quick as the London-Athens journey by BEA's new Trident services (4% hours, via Rome, Â£85 8s return). Navplion is the most convenient centre for the riches of the Argolid peninsula, and it is well served by an extremely reasonable network of bus ser- vices. Alternatively, with a car (costing 18s a day for a 4-seater, plus 64 a kilometer) one can choose the best times of day for sightseeing and thus avoid the hot mid-day rush that so many groups of tourists must endure. Plain of Argos To visit Mycenae in the early morning, when the sun slants upon the incomparable plain of Argos and highlights those streets and palaces which saw so much that was valiant and noble and so much that was cruel and treacherous, is an ex- perience indeed. Epidauros is at its best in the evening, and so too is Tirins when through the watchholes in its gargantuan walls the dying sun turns the Gulf of Navplion to molten gold. Only Asine, the <bird of the great Mycenean sites, is tolerable at mid-day, for after seeing its sparse remains and gazing like the legendary Lord of Asine out over the sea, one can climb down to the adjoining beach and cool one sef with a swim. All are easily reached from Navplion, and Navplion, with its great bay, its graceful old houses, its many restaurants and cafes, makes a pleasant base for exploration. It is well endowed with hotels in all price ranges (30s a night is a good average for a double room at a better- class hotel); and to my mind it Is important to choose one that does not insist on full pension, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t js thus denying one the pleasure of ,t lunching at the BeWe 1 l.61a at P Mycenae or at one of the town's it quayside restaurants, where a ly meal with wine rarely comes to r. more than 12s a head. sr Out at Tolos, the former fish. r, ing village now suddenly be- in comes a busy resort, there is ly the Hotel Solon on the beach. id and this is a pleasant alternative io if you can find room there. st Three good spots But after a week in Argolis one needs to escape from the ly itinerant crowds with their ts cameras and guide books that of throng the sites and beaches sc alike, and for this one must w strike south, over the moun- id tains and through the central as Peloponnesian plain, to a choice x- of three delightful and utterly un-touristy spots. he Yithion, the ancient port of as Sparta and chief town of the in Mani, the wild middle peninsula IS of the southern Peloponnese, is )n right away from the beaten s0 track, yet easiest to reach along in an excellent road. The pretty Dr little town sprawls along the as valley towards the sea front ry and curls along it. a, Of its three very simple hotels e0 the best is probably the Pan- ice theon. but at the Kranai I had no complaints about my white- m washed room that looked over th the quayside and the bobbing Id fishing boats and out towards id Cape Matapan; and it cost less or than a Â£1 a night. ed At one end of the quay is a e;s small beach from which one ge can swim over the sunken re- :r- mains of the Roman town; at it the other is the main square at with its cafes and tavernas. an, A more peaceful spot would be hard to imagine unless it were Monemvasia, the ancient Byzantine stronghold that dominates the Eastear prong of the Peloponnese. The unpretentious but comr sortable Monemvasia Hotel. costing 35S a night for two with breakfast stands on the main- land shore, on the edge of the new part of town with its little shops; and excellent restaurants; the old. town, enclosed within massive, walls, clings to the eastern slope of the grOat rock joined -to the mainland by a single slender causeway. Its tiny streets wind between whitewashed Venetian houses and ruined churches. under archways and curly-tiled roof- eaves, and make it one of the most uniquely picturesque towns in all Greece with the blue sea fanked by rugged promontories stretching away before it. Kythira The third alternative is Aphrodite's isle- of Kythira, whose double-curved harbour at Kapsali must be one of the most beautiful anywhere. Cheaply reached by'boat in a few hours from either Yithion or Monemvasia, Kythira was once under British rule with the Ionian islands, and its people are exceptionally friendly to us. At Chora, the main town, only one minute hotel so far exists, but rooms can be rented for a few shillings in private houses. Taken all in all, it would be hard to choose between Kythira. Monemvasia and Yithion for sheer peace and beauty; perhaps a few days in each is the answer.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Points to Watch in Buying Bulbs",
   "text_content" : "BY A. G. L HELLYER Editor of Amateur Gardening ONE GREAT advantage of bulbs is tat, provided they are of easonably good alty, one is virtually assured of a display the rlnt season. The flower embryo are already there, in the heart of each bulb, and warmth, light and water are the only things essential for their development into flowers. It really matters very little how poor the soil may be, how un- favourable thei situation: if the bulbs are good and sturdy they will reward their purchaser with at least one round of flowers. What happens another year is quite a different matter. Then it will be seen whether conditions have been sufficiently to the bulb's liking to enable it to repeat the performance. If it has been starved or checked or grown in an unsuitable environment, it will have exhausted, all its reserves and have acquired nothing new with which to replenish them. Daffodils Partly this is a matter under the gardener's control but not entirely so. Some bulbs are much easier to manage than others, some are much better suited to the average conditions ia gardens in the British Isles. Daffodils are among 'the easiest, hyacinths are much more difficult. Buy strong daffodil bulbs, plant them In reasonably good soil in an open, or at least not too heavily shaded, place, and see that no one interferes with their foliage until the middle of June, and the odds are you will not only have a good display the first spring but the second spring as well, and a good many years after that if the bulb clusters are lifted occa- sionally, separated out and re- planted as single bulbs. Unless you are fortunate enough to live in a really good bulb grow- ing Idcality, such as parts of Lincolnshire, Cheshire and north Devon, it is unlikely that hyacinths will perform anything like as well. They may go on flowering for years but with spikes of diminished size ecause the bulbs have never been able to regain the strength they had when they were pur- chased. In this respect tulips come mid- way between. They like a rich, open soil, with plenty of moisture from March to May but not too much afterwards. That famous bulb strip in Holland, south from Haarlem, suits them admirably be. cause the soil is light and the water level can be controlled by lifting or lowering the canal sluices. There are similar areas in England and it is possible to buy just as good English as Dutch grown tulips. But the'chances that equally good tulip bulbs can be produced in most gardens are small and as a rule tulips gradually deteriorate with the years. But, of course, there are other thins. to consider besids the number of years the bulb will lat. Daffodils ake a splendid display ian there rea g:S e varouy do, lightful varieties diri m, size and colour. but sW A the colour rane is limited by com, parison with that of thebo tulip. Moreover nl n years a new Impetus has be ven to tulip breeding by the ddion of Species such as Tulip kaufmniina T. greii and ?T fosteiana t tohe alread ery hybrid mixture with which the breeders work. T. kauf- manniata hat added a new shape, its petals being long and broad and curling outwards as they de- velop so that the flower bas some- what the form of a water lily. T. greiii has enabled breeders to produce a great many bi-colour tulips, some of them such gay flowers that one grower has coined the name \"Peacock Tulips\" for them. T. fosteriana has brought a new brilliance of' colouring and the largest flowers we have yet seen. Bulb prices While these new developments have been going on, the oldstyle tulips have also been developed. The Darwins with their long, study stems and big, rather square shouldered flower, are still the aristocrats of May. Along with them come the Cottage tulips with their greater diversity of flower shape and that particularly attrac- tive off-shoot of the Cottage race. the Lily-flowered tulips. These are my personal favourites and if I could only grow one variety of tulip it would probably be one of these pointed petal types, such as soft rose Mariette or red and yel- low Queen of Sheba. I am often asked to explain the great variation in bulb prices. These are controlled mainly by two factors, the size of the bulb and the length of time the variety has been in cultivation. Badly cultivated or Qvercrowded bulbs will be small. They may not even contain embryo flowers, and even ifthey do, they will 4ot pro- duce such fine blooms As those from big bulbs. For this reason alone the big bulb is almost always worth its price and the small bulb may not be worth buying how- ever cheap it is. Newness is quite another matter. It may take 10 or 15 years to work up stock of a new variety to a point at which it becomes popularly priced. In the inter- vening years it may cost a lot of money but it is only specialists who are likely to want it At this stage. For garden display there is no reason to pay more than about 12s a dozen for tulips and daffo- dils, and a great many fine varieties can be bought for half that :. , , - . ;",

   "text_content" : "BY DUDLEY NOBLE I A CLAIM which Volkeswasge* weok makes fr its cair I that they need no prolonged running- in bugean be driven quite hard. right f0tA(, MP . When, the other day, I set of from the assembly factory at Wolfsbursg only a few miles west of the border with East Germany, they told me not to worry about keeping speed down-yet the speedometer on the brand new 1500 \"-beetle\" showed all but a tow of five noughts. The needle was soon pointing to 70 m.p.h. (it was a car for the U.K. market) as I sped along the autobahn that runs from Helmstadt past Brunswick and Hanover to the Belgian frontier near Alx-la-Cha&eose. As the kilometres rolled by I lost my instinctive fear of a .seiz-up and pressed on as fast as this bigger VW would go, which was just on the 80 m.p.h. mark. Cruising speed is, as the makers said, the same as the maximum. Since this new 1500 looked outwardly exactly like the present 1300-e.xcept for the letters and figures on the tail panel-other beetle drivers whom I overtook sometimes seemed quite peeved at their own lack of speed. Many improvements Adding this larger-engined model to the range should win new friends for such a well- proven car. Under the surface, however, it has been consis- tently improved over the years: it will, indeed, soon be 20 years since the first beetle rolled.out of Wolfsburg. Many have I driven during that period, but this latest 1500 is the best yet. It does not suffer qaite so much from side winds, now that the suspension has been improved, but this is not to say that it is not at all affected by them. At speed, a sudden gust would deflect it momentarily and make one choose between slowing down and wrestling with the steering wheel. The former oversteer has also been ameliorated; the setting of the rear wheels wider apart and fitting softer springs with a compensating device has helped in this connection. There has been no increase in body capacity, and if there are four persons aboard those in the rear seats have only limited room, especially when the front seats are well back. Luggage space beneath the steeply sloping bonnet is also restricted.-but iosaugmented by a deep compartment us t behind the back seats. Passenger safety An Improvement where pas- enosr safety is concerned is found in the flattening of all projecting knobs and buttons and making them of soft plastic material, while a new door-lock. ing mechanism operated by a knob situated on the window sill has been fitted. Disc brakes have replaced drums on the front wheels, and I found them fully satisfactory on this long, fast run to Zee- brugge. The fuel consumption had been fractionally better than 30 mpg over the whole of the nearly 500-mile run (and with a new engine, too). I would think that the average British motorist would have no difficulty in bettering it, with a well-run-in engine. Sales of this 1500 beetle in the U.K. are due to start at about the end of the present month, when its price will be announced. Governing speed The inventor of a novel governor for automatically keeping a car's speed down to a prescribed limit gave me a practical demonstration of its capabilities during the week. With a 2.4 litre Jaguar he showed how a 30, 40, 50 or 70 m.p.h. restriction could be ad- hered to without having fre- quently to look down at the speedometer. A knob on the fascia panel, when set to the appropriate position, caused the speedo- meter needle to act electrically on the carburetter throttle and prevent the selected speed from .being exceeded. Yet, by pres- sing the accelerator pedal against the pressure of a spring, the control could be overridden under normal circumstances. It could, however, be arranged that a positive stop could be imposed so that a commercial vehicle, or, perhaps, a borrowad car, would be limited as to maximum speed. I was informed that interest was being displayed in the de- vice by both the authorities and certain motor manufacturers. The cost of converting an exist- ing car would be around Â£10.

   "text_content" : "Cinderella is a fairytale abotat . servant-Sirl who marries a prince- but in its more moving manifesta. tions it is also a human tale about a prince who conquers the blight of being born to rank and fqrtune and becomes a man. To quote The Magle Flute: \"But will 'th youth be able to survive these ordeals? Remember, he is of royal blood,\" and Sarastro replies: Still more-he is a man!\" Rossini's is the most human handling of the story. Ramiro's tutor has instilled in his young pupil the precept \"Follow the promptings of your heart,\" and with a little careful guidance he is led past the lures of title and riches to find true happiness. The Bolhboy version of Cinderella also flatres to its climax in Act 2, when the chaste beauty who has entered his court fires the prince, hitherto an arrogant and pampered lord- ling, to a new vision of what his life might be. Zakharov's choreo- graphy flowers in a pas de deux which is the apothesis of unselfish young love. Cinderella was originally planned to be a Leningrad ballet, with Ulanova as its heroine. Prokofiev worked first with Chabukiany, then Sergeyev. But the production was delayed until after the war, by which time Ulanova bad moved to Moscow, and here the ballet had its first performance, with choreography by Zakharov, in November, 1945. (Lepeshinskaya was in fact its first heroine; Ulanova followed a few days later.) Prokofiev did not have a great deal to do with the active preparation of this version, and he objected to Yury Payer's strengthening of his instrumenta- tion. A few months later Sergeyev staged his version in Leningrad (with himself and Dudinskaya), to the original score. And this is what we hear in Covent Garden, where Sergeyev's Cinderella, no doubt revised over the years, is the second work of the Kirov season. No one could claim that the Kirov ballets are good socialism; that is not their point. Their Stone Flower (unlike, by all accounts, the Moscow one) waters down a stirring' scenario with much irrelevant divertissement. Their Cinderella is not even good art- not by any canons which demand more of a ballet than some glorious dancing in non-specific but accomplished choreography. It would be wrong to damn a ballet, or a style, for not being what it isn't* but negatives we sometimes a useful approaci to to morte positive description. The Kiroy Cinderella is not. a -human drama. The. characterisation- is erfiunetoty. The two pas de deux,. beautiful though they are, might come from a Raymonda, or any romantic ballet; they are not parti- cular to Cinderella and the prince, let alone expressive of two stages of their relationship. There is no underlying \" theme,\" no realisation of any deeper significance beneath the fairy surface. On a shallower but still important level, there is not.even any attempt at dramatic unity and flow. Take the divertissement of tbe four seasons $a Act l- Prokofiev's aim was to revitalise all forms of the Maryuaky ballets, to preserve what was valuable in them while making them serve a less decadent purpose. And the \" sense \" of tife seasons' episode is plainy that all nature comes to pay tribute to the \"modesty!, indpstry and spiritual purity of hh heroine. In Sergeyev's version, instead of seeing a modest, tender Cinderella gazing with quiet-eyed wonder at these scenes, we have four \" mean- ingless\" variations, danced to the audience, and not even any Cinderella on the stage. Let me repeat- ot. to run down the Kirov at the expense of the Bolshboy butV to 'make clear a fundamental differance of ap proachb and intention-what I wrote after Zakharov's Cinderella three years ag,; that in the Act 2 pas dedeux, danced by Struchkova and Lavrotsky, \" one saw a spec- tacular episode in which one felt most keenly not the superb quality of the dancing, nor even its poetic power in purely liesthetic terms, but above all the emotions that were being felt and communicated. This-communication and projec- tion springing from the twin bases of superb technique and emotional involvement-s the special quality of the Bosbhoy.\" Superb technique was also to be seen last night from Kolpakova and Soloviev, and their dancing certainly had poetic power. But one felt no emotional involvement, not with this particular girl, this particular prince, in a specific situation. Similarly, Sergeyev retains the exotic episodes at the start of the third act-the prince's journey round the world in search of his beloved. What these can show is the youth's learning about life out- side the confines of his court- rescuing maidens in distress, and geerall proyving hjmelf worthy of CindreMlla (and this; of count must be achieved within the \" Maryinsky\" framewok, without ideolc heavinest;'Ã½ It needs light brilliant statement) What to fact the episodes dd is to present three trashy national variations, and three stunning ones, and two traverses, for Soloviev to delight us with the clarity, control and soaring poetry of his classical dancin Cinderella is that paradoxical thing, a ballet planned without any regtard for ap'prance, for Tatyana Bruni's revolting It would be more - yalb danced against plain curtais, for then we oould concentrate on the only thingw Usi bee csrefully considered the actiualdance move- ment*. .Sreyev ir a splendid inventor f abstract clssical dance in the Ivanov tradition' . 'H gives his performers difficult, beautiful things to do, and .they do them with the quiet grace and accomplishment that form the Kirov hallmark. The prince's stunning solos have been men. tiofed. 'Cinderella'si variations in Acts 1 and 2 are both exquisite compositldo, and in the-Act 1 flnalc. Kolpalkovoiad a sudden, heart-lifting eplIode. jCindere'*s isters .are also ballerinas. no less than Fedicheva and Makarova. HIere there Is a trace of characterisation. while they wear their superlative classical techniques with a differ- ence: Fedichevi shows a hard, ruthless streak,' and Makarova a delivious silliness; But I cannot conceal my opinion that this Cinderella represents a decadent form of ballet, somehov preserved into the 20th century as if Fokin and Lavrosky and all the other reformers had never been.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Autumn Festival",
   "text_content" : "The Italian autumn festival season -which features the Settimana senese in Siena, the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music, the Sagra Umbra in Perugia, and the Autunno musicale in Naples-begins regu- larly the last week-end of August in Arezzo, with the annual Concorso Polifonico Internazionale \" Guido d'Are25o.\" Italian music critics, sun-taaned after a music-less month of August, gatherr in this little Tuscan city to listen to a three-day choral competition, which attracts amateur. choirt from all over Europe and even from beyond the Atlantic. Each year's Concorso has its hero. Last year it was a splendid group from Hungary which scooped up a fistful of prizes and won long, loud ovations ,from the audience cramming the Teatro Petrarca, an audience consisting chiefly in mem- bers of rival choirs, all of whom show consistently a laudable, sport ing objectivity. This year's hero was the Schola Cantorum of Oxford, conducted by John Byrt: a small, intensely serious and well- trained group -*oft-young people, whose shy manner and sober dress was a sharp contrast to the long- haired British swingers who can be seen hitch-hiking along the super- highway between Rome and Florence. The Oxford choir won in two of the four categories (the two most important.and the only ones it competed in), one with a perfect score and the other with 98 out of a possible hundred. They were up against stiff competition, especi- ally from some older groups from Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and from the Yugoslavian chorus which was runner-up; but the Schola Cantorum's hair-fine preci- sion of attack, its dynamic range, and its sensitively perfect intona- tion made it outstanding even in its distinguished company. Another important late August' event in Arezzo was the opening of an art exhibition in 'the local Gallery of Contemporary Art. This was a small, but fascinating show of 19th-century caricatures, mostly the work of a group of Tuscan artists whose activities-artistic and otherwise--contred around the famous;, lonag-vInished CaffÂ® Michelangelo in Florence. The art of caricature began to flourish in Italy with the Risorgimento, and one of its leading practitioners- whose work is featured in this Arezzo exhibit-was Angiolo Tricca (1817-1884), a native of Borgo Sansepolcro, a few miles from Arekzo. A number of seri- ous painters, belonging to the Tus- can \" macchiaioli\" school, were also elegant and biting caricatur- ists; and their work was appreciated and encouraged by a whole group of writers and- editors, including Carlo Collodi, author of Pinocchio (there are two delightful caricatures of Collodi in the show). To music-lovers, especially to students of Giuseppe Verdi, the caricatures of Melchiorre Delfico are well-known; but most of those to be seen in Arezzo have not previously been published and, with Tricca's, they form the nucleus of the exhibit, which does more than just inform about the work of ,a talented body of artists. These caricatures describe, by in- direction, a whole vanished world. that ..intllectual,, international Florence. with figures like Prince Demidoff, husband of Matilde Bonaparte, the critic Martelli, and an assortment of foreign diplomats (Florence was, for a while, an important capital in the 19th century). A bit of that society is reflected also in the early chapters of James Pope-Hennessy's life of Queen Mary. From these carica- tires of Florence society driving in the Cascine or sitting in a box at the Teatro della Pergola, one imagines a delightful, idyllic life, spiced with gossip. The handsome catalogue of the exhibit, arranged and introduced by Gec (Professor Enrico Gianeri), himself a gifted and well-known caricaturist as well as an authority on the subject, is a model of its kind. as is the installation-with pages of old humouristic jourpals displayed ubder glass on old marble-topped cafe tables-by the architect Mario Mercantini. The enterprising director of Arezzo's Tourist Bureau. Dr. Alberto Droandi, was responsible for organising the show, which will Sremain open. through the month of September, after which time it I ii a r r 'I I t ii r",

   "text_content" : "by DAVID CAIRNS This was only the London Symphony Orchestra's second Prom of the season, the orehestra having been lan'Florda at Daytona Beach during most of August, winning golden opinions is a series of concerts under Colin Davis. Last night's playing, though enjoy- able, was something beow their best in point of refineent and precision. It may be a hazard of te hall, or a peculiarity of the of it in which I was sitting, ut was struck by the number Wof t fin Haydns Druim Roll th trumpets sounded a fI]actemnd th rest. WThru toutthe work never felt that IC0n Dvs' tempos were quite cbofortablk. The Music was always o thbe sun. A sure instinct for tempo is one of his great virtues as a conductor of Moaart, and it has been disappointing this summer to hear him inclined to hustle Haydn into what to my ears is a slightly unnatural briskness of lace (especially in view of his perfectly udged recorded perform- ance of Symphony No. 84) . The mood is too intently spirited. not expansive enough. The vitality and real pace and swiftness of the music, it seemed to me last night, required a more leisurely tempo to reveal them- a paradoxical truth which his own conducting often exemplifies. And, as a result, perhaps, there were untidinesses. The ensemble was nut so precise as the character of the performance demanded and implied. Untidinesses were no doubt present in Bart6k's Second Piano Concerto, a very tough work to do on a Prom rehearsal schedule, but after a rather stiff start the performance acquired splendid energy and tension and, in the Adagio, a glassy quietness above seething depths. Even a battalion of stentorian women coughers oseted at strategic points about the hall could not destroy the atmosphere created in this move- ment The solo part was played by Steplihen Bishop, who added to his already formidable artistic reputation by a performance that was equally remarkable for its rhythmic vigour and its cool, deep stillness. With his masterly play- ta of Mozart' major Piano Concerto. K. 503 only a few days ago, on Monday, this has been a great week for him. The second half was devoted to the Fantastic Symphony. This is *,very familiar piece for conductor ad, orchestra. performed by them at countless concerts in many parts of the world during the last few years. But there was no trace of staleness, never the slightest sugges- tion that they were taking it for granted. No-one else, in my ex- perience, is so aware at once of the fever and constant ebb and flow of feeling and of the essential reserve somewhere at the heart of the work's nature, as Davis and the orchestra. No-one else, not even Klemperer and the New Phil- harmonia, makes the Adagio so truly Beethovenian a masterpiece of man and nature. No-one else holds the tempo of the March so inexorably to the end, or demnands and obtains so huge a range of dynamics (from brutal fortissimo to the whimpering pianissimos that emphasise the nightmarish horror of the movement) or understands so well that the first Allegro is one of the least lush movements that even Berlioz ever wrote; for its neat is dry, scorched, electric.",

   "text_content" : "By SHEILA BLACK, Our Woman's Editor HAVING SOLD more than half of all the dishwashers helping out in British homes, Colston has learned a lot about these machines. Now it introduces the TurboJet model with a new washing system based on the turbine principle to increase the rate of water circular tion by about 50 per cent. Apart from improved washing efficiency -not that I'd noticed the need for that in case owners of former models are getting wotried-this enables the use of redesigned racks to hold more pieces. The perform- ance is quieter, too. Build it In, or stand it on the draining board and plumb it in to connecting hoses for automatic fill and empty. The price is 93 guineas but how well worth their price are dishwashers to those who can afford them. Colston Appliances' address is Wellington Road, High Wycombe, Bucks. For Stainless Teeth Stainless steel tooth mugs are elegant enough to use for all sorts of other reasons in rooms other than the bathroom-and are excel- lent for destructive child drinkers. Made by Valbania of Wyvil Road, London S.W.8, these fit into the standard Valba brand bathroom fittings. The top diameter is 3 inches, the base diameter 2 inches, and the height 3% inches. Time and Date For Christmas, back-to-school presents or any other reason, try giving boys the new Services Sports Calendar watch, designed to resist rough handling. At 70s 5d with the ordinary strap or at 76s with an expanding stainless steel bracelet. In the shops now and made by Services Watch Company of Leicester. Lighting Up Our picture does not do justice to the slim torch it depicts. This is The Imperial, one of the Gulton range that never needs new batteries. Plug it into'an ordinary electric point (AC) and, in a few hours, it charges itself with enough power to light up for two months. In strong plastic and varied colours, they are thin nqough for handbags crowded glove compartments and suchlike. They say it has a 450-foot beam, but I haven't paced that out. The price is 59s 6d (plus lid siur- charge at present). Distributed by Gulton Industries of 132-135 Sloane Street, London S.W.I. Now in electrical departments of large stores. Waste Away Many readers already know the Pollybin, though some may not. This garbage container is well designed so the lid can even be used to stand things on because it is level. The unit can be wall- mounted or cam stand in its own or trolley-the portability of the latter is useful for those who have the floor space. Quiet in use be- cause the bag laps over the holding frame to cushion sound. There are lightweight bags and heavier weights that can be used repeatedly and can even be rinsed out with soapy water and dis- infectant. There are also white opaque bags which do not look as functional as they but are nicer to have around the house. \"Short\" bags for indoors or \"long\" ones for outdoors. The main point of resurrecting a not-brand-new pro- duct is that Pollybin is now being made in stainless steel and looks really good with the white bags. The price of the gleaming newborn is 60s as against 42s 6d for the old type. Becoming available now, but delivery could still be up to two weeks in some cases. All details from Pollybin at 174, Holders Hill Road, London, N.W.7. Coffee Pair So many new appliances are now carrying Richard's label that it is not possible to list them all here.

   "text_content" : "THE TWO MAIN problems r' which are now being felt throughout British industry- shortage of cash and pressure Son profit margins-were high- lighted this week in the half- year report from Imperial Chemical Industries. The fore- cast of a Â£10m. drop in pre-tax profits for 1966 was accom- panied by the announcement of a Â£60m. issue of unsecured loan stock; this new money is needed to cover the gap be- tween cash flow and capital expenditure, even though the peak of ICI's spending pro- gramme is now past. Yet the reaction to all this in the stock market was probably overdone. What is involved for ICI is a slowing-down in the rate of growth, not an outright cut in production. Although the Gov- ernment's deflationary measures are having an important effect, there will be no drastic cutback in ICI's investment programme, and no rash of serious redun- dancies in its manufacturing plants. Exaggeration There is always a tendency to exaggerate the significance of particular gloomy announce- ments, such as the redundancies in ICI's nylon-spinning plants. when they come from one of the country's largest companies. The same thing happened last year when Ford introduced a four-day week in its car factories. This seemed to herald a major recession in the motor industry, but In fact the short- time working lasted for little more than a month. Car sales recovered sharply in the first part of this year. and even now the decline in sales for the rest of 1966 is expected to be little more than 5 per cent. Ford has even felt bold enouth to assure its employees that there will bW no short-time workinq for the niext 12 months, and is going ahead with its exiansinn plans. The companyv mav be over- optimictic. DPIand is certainly weakening. Pit there is no conclusive evidence as yet that the economy has taken a sudden and dramatic tirn for the worse. Sir Paul Chambers made it clear this week that the redun- dancies in nylon spinning would not be repeated in other parts of the company's business. *In nylon there had been a big build. up in the labour force during the spring, on the assumption that demand would continue to rise at something like the 10-15 per cent. rate which was achieved in the early part of the year, but this assumption was undermined by the July measures. How far the redun. dancies were due to ICI's own mlscalculations-nylon is now a highly competitive business, with a good deal of over-capacity- is not entirely clear. The Impor tant point is that they do noi prage massive unemploymen in other parts of the company What is more likely to happen is that ICI will let its labour force run down through the normal process of attrition; redundancy will occur, as Sir Paul said this week, only in a few small I pockets. As for investment, there will be some rephasing of projects, but ICI's spending in 1967 (which was in any case due to I decline quite apart from the Government's measures) will still be higher than in any pre- vious year except 1965 and 1966. There are some advantages in a stretch-out, since the plant contracting industry has been under intense pressure for the past year. Much of ICI's invest- ment programme has been de- f voted to the replacement of small plants using obsolete pro- cesses with very large, low-cost s units. A good deal of this will continue, even though it will be more difficult to sell the output from these new plants. Neverthe- less, there will certainly be some deferments and cancellations among the 300-odd sizeable pro- jects which are now being re- viewed by ICI. The danger for the economy D is that other companies, less able f to raise new money and less confident in the long-term future, will make much bigger . cuts than ICI, and that capital f investment as a whole will move * sharply downwards. The it National Institute pyedicted a drop of about 7 per cent. in r capital investment by manufac- d turing industry during 1967- much smaller than the drop in t- 1962 or 1963. This may be too optimistic. The shortage and s high cost of credit are inevitably it making companies revise up- N wards the margin of profitability it which a new project must yield le if it is to be sanctioned. At the * present time the shortage of C liquidity is a more powerful ' factor in restraining capital in- le vestment than the expectation of I lower demand, but the latter is . bound to grow in importance. iv No drastic cuts 'i The extent of the fall in it capital investment is still a ! matter for conjecture. As for C. the immediate economic situa- it tion, it is reasonable to take the n- statements made by Sir Paul Id Chambers about ICI's position 1s as a pointer to what is happen. In ing in the rest of industry. In d* ICI's case there is weakness in g a few areas, such as nylon, and n a general slowing-down in ie others. Capital investment plans le are being revieved, but the cut- as back will not be drastic, of especially where vital moderni in sation programmes are involved. ly The modernisation process will n. continue. It has already brought n big benefits in lower production a costs, and this is the basis for th Sir Paul's hope that profits In 1967, despite the anticipated ir reduction in demand, will be ot higher than in 1966.

   "article_dc_title" : "How Large a Government Role in Aircraft?",
   "text_content" : "BY MICHAEL DONNE, OUR AIR CORRESPONDENT IW r the trade days now completed, the aerospace industry is not only taking stock of a Farnborough air display that has been more successful than many had ex- pected, but also turning its attention to the problems that are looming for the future. During the course of the past week, actual or potential orders for more than Â£80m.-worth of aircraft and equipment have been announced, including a contract for six Concord super- sonic airliners from United Air Lines of the United States, and likely orders soon for another seven, from three more American carriers-Eastern (two), Braniff (three), and Northwest (two). Two promising new transport aircraft, the Handley Page HP-137 Jetstream and the Britten- Norman Islander, have been given Government launching aid and are both logging new orders fast Other aircraft such as the BACOne-Eleven and theHawker Siddeley748 have alsoannounced new contracts this week, and are showing considerable promise for the future. In short, the industry has made an impressive display of what it has to offer in its window to-day, and there is little doubt that the 11',000 foreign visitors have gone home aware that the industry is much more alive than many had expected. Most observers here agree, however, that the intro- duction of foreign aircraft from \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t France, Italy and Germany this year has been a success, and that the \" internationalisation\" of Farnborough must not only con- tinue but also expand in the future, especially as the U.K. itself extends its own collabora- tive role with Western Europe. The outlook for the im- mediate future is just as promising. By the next Farn- borough Show in 1968, most of the aircraft that have appeared this year will still be in produc- tion, and they will be joined by several new ones. The Concord itself is expected to be flying by that time and perhaps also the other major current Anglo- French projects, the Jaguar jet strike-trainer, while such new British types as the Hawker Siddeley HS-801 maritime Comet will also be on view. Whether there will be any additional Anglo-French or other' collaborative aircraft projects on show in the years ahead is one of the problems that the industry now has to settle in conjunction with the Government. The in- dustry's leaders here have welcomed the decision this week by the British, French and West German Governments to bring the airframe companies of the three countries more into the direct negotiations on the design details of the air-bus project. This idea.' for a short-haul high- density passenger transport for airline service in the period from 1972-74, has many attractions; and it could have a big market throughout the 1970s and '80s. But it has been hanging fire badly in Europe in recent months, as the three Govern- ments have tried to reconcile different ideas about its size and scope, such as how many pas- sengers it should carry and how many engines it should have. It now seems clear that by instruct- ing the airframe companies to get together. and prepare a single common design, the Govern- ments are hoping to speed the programme. Thus, the outlook for the air-bus is now more promising, although it is stressed that there is still a long way to go, and that time is running out in the face of mounting competi- tive interest in this idea from the Americans. For the other future Anglo- French venture, the variable- geometry fighter, the outlook is admitted to be bleaker. Further inter-Government talks on this project between Mr. Denis Healey, Secretary of State for Defence, and his French counter- part, M. Pierre Messmer, are to be held in October to try to settle the differences of opinion on the requirement for this aircraft, which currently have delayed a start on drawing up a detailed specification. Also, it is pointed out in the U.K. industry that the French are running into aero- space budgetary difficulties them. selves and may feel that the variable-geometry fighter is too expensive to be tackled imme- diately. It seems certain that the U.K. will not attempt the venture by itself, and so few in the industry believe that an early decision to go ahead.pn this pro. ject is likely. But the British industry is now firmly wedded to the idea of international col- laboration with the Continental aerospace industries. Long-term policy Next Thursday the aero- space industry's leaders meet the Government to start to try to hammer out a new long- term policy which it is hoped will help to fill factories that by the early 1970s will have run through the major part of to- day's big military contracts. The Government itself has repeatedly said that it intends to maintain a \" substantial \" aerospace indus. try in this country, and few can deny that so far it has been as good as its word, in that it has placed big contracts for the development of such aircraft as the maritime Comet, the P-1127 vertical take-off fighter, the Con- cord itself, and the Jaguar jet strike-trainer, and is endeavour- ing also to get the air-bus and the variable-geometry aircraft started. But what is worrying the industry is the longer-term need for advanced design pro- jects, which ought to be started soon if they are going to reach the production shop floors in the early 1970s. Such ideas Include an intensi- flcation of civil and military vertical-take-off and landing re- search, the development of a new military tactical transport aircraft, and a new inter-city feeder-liner. The Government's view is that the industry ought to get started on new civil pro- jects-such as the Hawker Siddeley HS-136 feeder-liner- for itself, and then apply for launching aid of up to 50 per cent. of the development cost. What the talks beginning on Thursday are likely to do more than anything else is clear the air, so that henceforward the two sides can work out the common long-term policy that is needed, with a greater awareness of the other's point of view. No decisions yet Whether part of these discus- sions will centre on the Govern- ment's own long-term plans for greater rationalisation in the in- dustry remains to be seen. While little is likely to be done until the Rolls-Royce/Bristol Siddeley Engines merger is completed towards the end of this year. there is no doubt in the minds of many aerospace industry leaders that the Government will be the most likely customer for the 20 per cent. stake in the British Aircraft Corporation that Rolls-Royce will gain through its acquisition of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Rolls- Royce has already said that it will dispose of the BAC share- holding and Bristol's other air- frame industry assets, retaining solely the ownership of Bristol Siddeley Engines. So far, however, as Mr. Fred Mulley, the outgoing Minister of Aviation, said on Wednesday evening, no decisions have yet been taken, but the industry itself is anxious to get the matter settled one way or another. The view among industry leaders at Farnborough is that procure- ment of the 20 per cent. stake in BAC, together with the Gov- ernment's increasing rather than diminishing stature as the princi- pal financier for the British Air- craft Corporation (the latest rise in Concord's estimated cost to Â£500m. is an example of this) may satisfy the Government's immediate desire for a bigger say in what goes on. Difficult Problem Hawker Siddeley's view re- mains unchanged. It believes firmly that it is up to the Gov. ernment to say precisely what it wants, so that the Board can put those proposals to the share- holders. Hawker Siddeley is also strongly against any outright merger with the British Aircraft Corporation, which it believes would be a disaster for the long. term future of the industry. How this problem of greater Govern. ment interest in the financial affairs of the industry is to be solved is probably the most dillicult of all the long-term questions now facing everyone connected with British aerospace affairs.",

   "article_dc_title" : "The First Ten Years of \"Saving with a Thrill\"",
   "text_content" : "BY LOMBARD THE PREMIUM Savings Bond will be celebrating its tenth birth- day in less than a couple of months from now-the first of the series was issued on November 1, 1956. It has not minnajl in thser first ten years of its life to attain the stature of other more illustrious members of the National Savings family. But it can be said- seeing that it is. after all. a bil of a freak-to have acquitted itsell surprisingly well. In particular. It has not turned out to be the five-minute wondei that many people forecast that il would be. Certainly. the usua initial surge of public enthusiasa for a new medium was followec by the usual falling off in demanc a month or two after its birth But subsequently the \"saving witll a thrill\" habit became well established in the U.K.-so wel established, indeed, that the inflom of money into the Premium Savingi Bond has for many years now beert far and away the most stabli feature of the National Saving; scene. Encashments, which were almos negligible in the year or two afte It made its debut have, it is true increased appreciably in recen years and are currently withih fairly close distance of the Â£flm a week mark. But the take-up o new bonds has grown at a corn parable rate. The result is the the public has regularly addei somewherq between Â£40m. ani Â£35m, to Its stake In the Premiun Savings Bond n every year sine the opening of the 1960s. And the means that it now possesses a tote holding of Â£560m.. representin between 6 and 7 per cent, of it total stock of National Saving securities, One thing that emerges clearl: from this is that changes in interest rate patterns have far less influence in this sector of the National Savings field than they have elsewhere. The failure of the rates paid on the Savings Cer- tificate and the Development bond to move up in line with other rates had a positively devastating effect on the flow of money to the Government under these two headings last year. But though the return the Government allows on the Premium Savings bond in the shape of its contribution to the prize fund has not been varied since the current series was launched in 1960-when, of course, interest rates were much lower than they are now-the public has insisted on buying more and more each 'ear. The Holdings On the other hand, it is evident that, if the devotees of \" saving with a thrill\" have shown little \" ratoe-consciousness.\" a substantial part of the population has refused to take any Interest at all in a form of saving wherein the nature of the return is wholly determined by the rotation of the wheels of chance. Thus It seems that the total number of investors-jf that is the right word-in Premium Savings bonds is still no higher than about 1Sm. Allowing for the fact that subscriptions by childres tend to be discouraged by the fact that they cannot be purchased by those who are less than 16 years old (though they can be bought for them by parents or guardian), this still means that well over a LIL T . |I, ,- half of the population has refused to have anything to do with the new medium. On the much discussed question of just how random \"Emie\" is the passing of the years has thrown little light. The procedure followed for distributing the prize fund. derived from the Govern- ment's practice of paying into it interest at an annual rate of 4% per cent. on the total value of bonds participating in each draw means effectively that each Â£1 bond has a chance which is a little better than 1,000 to I of coming away from the monthly draws with a prize ranging from Â£25 to Â£25,000. In the case of anyone holding the maximum of 800 units, this would mean that, if \" Ernie \" paid suitable regard to the Law of Averages-and I realise that some people maintain that this is a concept that he just doesn't want to know about-they should be able to count upon getting one prize roughly every 15 months. In practice, of course, the big prizes are very few and far between-those exceeding Â£50 represent only about a three- hundredth part of the total awarded. So it is more realistic to say that maximum holders should be able to count on geUing a prize of Â£25 or Â£50-most prob- ably one of Â£25-about once every 16th month. On the assumption that \" Ernie\" could, in fact, be relied upon to extend to his devotees regular consolation treatment involving t he award of a Â£25 prize at a '6-month interval, the effective return from an investment in Premium Savinas bonds would come out at about 2Y2 per cent. per annum. And since prize money is not subject to either income-tax or surtax, this would be equivalent to rather more than 4 per cent. for those subject to the standard rate of income-tax and correspondingly more to those in the surtax range, which is not perhaps too bad even under present-day conditions, seeing that there is always a remote chance that the holder will be granted one of \"Ernie's\" more substantial favours. Examination of the analysis of the distribution of prizes between districts issued by the National Savings Committee suggests that in the geographical sense \"Ernie\" does, in fact, show suitable regard to the need to spread the consola- tion butter fairly evenly notwith- standing his devotion to the ran- dom way of life, Disillusioned However, the pathetic letters I regularly receive from disillusioned holders of large lines of Premium Savings bonds which have proved as unproductive year by year as the sands of the Sahara Desert in- dicate that, if \" Ernie\" is pre- pared to have some regard for the Law of Averages at this level, he is apt to feel quite justified in dis- regarding it altogether when it comes to allocating even the small prizes within each district, Yet, I suppose it can be said that, if such unfortunates have not got any interest on their money, they have at least retained their capital. Well anyway they have been able to retain-and I am afraid Sir Miles Thomas won't like my mentioning this-that part of I It that has not been eroded by the fall In the purchasing power of money, lal ae sp th tr tei wi th th da G sa a tr de gc p1 dc th vt cc st in tli st th ni Sc tlb of",

   "text_content" : "From Our Labour Copnepondent BLACKPOOL, Sept 9. There will be a coflict this moath etee the trade uion and poltcal supporters of Mr. Frank Cousin. whether he should end his political career. The executive of the Transport and General Workers' Union, which is to meet in a fortnight's time, has already told him that he ought to give up his seat as MP for Nuneaton as soon as possible. It does not want him distracted in any way from his job as general secretary of the union. ou c I luneronD consuuency Labour Party is.anxious that Mr. Cousins should stay in the Com- mons, at least until the next General Election. It has written to the TGWU asking to be allowed to send a delegation to discuss Mr. Cousins's future with the union's executive. By-election Fears The executive's quarterly meeting will take place during the week be- ginning September 19, and it is al- most certain to agree to receive the Nuneaton delegation. But it is un- likely to be won over to the idea that Mr. Cousins should remain in Parliament. The Nuneaton constituency Labour Party is alarmed at the possibility of having to fight a by- election in the near future. This is not just because it has a high regard for Mr. Cousins as an MP. It is short of the money to fight an election campaign, and it also fears that the electors of Nuneaton may resent the Labour Government's appearing to make use of the con- stituency as a sort of transit station for Mr. Cousins's political career. There is a feeling among many Labour supporters that the party might suffer the same sort of re- verse at Nuneaton that it did at the Leyton by-election of January, 1965 if he gave up his seat. In the Leyton byelection, Mr. Patrick Gordon Walker lost a seat which bad been retained by Labour a few months previously with a majority of 7.926 over the Con- ocy Tr. ,n- Sext I to red dr. in's ing be- al- the on. lea in icy the by- I is ard is an ars lay it's an* isit cal iny rty re- the >65 Ir. :at >uri a _IÂ· _ servatives. He. has now regainei it. But this reverse showed Laboui how dangerous t can be to Siv4 any constituieticy the impressiot that it is being used to provide the Government with a Minister. At the General Election this year, Mr. Cousins bad a majority at Nuneaton of 11,403 over hi! Conservative opponent He polled 27,452 votes. Mr. Cousins has so far avoided offending either the TGWU execu- tive or'the Nuneaton constituenc) Labour Party on this issue. This was the first meeting of the General Council be has attended since leaving the trade union move, ment for Parliament two years ago. Resentment One reason why he is feeling his .way so cautiously on returning to the trade union movement is prob- ably that he is aware of a feeling of resentment against him by a large number of trade unionists. A number of his fellow-members on the TUC General Council are determined not to allow him to dominate the General Council as he did two years ago. Whether he will continue to play his self-effacing role in the coming months is another matter. Undeterred by the failure of his attempt at Congress this week to persuade the delegates to oppose the pay freeze and the Prices and Incomes Act, Mr. Cousins will be leading the attack on the pay freeze again at the Labour Party",

   "text_content" : "By Our Political Reporter CHANNEL TUNNEL TALKS IN LONDON Discuslons at Milnsterial level between the U.K. and French Governments on the methods of finanmeing, building and operating the Channel Tunnel, are expected to be finallsed In Paris next month. It is thought that development work on the methods of con- struction will thep be stepped up although a start on the actual building work is not ex- pected before 1969. Mrs. Barbara Castle, Minister of Trans- port,, met M. Edgar Psanil, French Minister for Equipment, in London yesterday for general discussions. The Ministers agreed to meet again in Paris on October 28 The Chancellor forecast last night that the incomes policy would be needed \" more than ever \" when the present standstill was over if stable prices and a rise in the real value of earnings were to be achieved. WAUKEg5m WCM Itu E: EUnCac. Mr. James Callaghan emphasised that although no one wanted Government interference in wage bargaining for a day longer than was necessary, there would clearly have to be much more agree- ment between both sides of industry before the CBI and the TUC could handle the problem between them. Until then the Government must govern in the interests of the nation as a whole, and it must govern fairly.\" The Chancellor. in his first maior speech since the end of July. surveyed tLh- present state of the economy and gave Britain's attitude to the problems of world liquidity. He was speaking to the Welsh Council of Labour at Cardiff. 1967 Surplus Hope On the basis of the latest statis- tics. Mr. Callaghan said he looked forward in 1967 not merely to a bare. balance- but to a payments surplus. The reasons for the im- provement since Labour gained ,power. he said. were the 7 per cent. Increase in exports last year and the cutback in imports. which had recently shown a renewed tendency to rise. ' But since the seamen's strike the pattern of trade has been distorted and we cannot yet form any real conclusions.\" he declared. \" I1 am hopeful that exports will continue to rise and the steps that have been taken to check internal demand will moderate the growth of imports.\" In a reference to the prices and incomes policy he said: \"The pre. sent standstill on Incomes will serve its most useful purpose if it can be used as a period in which we in. crease productivity. Then, when earnings do go ahead again, unions and management will render their best service to their members and the. public if they keep increases in line with productivity.\" Turning to international trade, the Chancellor claimed it was just as improper to run a trading sur. plus for an unduly long period as it was to run a deficit. unless you were prepared to lend the surplus to the rest of the world. \"Nevertheless, there are some .ountries in the world that seem intent on amassing and holding on to reserves irrespective of the con- sequences to the trade of the world. International politics is a dominant factor in these matters, for there are' those who dislike the very existence of reserve currencies and especially of the dollar being used as a reserve currency. Those who hold this view openly say they would like to see the destruction of the existing system. although they are not so clear as to what they would replace it by.\" The danger, according to Mr. Callaghan. was that if these same countries continued to pile up sur* pluses when Britain and the U.S. were also in surplus, there would be too little liquidity to finance growing worldtrade. \"Supplement\" Therefore the U.K. Government had declared that it was ready to support any rational plant to In. crease liquidity throughout the world that seemed likely to com- mand general support. The Government. he added, welcomed the creation and growth of additional forms of reserves capable of being universally held so as to supplement the two exist- ing reserve currencies. He empha- sised \"supplement\" as he did not believe it was realistic to plan to replace the dollar and the pound in the foreseeable future.",

   "text_content" : "Financial Thime Reporter WITH THE DOW JONES index down to its lowest level since January. 1964 and the FT-Actuaries index (300 shares) falling in one month from its Seaes high of 119 to 95, life has been bleak for the equity investor on both sides of the Atlantic. Wall Street, at least, has the consolation of. some bright spots in an otherwise cloudy picture. Several market sections, notably airlines and aviation. continued to gain in the face of the general decline Glamour stocks, such as Polaroid. Burroughs or Texas Instruments. still show quite arge rises on their prices of February 9. when Dow Jones bit an all-time high. In Britain. investors have had few such consolations. for although over 100 FT Industrial shares are above their December 31 level. comparatively few have man- aged to escape from the general slide which began at the begin- ning of July. No main category Those shares which do show a rise on the year as a whole fit into no obvious category. Indeed. most market sectors seem to have shown remarkably similar falls-a factor which suggests that institutions have been. holding off from their normal buying, or switching into fixed-interest stocks. The only exception to this general uniformity is that the engineer ing and retailing stocks have held up better so far, since both are normally affected much later than consumer industries by deflationary measures. Stores such as Tesco and Pricerite have benefited from good results produced during the year. while the occa- sional engineering group, such as Vickers. has shown a rise on market revaluation of its long- run prospects. But beyond this there is remarkably little uniformity. Stocks in food and drink have been less affected than the rest, on the realistic assumption that consumption here is the last thing that is likely to be hit in any economic downturn. Spirits are, of course, an excep- tion, but Teachers, which has been expanding at the expense of Distillers at home, is among the gainers since January. Hedging against devaluation has been another factor causing some stocks to stay up while those around have fallen. Thus Broken Hill, with extensive Australian mining interests, has risen by 8s 3d, and Borax has done well on bid rumours and its American chemical interests. And since they escaped .the Chancellor's latest swipe, several tobacco shares have also gained. Both Imperial and British American have pro duced good results, and BATS is also suitable as a devalua- tion hedge. BP is, of course riding high on its las flnd, but hedging may have helped here as well. Most of the other gainers owe their good (or bad) for- tune to being subject to take over speculation or of actual bids. A period of recession. with profits and share values falling, is always a suitable moment for take-overs, and this winter will undoubtedly see a good crop. Jaguar and Ruston and. Hornsby, the diesel engine manufacturers, are both higher for this reason. although EMCs bid for Jaguar is going through while English Eleotric's 'for Ruston seems to have been warded off. Amalgamated Dental. having re- jected a 75s bid. is reconstruct- ng its capital, and with the possibility of a further bid its gain of 8s 3d seems scarcely surprising. General prognostications on which shares one should expect to do best in a stationary economy are so hazardous that most share analysts hesitate to give them. Paper and bank- note printing appear to have survived wll-rboth De La Rue and Portals have gained. but, their interests are so diverse that' one cannot draw any realistic conclusions. Bowater had a good half-year and is another favourite dollar hedge; on the other hand. newspaper stocks. with the exception of the News of the World, have fallen. which will probably lead to repercus sions in some paper shares. Aircraft, as on Wall Street, have done well. but for different reasons. Bristol Aeroplatne Is being taken over by Rolls. Royce, largely for its half-share in Bristol Siddeley Engines. Handley Page announced good orders for its small Jetstream airliner at Farnborough. and Rolls itself looks much stronger in competition with the Ameri- cans now that it can draw on the capacity and engine designs of. BSE. One traditional, but largely ineffective, escape route during bearish episodes on the Stock Market is into property. This does not seem. yet. to have been of much benefit to property shares, though Metropolitan and Great Portland Estates have both managed marginal in- creases on their December 30 prices. But building, by con- trast, has probably been the worst-bit sector of all."

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF There are one or two b features to close a week has seen too many dull oe0 . Thus, there are higher profts reported by Brituih Laud and Cowan de Groot-the latter with a bigger dividend too--ald, at the halfway level, by Sptirax Sarco and George Oiver (Foot. wear). But bad weather has bit Southern Construcdtio and forced a cut in the interim divi- dend. Cowan de Groot The unbroken growth achieved by Cowaa de Groot, toy and fancy goods distributors, since the early 1950's has not stopped yet PWe- tax profits for 1965-66 are 22% per cent. up at Â£209,000, but allowing for first time contributions from new acquisitions the true rise is probably nearer 15 per cent. Still this is fair enough in a year when costs of almost every description also went up. But the really intriguing aspect of these results is the situation surrounding the divi- dend. The rate has been increased from 27 to 30 per cent, but be- cause the directors waived their rights to the bigger interim-20 per cent. against 9 per cent for tax reasons-the actual cost on a aross basis effectively goes down from Â£71,000 on total capital rank. ing to a little under Â£48,000, leaving the company well within the letter of the freeze, if not in the spirit. All Cowan has to do now, however, is to convince the Revenue that as a \"close com- pany\" it needs the sort of reten- tions that justify an effective pay- out ratio of only 40 per cent. against the required 60 per cent. standard. In the meantime the shares at 8s 6d yield a useful 7.1 per cent. and sell at 8 times earn- mga Ketton Cement Profits of Ketton Portland Cement are down from Â£651,000 to Â£618,000 but, in its own context, this is an encouraging result. The drop in profits was confined entirely to the first half, although the bad weather which caused it continued into the second. Neither was there any question of raising sales volume to shore profits up; Ketton's problem lately has been dwcapaity, and production Ate'lly \"de~clid a little (but not 19 mu a profits did) in 196566. A new Â£1.8m. kiln should come on team* next spring, bringing with it an extra 30 per cent. of capacity. Even in normal circum- stances, this could put something of a strain on proitability while plant is runinin in and orders build up. The trouble is, with Tunnel Portland talking about a 4 per cent. decline in deliveries and APC fearing overcapacity in the in- dustry. Ketton's sale force is going to have quite a job on its hands. But at least the 12% per cent. divi- deand has earnings of 22.7 per cent to fall back on, taking a straight 40 per cent. instead of the stated, sub-normal 1965-66 provision. At 56s yield is 4% per cent. and the P/E ratio just over 12 times, the. latter a useful backstop for Thos. W. Ward (the controlling share- holder) . which is selling on a multiple of 9.1. Spirax-Sarco \"'A still quicker improvement\" was foreshadowed by the chairman of Spirax-Srco e rdn in the last report. And sofar his expeta- tions have been realised with pre- tax profits for the six months to June 30, 17 per cent up on the corresponding period of 1965 at Â£387,000. Even more encouraging is the fact that, margins in this period have widened for the rise in sales is 12 per cent to Â£3.38m. The question is whether the group which caters mainly for the capital goods industries-it is a leading manufacturer of steam taps, thermostatic controls and other engineering apparatus-can main- tain this sort of advance in the face of the economic downturn. In the past few years Spirax- Sarco has made steady progress overseas and exports have been on the upgrade, thus there is a cushion if sales decline in the home market. But for the second-half it would perhaps be best, in view of current uncertainties, to look for no more than the same level of profits earned in the latter half of 1965. This would give a pre-tax total of Â£715,000 against. Â£659,000, and earnings of some 38 per cent. for the 22 per cent. dividend; the interim is maintained at 7Y. per cent. At 19s, yield on the shares is 6 per cent. f387.WOÂ· Even more encaunging ir the fact that, margins in this period.bave widened for tbs the in rale5 ir 12~ lier ant. to 0.38m.

Tuesday, for instance, should see interim statements from Sehweppe and Briti Rop, the former pro- ducing half-year figures for the first time. Schweppes' margins had Im- -proved in the first four months, lartely because of stringent econ- omies, and a good proess report is expected. But British Ropes could be a disappointment. While last year's pre-tax profits rose from Â£3.04m. to Â£3.76m., warnings were given on ris- ing costs; and there are no great hopes for a lift in the half-time figure. No change is anticipated in either dividend. General Refractorise just about held its own in 1965 but companies in the same line of business nave not been doing well this year.

As idicatik by '.ihb airman, Lord KlUdesley, Ilat June, Rolls-Royce foresees a \"very substantial rise in sales, particularly , of amao eAigaS and spares, over the next three year. palni total over Â£300m. which, with demand for spare parts for V- the increasing sumber of engines a in service wi call for a substantial * .xpansion of turnover in future C drsi.n Tqtal sales of Rolls-Royce -t year amounted to some Â£126m. a d are expected to be in excess t| of 1200m. in 1968, when sales of ti Bristol Siddeley are expected to be a About Â£100m. Based on the latest audited accounts combintaed profits before tax and minority interests, but after a net deduction of Â£1.6m. to take account of tbe effect of new money raised by o Rolls-Royce in March, 1966, a ful year's nterest on the Convertible Stock and Debenture Stock which are proposed to be issued, and intereston C th balance of the cash consideration C pyable to Hawkers, were Â£12.8m. Group accounts of Rolls-Royce for ' 1966, for various reasons including I dittering accounting periods, will not t eflect a full year's profits of the group as constituted after the merger I and the earliest fnancial period for which a realistic estimate of cornm bined profits can be made is for 1967. Profit Expansion The directors of Rolls-Royce expect that combintd profits for that year- the first full year of the new group- will show an increase over the Â£12.8m. and in 1968 the latest year for which a reliable forecast of sales can be made. they are confident that expan. sion in turnover will produce a fur- ther increase in earnings. Net profits after tax, of Bristol Aeroplane, for the current year (tak- ing into account income from Bristol Siddeley Engines on a basis compar- able with the previous year) are expected, mainly due to the change in the system of tax, to show an in- crease over 1965. Having taken the advice of J. Henry Schroder Wagg and Co. and taking into account the factors out- lined, the directors of Bristol Aero- plane consider the terms offered fair and reasonable and unanimously re commend acceptance of the offers which they intend to accept in respect of their own holdings-33,695 Prefer. ence and 387,975 Ordinary. As known Ordinary holders are offered 63 Rolls- Royce.Ordinary plus Â£8 of convertible stock for every 100 shares, and for every Â£4 of Bristol Preference Â£3 of convertible stock. Full acceptance will involve Â£2,977,800 of convertible stock on which a full year's interest will amount to Â£230,779. Assuming com- plete conversion at the earliest date, further Rolls-Royce Ordinary issued will amount to Â£1,310,232 increasing the issued equity capital (assuming full acceptance of the offers) to a total of Â£49,045,686, on which a gross dividend, of 1 per cent. would cost In arriving at the recomnendation the Bristol directors have taken into account the relative prospects and are of the opinion that on present estimates the proportions of earnings available in future to the companys Ordinary holders through ownership of just over one-third of the equity of the new group should be greater than the anings of the company on its own. Merger Benefits Outlining reasons for the merger, the documents point out that the aero- engine industry is a highly competitive business in which it is necessary to operate on an international scale and the amalgamation ' avoid duplication of effort. Moreov.r, the combined iroup will be able to offer a range o engines as wide aas any in the world. Advantages should also accrue from rationalisation of activi- t ties. t The directors of Rolts-Royce intend r to maintain the name an goodwill r of Bristol and Bristol Siddeley and r the interests of employees will be safeguarded. On prospects of commercial avi.. tion, It is stated that the airline â industry is continu to pow at a - rapid rate, end this high growth rate Sis expected to continue. There should also be an expanding market for airliners of the feeder line type and for executive transports, and a Con- Stnuing requirement for advanced . engines orhigh performance military ' combat and transport aircratt throughout the world. In these cir- a cumstances the total market for - turbine engines, both subsonic and 1 supersonic. is expected to expand. - For motor-cars, diesel engines and other activities the directors report - that the new Rolls-Royce and Bentley motor cars have been exceptionally well received both at home and abroad and offer prospects for satis- i factory turnover in the years ahead. The manufacture of petrol and 1- diesel engines for both military and r commercial use is expected to con- r- tinue and together with associated rs activities will continue to provide a rt useful addition to turnover. There - are also \" interesting \" future pros. . pects for the other activities of Ic Bristol or Nuclear contracts currently held by of Rolls-Royce and Associates in connec. tion with the nuclear submarine pro- ve gramme will maintain the level of )n activity in that field and the company ill is \"well placed\" to take advantage m. of future developments. te Both companies are extensively en- ed gaged in the supply of industrial and ng marine versions of their aero-engines, ng at home and abroad, for electrical a power generation, gas pumping, ship Ms propulsion and in hovercraft and ast benefits may be expected to accrue from co-operation in these fields. - M ___.9*"

   "text_content" : "It was announced yesterday that the Hamilton Brothers-BP joint well (number 44/11-1) located on the Dogger Bank has been plugged and abandoned. No commercial shows of oil or gas were encountered. The drilling rig Ocean Prince has been released to its owners, Odeco (U.K.). But in the High Court Mr. Justice Lewis and Mr. Justice a. 3oldin found Mr. Ian Smith's Government to be the only effective 3overnment of the country and \".therefore on the.basis of .neces- .T ity and in order to avoid chaos and a vacuum in law this Court hould give effect to such measures of effective Government, both rd egislative and administrative, as could lawfully have been taken ti )y a lawful Government under the 1961 Constitution for the ' reservation of peace and good government and the maintenance .1 oi law and order.\" The Court then ruled that both extensions to the state of emer- gency and the emergency powers themselves were necessary for the maintenance of law and order and accordingly dismissed applications from both the European lawyer, Mr. Leo Baron, and the African, Mr. Daniel Madzimbamuto seeking injunctions against their detention. Opening the Royal Agricultural Show in Salisbury this afternoon, Mr. Ian Smith hailed the Court ruling as a victory for his Govern- ment. He was cheered when he told a crowd of 3.000 that the Court had ruled his Government de facto and said it was the only effective Government in Rhodesia. Premier's Omission The Premier failed to mention that the Court had ruled his Government and the UDI Consti- tution both to be unlawful. Instead he told the crowd the judgment was \" very good news for us and an im- portant milestone.\" Mr. Smith apparently failed to realise that the public security Bill-to be introduced soon to Parliament and including powers for preventive detention-might not be recognised by the Courts. Mr. Justice Lewis, in giving his ruling, warned that it would be the Court's duty-if the occasion arose-to scrutinise with particular care any further extensions of the state of emergency to ensure that the drastic machinery was not abused. Mr. Justice Lewis went on to say that the Courts must ensure that emergency powers were \"resorted to only in cases of genuine emergency and in accordance with the 1961-Con- stitution.\" Observers point out that the Preventive Detention 0Bi: might probably therefore lead to a head-on collision between the Government and the Bench. Mr. Smith, who again appeared to be supremely .confident, repeated his accusations against Britain of aiding in \"the evil propaganda war aimed at stirring up Rhodesian Africans against whites.\" The crowd cheered and laughed when he accused African Commonwealth leaders, saying they were criticising Rhodesia on principles \"which they never seem to mind riding roughshod over themselves.\" These \"more primitive\" Common- wealth countries, he said, wanted the Rhodesian problem solved in the -ame way they settled their own--\" by the use of force and, if need be, by mur- dering thousands of innocent people.\" He again criticised older Common. wealth members for appeasing the Afro-Asians.' While no one is surpriiet a; Mr. Smith's interpretation of the High Court judgment there is considerable surprise at his remarks about the Commonwealth conference. Both on British television yesterday and again here to-day he. has appeared to be embarrassing Mr. Wilson by his repeated comments about the in. effectiveness of the Commonwealth and the primitiveness of some of its newer independent members. This, observers. believe, is only likely to *make the Afro-Aslans more extreme and is not the attitude of someone genuinely, seeking a compromise agreement.",

Mr. Sharp announced that pay increases for the Forces and higher pensions and allowances for veterans would push Government spending for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1967, up to $8,600m.- an increase of SS50m. over the Budget forecast. The guaranteed minimum income of $105 a month for pensioners will be proceeded with this autumn. Payments are expected to start next year and will cost an estimated S225m. a year. $375m. New Bill Adding up these expenditures, Mr. Sharp is faced with a new bill of $375m. With such additional expendi. tures, Mr. Sharp and other middle of-theroad members of the Cabinet insisted, over the protests of left winners. that the medicare proaramme ht in the Commons. must be postponed at least a year, saving the Federal Treasury S340O, in a full year. The Minister said in order to keep future tax increases to a minimum and still contain inflationary pressures the Government had decided to put the knife to several other major ex penditures. It would cut dowq the Defence Budget, end Federal support for cer- tain forestry programmes in the provinces, and exercise restraint in the rate of increase this year for research grants from the Federal Treasury. The scholarship pro gramme scheduled to be introduced this year would be deferred. The Government would continue to restrict capital expenditures, and dis continue the winter. house building incentive programme. No Price Control Mr. Sharp said he planned no Federal controls over prices and The Federally-appointed Economic Council had been studying the re- lationship between prices, costs, pro ductivity and incomes. Its report would be presented to the Govern ment next month and be referred to a Senate-Commons Parliamentary Coms mittee now inquiring into and report ing on consumer credit and trends in the cost of living.",

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN THE IRISH raid Newbury in force this afternoon, and there is a distinct possibility that they will capture the three most valuable events on the programme. For example, in the Peter Hastings Stakes (3.30) for three- year-olds and upwards, run over 13 miles, which carries Â£4,000 added money, two of the four runners come from Ireland; V. O'Brien's Pieces of Eight and S. McGrath's Ballyciptic, winner and runner-up respectively for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July. On that occasion, Pieces of Eight defeated Ballyciptic com- fortably by two lengths, with Super Sam,, who is also in to-day's field, fourth, three lengths behind the .runner-up. Judged on that running he has little chance of turning the tables on either of the Irishmen. Nor, in spite of his impressive victory in the Northern Goldsmiths' Handicap at New- castle the other day, is it easy to visualise the other English con- tender, Double-U-Jay, being quite good enough in this company. Irish opinion is sharply divided between Ballyciptic and Pieces of Eight, the last-named of whom is reckoned to have improved con- siderably since Sandown. This he will have to have done in order to beat McGrath's four-year-old, for he meets him on a stone worse terms here. In fact, bearing in mind that in his previous race, the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, Ballyciplic passed the post first (he was subsequently dis- qualified) in front of Tesco Boy whom he was meeting on weight- for-age terms, he is beyond doubt the best handicapped horse in to-day's field. There are three Irish runners in the J. and B. Whisky Trophy (3.01 for amateur riders and here again there are conflicting opinions as to which is the best However, a shrewd judge tells me that it would be a mistake to oppose Chambrun, a four year-old gelding by Chamler, trained by O'Brien who, I see, won three times over 1% miles last season. He will be ridden by Mr. W. McLernon. Lomond would be a popular winner of the Newbury Autumn Cup (4.0) and is sure to run well. But here again, there may be another Irish success, for the grey gelding Abletai, trained by W. J. Byrne at Castleknock, County Dublin, landed a substantial gamble in this race last year, and, though he never showed with a chance in the Vaux Gold Tankard at Redcar, had previously won the William Hill Gold Cup at Kemp- ton with ridiculous ease. And before that be had failed by only a short head to concede Damredub 6 lbs over 1% miles at York. St. Padarn, a promising half- brother by St. Paddy, to Royal Hunt Cup winner, Casablanca, may win the Crookham Two-Year-Old Stakes (2.30); and Piggott. who rides him, can complete a double on Winkle in the Highclare Nur- sery Handicap (4.30). At Wolverhampton, St. Alphage could create a surprise in the Jack Woolf Cup (3.0); and though, judged on running in the Melrose Handicap at the York Ebor meet- ing, Calceolate has little prospect of beating Major Oak in the William Butler Trophy (3.30). her performance when defeating Placo at virtually level weights over 1% miles at Newmarket in July suggests that she may have had an off-day on that occasion, and I think that she may turn the tables this afternoon over a longer distance.",

The headquarters are in Scun- thorpe, Lincolnshire. It owns two terminals at South Alloa and Preston and has a terminal work- ing agreement at Gunness near Scunthorpe. These are included in the Tenneco deal. The operations are to be carried out by a new company, Globe Petroleum Sales.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Scientific Correspondent The first large fast breeder re actor power station, which is likely to come into operation in about ten years or so, is expected to have a capital cost very close to that of conventional generating plant, a paper presented at the Nuclex '66 exhibition in Basle indicates. Given by Mr. A. G. Frame of the U.K Atomic Energy Authority's Reactor Group, the paper puts the cost per kilowatt of a 2,000 MW plant of this type incorporating two reactors at only Â£47, plus interest during con- struction of nearly Â£5. The generating cost is forecast at 0.3d per unit of electricity, even allow. ing for a probable increase in the value of the plutonium used as the fuel charge from about Â£2-Â£3 per gramme in the early 1970s to around Â£8 per gramme as demand for fast reactor use builds up. INDONESIA'S ATTITUDE TO U.K. FIRMS By Our Foreign Staff U.K. companies whose assets were taken over by the Indonesian Government in 1964 will be invited to return in a minor capacity to Indonesia to resume business, said Mr. Frans Seda, the Indonesian Finance Minister, in London last nisht. He was speaking at the end ot the two-day talks between the Indonesian mission and Foreign Office officials, headed by Lord Walston, Parliamentary Under- secretary at the Foreign Office. The question of Compensa. tion,\" in the Indonesian view, does not arise-the Djakarta Govern. ment has merely been \" managing \" the manufacturing plants, banks and plantations. However, the Minister said the British companies' participation would be limited in scope. As a general rule the major share in any business would be held by the Indonesian Government.
