The i~mi diate problem facing Ministers is the situa- tion creatid by to-day's court case brought by the Associa- tion of StrlVupisory Staffs Executives and Technicians (ASSET) against Thorn Electrical Industries for breach of contract. If the verdict goes against the company, as the Government's advisers expect, a flood of similar actions can be expected from ASSET and other unions'and the wages dam would be broken. In order to prevent this. Clause 30 of Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act. may be activated to provide a statutory protection against breach of employment contract. This would effectively protect employers from having to give wage increases based on ASSET v Thorn verdict. At the same time there would be no necessity for the Government to activate by Statutory Instrument Clause 29, which gives powers of compulsion over companies to re- store wages to the level operating on July 20. The voluntary principle of the Prices and Incomes policy would thus be maintained. An affirmative resolution The Govetient would be able to activate thi ndemnitv clause im- mediately. Subsequently all that would be required is an affirmative resolution from Parliament within 28 days.

We.derburn, Profesbor of Commercial Law at London. He points out that protection under the Act would not cover an employer who attempted to go back to a rate lower than that paid immediately before the date of the activating order. This means that the Government pay rises gained since July 20 ncluding those which may be won by ASSET-and it emphasises the urgency with which many Minister. consider Section 30 should be :ctivated. The Government's point is that Ithough 'the Order bringing in Part IV will be laid. the only ection to be activated will be Clause 30. However, any activation of Par V will be regarded by the unions nd many Labour MPs as a highly unwelcome step towards complete ompulsion over wages. Althouah Dnly Clause 30 will be activated. t will be difficult for the Govern- oent to persuade the unions to iisregard the fact that the neces- ary powers to activate other more cntroversial aspects of Clause IV will be there for the Government's tking.

MICHABL STEWART, Minister for Economic Affairs, has told members of the TUC Eco- nomic Committee that there will be only two grounds for wage in. oreases during the first six months of next year-increases in pro. ductivity and the raising of the wages of low.paid workers. However, when he met the TUC leaders for one and awhalf hours yeterday they challenged him to be more spcific about what he meant by \"low-paid\" workers, Wage Levels\" They asked whether a man's pay should be judged on hourly wage rates or earnins, and they said It would be diffcult to persuade workers that their wages should be frozen when they were earning only a little more than men class fledas \"low-paid.\" Mr. Stewar did not answer these points but promised to consider them and to give a reply later.

   "text_content" : "I aLAII~1 D UI IULIRU By LEX uJ Stock markets were showing more signs of life yesterday, al- though bargains marked re- mained at a low level. The share index put on 2.2 at 308.2 and there appeared to be a little more business and inquiry-possibly in anticipation of the release of the ICI surplus application money. Gilt-edged were active and strong, with a good business passing and gains ranging up to f. Gallaher Gallaher's interim statement is a striking testament to Imperial Tobacco's dominance in the U.K. cigarette market at the moment through Embassy and Players No. 6. Excluding duty sales are slightly down and profits before tax have fallen from Â£9.7m. to Â£7Am., \"due to a substantial fall . . . ic our share of the market as a whole.\" Nor has the introduction of coupons to Cadets and Nelson been a success so profits are going to be slightly worse in the second half indicating a pre-tax total of around Â£14/m. The upshot of this bad news is a two point cut in the interim and a forecast that the total for the year will be 14 against 19 per cent., which is quite a cut since earnings should still be around the 22% per cent. mark. Does Gallaher en- visage things are going from bad to worse? Whatever the reasons this forecast means the shares yield prospectively 6.3 per cent. at 22s 6d against a current 64 per cent. from Imps, with the near cer- tainty of a dividend increase as soon as the Freeze melts. The Gallaher price, therefore, has fur- ther to fall despite a 30 per cent. drop to date from its 1966 \"high.\" Imps must be regretting it did not hive off this particular investment to its shareholders while the going was good. See also Page 14 English Sewing Cotton ts not finding 1966 any 9aore to its taste than iyll Sas for the first half are Â£37m. agatiattÂ£5.1nm. but after a 4180,000 rise in deprecia- tion profits before tax and nterest are down from Â£2.9m. to Â£2.3m. At the pre-tax level the shortfall is only Â£385,000. thanks to, Cl's and Courtaulds' decision to convert last autumn, and of course h\"d ESC's stock write down >4i, spread evenly throughout 1965'1 would have been even smaller. The culprt was the U.K. MOW side, since American Thread is-till pressing ahead with profits of Â£1.176m. against Â£1.04m., and non- textile operations are slightly up. Pressure on synthetic prices and rising costs, however, have almost halved profits in the rest of the group from Â£1.62m. to Â£875.000. Moreover, demand is beginning to look spotty, so despite the poor results in th second half of 1965 ESC will do well to keep level pegging from now on. Thus profts before tax could be around E3.85m. against Â£4.23m. producing .arnings after last year's super- oormal tax charge of 14.5 against the 15 per cent But the dividend Is going to be held which gives the share price something to lean on dince yield at 9s 9d is 7.9 per cent The sad fact remains that ESC's decision to break out of its tradi- tional and unexciting thread busi- ness has not yet paid off. Profits are unlikely to have the oppor- tunity of looking persuasive for mother couple of years. See also Page 15 Inchcape Inchcape is one of those com- panies combining trading and investment income; the result, as usual, is that the trading side looks cheap. Group earnings are 20.6 per cent, making the p/e ratio 7.6 times at 31s 6d. With over halt net assets and over 70 per cent. of profits after tax coming from East Africa, the Middle East and India and Pakistan, it is easy enough to see why the p/e is that low and why the share price compares with net assets of 57s 6d a share. Stripping the investments, worth Â£4.56m. at book and market values, produces a significantly different picture. Adjusting for the drop in share prices ince the date of the balance-sheet (March 31 last) brings the investments down to, say, 20s a share, leaving the trading side priced at 1 s 6d and producing carnings of 11.6 per cent. without consolidating the Indian profits. This means the trading side is selling at 5 times earnings allowing for a discount of a fifth on the investment. Cheap though this looks at first glance, there are two considerations that offer.a reverse view. The obvious one is the geo- graphical spread and the difficulty the group would have in reversing it in favour of the U.K. without realising the investment portfolio. Secondly, even the liquidation of the investment portfolio .wuld not finally show the trading side as clearly cheap unless the proceeds were handed over to-qhareholders Cunard is are*ent example dthis. It s ema al ong time since the rumourI of a bid from P. and O. drove the share price up to 57s id. See also Page IS B 'Bassett-Barratt Geo. Bassett's bid for Barratt and Co. is SOs nominal of 8 per cent. convertible uneoued loan stok 198l6.i and 2+ Bassett for ach Barratt. This values Barratt rt 97c 3d a share, taking the loan itock *t par, against last night's rlosioglt ce of 75s. Since the Bt d famillob holding over hul i e equity, bave already decided to accept, the, remaining rhareholdrs are left to contem- plate a fait accompil. Not that this should worry them. They are being bowdout at 15.3 times earn- Ing and f combinatlon of 'ie two comlanlI is a tidy solution to an obvious problem. Bassett has profits growth and an over. Iraft; Barratt no growth but El.07m. In cash .and near cash. See also Page 14",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-29",
   "text_content" : "By Our Commuoditiae Staff ASER TUESDAY'S sharp rise; cocoa prices eased yesterday in London-with the December con- tract closing at 182s a cwt, a fall of 2s 6d. It appears that, on reflection, the market felt that the official statements and unofficial rumours emanating from Ghana did not entirely justify the excite- ment they had caused earlier in the week. The snowball started rolling in New York late on Monday after the London market had already closed, with an official announce. ment from the Ghanaian Cocoa Marketing Company that it had so far sold 275.000 tons of the forth* coming 1966-67 crop, the sales for which are due to begin on 8/1C October. The market had ex- pected rather less. around 225.000- 235.000 tons. This unexpectedly large increase (not far short of 100,000 tons) was 53.4 per cent. up on the equivalent figure of a year :reviously. Dealers and speculators evidently did some rapid mental aritfmetic, subtracting the outstanding 100.000 tons or so on contrac: from Ghana to the USSR, the 40-50.000 tons needed for domestic Ghanaian pro duction and the 275.000 tons just reported sold from their own esti- mates of what this year's Ghanaian crop is likely to be. and evidently came to the conclusion that not. a great deal remained to be sold. On~ the strength of this New York rirmed considerably and so did London when trading opened on Tuesday morning. Market opinion sltmated part ol the rise could b traced to this reason, the rest wa- due to an unconfirmed report that Ghana was going to request defer- ment of its October/November deliveries by one month. By yesterday morning the excie. ment had subsided, and the influen. rial rumour from Ghana remains unconfirmed. Another factor which turned the market was the realisa. tion that Russia's 100.000 tons might not all come out of the forthcoming crop. At the same time there is tith further prospect of reduced U.K. and U.S. grinding statistics for the third quarter. The lonper-term outlook in cocoa is still distinctly hazy-\" It's a minute to minute affair at the moment,\" as one spokesman put it. A major cause of the continued air of uncertainty is the problem of how large the Ghanaian crop will be. There have already 'beeb reports of heavy rains with severe consequences in some crop areas. and of lack of success for insecticides. Coming on top of this the increased sales figures. and the fact that the crop will cer- tainly not be an early one. have all combined to blur. rather than clarity the crop prospect. Little has been decided yet-other than that the crop will not be a bumper one. The next few weeks will doubtless be watched with great interest.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Fur Correspondent iy Our Fur AT THE AUTUMN series of general fur auctions in London last week, which were well attended, prices as expected showed declines of up to 10 per cent. com- pared with the previous sale. Among the exceptions was musquash. which showed an average decline of about 7% per cent. Even mink suffered like the rest, but the Russian variety fared rather better and Kolinsky registered an advance of 5 per cent for the best offerings. Blue Fox, which had been so prominent for the last year or so and had made a succession of advances, found few buyers and was mainly withdrawn; the usual American contingent was con. spicuous by its absence compared with previous sales. SThe Hudson's Bhy Company's col- lection of 525.604 South-West African Persian lambskins averaged 62s 7d, showing a 10 per cent. decline, but many fine coat types were quite firm. A special and most attractive first collection of 3.504 natural light brown Afghan Karakul averaged 153s 6d witha top price of 230s. Eastwood and Holt. offered and sold 586,433 raw S.W.A.

The overall realisation was S5 6d, aod the highest price so black was 092s (b'roactail). It is reported that substantial private sales of withdrawn goods have liameme nml meai mlnu lloll been made since the sales. which is an encouraging sign. There will b- no auctions in October. The nexi will be of Persian lamb on Novembei 22 followed by ranch foxes on December 14. New season's mink wil ie offered on December 15. 16 and 19. and this will conclude the auctions tor the year.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Editor AS MUCH AS 200.000 tons of barley may have been lost as a result of the severe gale which hit most of Scotland on September 6. Nevertheless, the total home-grown cereals harvest is still likely to be in the region of 14m. tons--an all- time record. The total U.K. barley crop esti- mate of about 9m. tons was made before the storm occurred, but should still be at a record level. The wheat crop, estimated at around 3.6m. tons, is approxima- tely 500.000 tons lower than last year and of much better quality For these reasons the quantity ot wheat ayailable for, animal feed will be sinificantly smaller This. in turn, will help to ease the pres, sure on the feed barley market. Moreover, the latest estimates of crops in EEC countries show that their wheat harvests arb approxi- mately 3m. tons lower than in1965. but barley crops should be up by about Im. tons. The Home Grown Cereals Authority says that the record crop of horimegrown barley 'underlines the importance of the export mar- ket. It hopes, with those engaged in the export trade, that this year's barley exports will considerably exceed last year's figure of nearly 700,000 tons. The authority points out in its latest bulletin that this export trade emphasises that home-grown cereal marketing lies within the complex of the international cereal market. In 1965-66 the British market required 22m. tons of grain of which about 8m. tons were imported It cannot be over-stressed. says the authority that if supplies of British I I I I I grain do not come on to the market regularly all through the year at the times and in the quantities required by British buyers and users. \"then some of the market for British grain will be lost to foreign competitors. and once a part of that market has been lost. it is unlikely that it will be recovered.\" It is emphasised that the prices of competing foreign grains are currently running at a higher level than last year. and there are sound prospects of a good market for British grain so long as supplies come regularly on the market to meet the needs of the users. Forward feed barley prices on con. tracts registered with the authority during the week ended September 23 are quoted at Â£20 Its for the month of February and Â£20 17s for March. The authority hopes that these guide prices will help to ensure and stimu- late a regular sow of British grain according to the needs of the market and at prices which are both fair to buyers and sellers.",

The vacuvator is an apparatus consisting of a compressor and itbing-not unlike a huge house- -id vacup ckleanr. Previously t.ihad been glsed pccessfully away s.tnp tt(i dolk only for the .rOnsfer of liqiqu cargoes, an operation which requires com- paratively little time. Oil. Tanker But now the Indfan 'iotor ship Samudragupta Jayanti has sailed from the.River Plate estuary loaded with 28.200 tons of Argentine corn 10.500 tons of it taken on board work for a total ot seven days. The tw,P d ay separate oo or days. but both 4Pani~anod their local representa. Ili. ,.C P1BSA. \"consider this rnt experiment to have been a success. Pagnan and CAPESA calculate that under .optimum conditions. the Sicilmotor can move 300 tons of heavy grain to or from another vessel every hour. Twenty-seven .miles out from .the port here and without any previous trial whatso- ever, she averaged nearly 40 tons the hour during, a fortnight of unusually stormy weather. After separating from the Samud. ragupta Jayanti. the Sicilmotor returned to the Port of Rosario for partial reloading again, then came back downriver to complete in the Port of Buenos Aires (which has a clearance of 31.5 feet). She sailed from here for Genoa last month with 25,100 tons of corn, having taken it all aboard through her S s ___ eq I c Â·- ~ 27 miles outside of the port of Buenos Aire%. The transipment was done from the Sicilmotor i rather remarkable ship which a.s launched as an oil tanker in Genoa nine years ago. Italnave's Sicilmotor corn Ilcted the Samudragupta Jayanti's cargo at the spot in the River Plate where the loading of oil and iquefied natural' gas is normally done. The widening and deepening here of the muddy waters of the :ilted-up River Plate estuary allow hese operations to take place. The Sicilmotor has just been equipped, in .the Port of Genoa, with six Italian - manufactured grain vacuvators-three portside, hree starboard. A scale attached o each vacuvator weighs the grain as it comes aboard or leaves the ship. Like most vacuum cleaners being manufactured these days. the Sicilmotor's vacuvators are re- .ersible: they can suck in or blow out. The Samudragupta Jayanti and he Sicilmotor have both been chartered by Romano Pagnan e Fill ,f Padova. The Pagnan firm are big buyers of American and argentine corn and soyabeans. When the two vessels rendez- voused and coupled recently: he Sicilmotor's vacuvators took a total of 12 days to complete the operation. Rough weather, the main argument against the trans- missicn of grain anvwheygre,.ep.. t tlWe drcicsde. had interrupted vacuvators from nearly every con- ceivable receptacle: silos, barges lorries. Many Combinations Pagnan e Fili foresee the Sicil- oitor loading up with corn or :oyabeans, or both, in Argentine ports--or in the Port of New 3rieans-and then, back near her bome coast, blowing its cargo out into a fleet of smaller vessels which would distribute it to various talian ports. Apparently endless combinations along this line could be worked out. But the Pagnan firm equipped the Sicilmotor with the pioneer- ing grain vacuvators to avoid the 20- to 25-day waits, at anchor and ;t dockside, which ships it charters are forced to undergo at Buenos Aires. Recently one grain ship was caught, by a spate of holidays, at dockside in the port here and was tied up for 12 days at a cost n port charges of $6,300. The congestion in the Argentine ports mounts by the week because of the inadequate loading installa- ions and the never-ending demands of labour which push :osts up while slowing down the oading process. In the Port of Buenos Aires recently, on an aver- age day. there were 800 lorries oaded with corn lined up imobilised. Each lorry and its oad were worth an average of S231,00. capital which is tied up sometimes for weeks.",

Industrials led the decline and tired liquidation helped to provide larger than mainbody moves for some of the more volatile issues. After a day's low of 777.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.14 down at 780.95, .against a day's high of 795.60. The Railroad Index lost 2.16 to 196.03 .and the Utilities Index shed 0.88 to 125.33. Volume, however, decreased 310,000 shares to 5.99m. SSelling reflected disappointment that the rallying effort had viru ally petered out yesterday, realisa- tion that disappointing Motorola second half 1966 earnings expecta tions might be a sign of major problems in maintaining profit margins in more than one corn pany, some labour concern, Vietnam uncertainty, and Mr. - Henry Fowler's-Treasury Secre tary-warning that the U.S. might have to take \"quite drastic\" but unspecified stes to curb the dollar outflow unless countries 'with balance of payments surpluses stopped trying to accumulate more gold. Motorola fell a further S8 to a new 1966 closing \"low\" of S il. Other Televisions were also lower, with Admiral off S2% to S39y. The group rallied only briefly after a meeting of company and Govern Sment officials produced neither assurances that recent price in NEW YOAK.;Sept. 28. creases would be rescinded nor that manufacturers would refrain from future increases. Du Pont dropped S8 to a aew closing 1966 \"low\" of $152, in, Further reflection of belief that 1966 earnings would not reach previous estimates. Losses of S8 or more developed in Fairchild Camera at $134% and International Business Machines at 5319. Down $4 or so more were Xerox at $177% and Corning Glass at $292. Airlines were led lower by K.L.M., with $10 fall to $141. On the Pacific Coast S.E., Douglas Aircraft sold at $42, off 1% from the N.Y. close.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent THE QUEBEC Federation of Young Liberals preparing for the forthcoming National Congress of the Liberal Federation, which is to be held at Ottawa, announced here that it will press for a republi- can form of Government and a nation-wide referendum on the issue. At a Press conference here Mr. Guy Wilson, president of the federation said that Quebec's Young Liberals believe that a republic headed by a strong President-on the U.S. model- was the most efficient and repre- sentative form of Government. Mr. Wilson said that a referendum should be held within two yairs. SThe Quebec delegates ta their ,r1 l _ . l MONTREAL. Sept. 28. official presentation at the Party's National Congress will also call on it to adopt the Republican proposal as official policy. Quebec Young Liberals said that the present system has many faults, the major one being that the Prime Minister and his Cabinet Ministers must also be repre- sentatives of their various home con- stituencies and that the two jobs can- not be properly managed by one man. Mr. Wilson also noted that the Prime Minister is not elected by all of the voters, but is selected by his fellow MvI.P.s, a procedur which was not truly democratic. The Quebct Young Liberals say changing the situation will certainly lead to noisy debate and'may even split the country, but that there exists in Canada an abscess which must be lanced and that this is the way.it must be done.",

GE is said to have controlled about 50 per cent of the total American light bulb market with sales of over $173m. in 1963. In the suit, filed in the Federal Court, the Justice Department has charged GE with holding bulb prices at \"artificially high levels,\" with restricting price competition and with preventing distributors and retailers from selling at prices and on terms that they select. It requests the Court to'enjois GE permanently from enforcin- agreements that lead to thes- restraints, and generally from set. ting any restrictions on prices oi conditions of sale for light bulbs, The Justice Department attack is directed at so-called agency agreements through which GE, in effect, provides that light bulbs remain its property until they ar\" sold to small retailers or to final users. In fact, the Department has twice .previously challenged these agreements only to be defeated in the Courts. In response to the suit. Mr. Robert M.-Estes, the vice-presideni and general counsel for GE, noted that \"the agency method of distri butin, lamps has. been repeatedly apr6oved by the Courts.and used by the company for over 50 years.\" He added that \"General Electric will co-operate with the Depart- ment fully in the hope that the new Court test will resolve this complicated legal matter once and for all.\" For its part, the Department con- cedes that GE's agency agreements were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1926 and by a Federal District Court in New -Jersey in 1953, but now argues that \"those earlier cases were decided errone- ously and that more recent court decisions, including those of the Supreme Court, have changed the law.\" The Department did not spell out, however, to which recent MEW YORK, Sept. 28. Supreme Court decisions it was re- ferring, pointing out merely that its suit did not challenge the legality of agency agreements as such but rather the use of these agreements to fix prices or to restrain trade. Following the GE indictment a number of retail trade sources in New York indicated that even with GE's agency agreements prices for that company's light bulbs were generally about the same as those of its competitors though one de- partment store official noted that GE's prices cannot be reduced. The Justice Department suit indi- cated that GE's sales under agency agreements accounted for over three-quarters of its total bulb sales in 1963.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "From Our Owa Cormpondent NEW YORK, Sept. 28. AS THE credit squeeze tightens its grip on domestic industry, business economists in the U.S. are becoming increasingly apprehensive about the economic outlook for 1967. In a poll of members prior to the opening in Washington to-morrow of its annual conven- tion, the National Association of Business Economists found the majority still confident that business activity would expand further next year, though the view was widespread that the pace will be slower than in either 1965 or 1966. Asked additionally whether they expected a recession between 1966 and 1970, 72 per cent. of the respondents said they did and almost 50 per cent predicted that the current economic boom will peak out around' the middle of next year. The NABE counts about 800 members, many of them econo- mists from major American busi- ness organisations who advise their chief executives and can often influence corporate policies. In the past these economists have gener- ally been oblivious of the more adverse indicators in expressing their enthusiasm about the healthy U.S. economy and, following a joyful first annual convention in Philadelphia in 1959, many of them were surprised as the economy started to slacken its pace of growth in the spring of 1960. The median forecast in the NABE poll was for a growth national product of S781.000m. in 1967 compared with $738,000m. indicated for this year. This fore- cast provides for an increase of S43,000m. in the GNP eat year, as against one of $57,000m. be- tween 1965 and 1966. Most of the economists expected rising defence expenditures to be the principal contributor to the continued growth in GNP, with these expenditures influenced by the Vietnamese war estimated to increase by more than S7.000m. over an indicated SS8.000m. for 1966. But those NABE members who are fearful of a recession ahead appear more concerned about the harm being done to business by tight money and high interest rates than about the impact of any future cut-back in defence spending. Under the influence of the credit squeeze. the economists predicted that after tax profits of American companies will reach a peak around the,middle of next year and then fall off slightly, while they also expect the capital spending boom by private business to peter out after the third quarter of 1967. Reviewing tha. overall outlook, eanwhile, the economists felt that : most important economic prob m to be resolved next year will a that of controlling inflation *hile avoiding recession, addina hat this problem is likely to b implicated by the adverse balance Spayments, labour unrest and the Iofits squeeze. The 72 per cent. f respondents, however who pre- lct a recession within the next five ars, suggest as the principal cause reduction in capital spending by usiness as a result of the appear- ince of excess capacity. As they have been all year, the :conomists were highly critical of he Johnson Administration for eing too sparing in its use of fiscal olicy to guide the pace of econo- iic growth. Whereas a year ago iore than half of the NABE members felt that fiscal policies -ere \" about right,\" 50 per cent.- gainst 4 per cent. in 1966-now eel that they are \" much too easy.\"",

   "text_content" : "TORONTO, Sept. 28. DESPITE ALL the fears about in- flation expressed by Prime Minister Lester Pearson and his Minister of Finance, Mr. Mitchell Sharp, the latest figures issued by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in- dicate a marked slowing down in the pace of economic expansion during the second quarter of this year and the trend toward a more moderate rate of growth continued into the third quarter. The drop in the economy's tem- perature has led banking and in- surance economists in Canada to the view that the economy is no longer stretched to the limits of its capacity, and this may be expected to influence the extent of defla- tionary measures that will be in- cluded in the supplementary budget to be brought down later this year by the Minister of Finance. Some economists think it may be unnecessary for the Budget to do more than raise enough additional taxes to pay for new Government commitments. Evidence that thle boom ;apears to be cooling is provided by the following seasonally adjusted Â° From Our Own Correspondent statistics supplied by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.

The four-month decline in he flow of new orders brought a mar- inal month-to-month reduction in uly in the backlog of unfilled orders. The decline in unemployment, which by April had reduced the rate o 3.3 per cent. of the labour force, :as reversed in May and by July the easonally adjusted jobless rate was .1 per cent., the highest in 12 months. Other statistics show a similar rend. Steel production in August at 74,094 tons was down 19 per cent. rom August, 1965. Urban housing tarts in July were 26 per cent. below tarts a year earlier and in the first seven months of 1966 were down 20.3 er cent from last, year. Exports, vhich contributed strongly to the fast rise in output during the first quarter, se by 1i73 per cent. in the frst seven months of 1966, but the year-to-year gain in July narrowed to 8.11 per cent. mm11 1m| aIm mra mnmmm",

The following is the Annual Re- view and the Statement by the Chairman, The RT. HON. TH EARL OF INCHCAPE, which have been circulated with the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1966: ANNUAL REVIEW 196/66 The Accounts As shown by the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account the Group Profit for the year ended 31st March, 1966, before charging taxa- tion. was Â£964,506 including Â£132,808 dividends from the sub- sidiaries in India. Taxation absorbed Â£204,985 and, after de- ducting minority interests of Â£115,990, the taxed profit attribut- able to Inchcape & Co. Limited was Â£643,531. Retentions by subsidiaries (other than those in India) were Â£356,905, leaving Â£286,626 for dis- posal by the holding company. The taxed profit attributable to Inchcape & Co. Limited of the sub- sidiaries in India was Â£305,972. of which Â£185,786 was paid as divi- dends (which are included above after providing Â£52,978 loss on ex- change arising on dividends re- mitted after devaluation of the Indian rupee on 6th June, 1966), leaving Â£120,186 retained in India. An interim dividend of Is. 3d. per share, less tax, was paid on'31st March, 1966, absorbing Â£124.588 and the Board has recommended a final dividend of Is. Od. per share gross, less\" one year surplus\" relief which will be claimed under Sec- tion 85, Finance Act, 1965, absorb- ing Â£l14,733 and leaving Â£27,305, which has been transferred to reserve in the holding company's accounts. The major change in the com- position of the Group has been the merger by Inchcape & Co. Limited sad Dalgety and New Zealand Lam Limited of their businesses in East Africa, namely, the Smith Mackenzie & Company Limited Group aad the Dalgety (East Africa) Limited Group respec- tively. This was effected by the formation of a new company, Mackenzie Dalgety Limited, m which each has a 50 per cent. shareholding and which has acquired the whole of the share capitals of Smith Mackenzie & Company Limited and Dalgety (East Africa) Limited. The in- clusion of Dalgety (East Africa) Limited's figures in the Cdnsoli- lated Balance Sheet has resulted in material increases in certain Balance Sheet items and the sub- stantial increase in Minority In- terests largely reflects the 50 per cent, interest of Dalgety and New Zealand Loan Limited in the com- bined East African Group. U.K. Finance Act, 1968 Under the new tax system intro. duced by the Finance Act, 1965, the liability of companies to income tax and profits tax has been replaced by corporation tax and the necessity for companies to account to the Inland Revenue for income tax deducted from divi- dends paid to Members, In addi- tion the status of \"overseas trade corporations \" has been abolished with effect from 6th April, 1966. As partial alleviation of these additional burdens, the Finance Act, 1965. provides two transi- tional reliefs, namely the \" one year surplus\" and \"overspill.\" The first takes into account that divi- dends payable in 1966/67 may partly be paid from profits which have borne income tax in the pre- vious year and the second gives relief to companies with overseas trading income, this latter relief being subject to a number of com- plicated restrictions and being pro- gressively reduced from 1969 until it disappears in 1973. In relation to a Group such as this, these reliefs are not capable of exact determination at this stage and in the accounts Â£34,919 provisional \"one year surplus\" has been utilised to reduce the cost of the final dividend and Â£100,000 esti- mated \"overspill\" relief has been used to reduce the charge for taxa- tion. Income tax deducted from franked investment income may be set off against the liability of Inch- cape & Co. Limited to account to the Inland Revenue for income tax deducted from its own dividends. The income from investments for the year under review included Â£303,805. which would have been franked investment income if received after 5th April, 1966, but this figure includes larger dividends than normal which have been de- clared for tax reasons, and it is therefore to be expected that this figure will be less for the current year. Inchcape & (do. Limited is at present a \"close company \" for the purpose of the Finance Act, 1965, but these provisions so far as dis- tributions are concerned do not apply to the year under review, and it is reasonably certain that the Group's heavy cash requirements and its present rate of distribution will not give rise to assessments to income tax and surtax on deemed distributions in the fore- seeable future. United Kingdom Gray, Dawes & Company Limited, which celebrated its cen- tenary in 1965, now offers, and is active in. virtually the wholerange of merchant bankilg services and its trading department continues to expand from its traditional role of servicing group companies into an overseas merchanting organisation, specialisig in the East and Africa. Gray liwes, Weitray & Comn' any Limited, the Lloyd s nsurance broking house equally owned by Inchcape & Co. and the P. & 0., made further progress and again produced Improved results. In furtherance of its expansion policy, the acquisition of a controlling interest in an important Australian broking house has recently been successfully negotiated. St. Mary Axe Securill Limited he market value o rtn specia holdin dlid the value of the neral portfolio showed a satisfactory increase. Demn Maell *& Cameam Uriked-The arnings of this tea agency subsidiary increased satis- ctorily while expense we hebld at the prvious year's level thus proding a somewhat higher trad i p)roit. The crop outtrn of the agency tea estates for 1965 was somewhat less than the record outturn during the previous year. This compar- tive fall in yields, which resulte from less favourable weather con ditions, was expeenced by most producers in North East IndL- Unfortunatel, there was a decli-n in the price levels achieved in th London auctions but this was par- tially offset by a better respobse iu the Calcutta auctions where price to have benefited from the increasing .- demand of local consumption in i.

Nevertheless, costs have e continued to rise largely du to : higher wage bills, subsidies for i- foodstuffs and increases in the costs a of materials and overheads gener- t ally. In the absence of any coin- i- mensurate enhancement of auction prices over recent years, the inevi- table result has been a general - decline in profitability throughout the tea industry in North East - India. of The year 1965 was, of course, i- overshadowed by the hostilities in o* September between India and il Pakistan, which resulted in the n closure of the river route from & Assam and the seizure in East ct Pakistan waters of 7,558 chests of i agencies' teas en route to Calcutta 1 Insurance covering such an.even- In tuality had been effected under the e Government of India's Emergency i- Risks Insurance Scheme, and nepo- m tiations are in process regarding a- settlement of the claim. India \" The underlying political prob - lems between India and Pakistan, to which last year's Review t referred, are still unresolved and x continue to affect the Indian \". economy. India has announced a substantial devaluation of th Srupee which became effective o- S6th June, 1966. Increased exports \" and a reduction in the high level Sos imports are among the objects of devaluation. There will be many - problems to deal with but it must - be hoped that a lasting settlement \" with Pakistan can be achieved and I that with renewed foreign aid and the marshalling of internal re- Ssources, commerce and industry ewill forge ahead in the years to Scome. t Macnem & Barry Limited.- d There was a substantial increase in Sthe commissions and dividend in- Scome from the tea companies as a n result of the more favourable Strading conditions in 1964 on the n results of which year such income is based, and in the profitability of the company's agency department. Income from the managed jute and coal companies was, however, re- M duced due to adverse trading con- Sditions in these industries. It was s necessary to change the basis of go providing for staff bonuses and. as d a result, the company's accounts o bear a charge for two years. O Largely as a result of this, the Soperating profit for 1965 was lower IN than in- 964. n The development of aew pro . jtects has shown continued improve- mont although production was ) affected by a shortage of raw- i materials. Strenuous efforts are I being made to ensure an adequate ' supply of essential raw materials \" and components and action is Sbeing taken to make the best po- . sible use of resolrces in short Supply. 1965 was, hobwver, a diffi Scult year and many of its problem. remain to be dealt with. It was mentioned last year that renewals of the company's man- aging agency agreements had been granted for varying limited period. giving time for an examination of alternative forms of management. This examination continues. Last year it' W reported that the Government of India had taken over control of Tht Rivers Steam Navigation Company Limited in February, 196, but that the Inch- cape Group remained associated with that company by a sharehold. Ing which cost the Indian ru-e- equivalent of Â£128,325. Since then this company has continued to make heavy losses and was seri- ously affeoted by the 'closure of the river route through Pakistan fol, lowing the outbreak of hostilities last year and the detention of ., largg proportion of the fleet In Pakistan waters An appPilaton is before the High Court of Cal cutta for the wi-ndin-up of this company's affain In India. The Inchne Grou in India had debts equivalent i the former rate of exchange to \"400,5S owlnl by The Rivers team Navgtion Company Limited and, whils it is hoped that some recoverery may be forthcom- ing It had been deemed prudant to make provision against this In. debtedness and for writinlsoff the shares, Of the total provision of Â£329,320.

The trading profits were much lower than for the previous year owing to. aterially increaMd costs of pro- duction, particularly that ,of wges, =nd the'coatinuance of price and production controls by Govern- znd. Cc TuTnoerW was lower .due. to,,the lack of 'Government orders and a snorage of wool supplies. Trading profits -were reducd because o increaed produetion costs ind controls on price and production. Althouh the reults of both ith miUcompanies. were disappoeninU compared with lrevious years,'they -ere appr by better than so most of thIndian extil industry, thanks larely to the popuarity, of their products and their well developed distribution system. The Iadras mills in particular again benefited by baving their own power plant which helped them to maintain full production during a long period of drought, when many other mills, particularly in the South, suffered severe power cuts. Both companies continue to concentrate on increasing produ- tivityand on developing their plans for plant modernisation. Binny's Engineering Works lnmited in Madras had an unprofi- able year, mainly due to a dearth of orders for sugar-making machinery. It has, however, greatly increased its productive capacity, and has also achieved , some measure of diversification, and these two factors, combined with a' most useful improvement in the inflow of orders, should be reflected in an increased turnover during 1966. Indeed, the prospects for thi. company in the long term are more promising. Glovanola-Blony Limited.--or this company 1965 was the first year of full production of pen stocks at Cochin and of erection work at hydro-electric projects ir South India. The result was an excellent profit. Although the company is believed now to be the biggest manufacturer anywhere of this equipment, and there are good orders for penstocks in .band and in prospect for several years ahead. it has been decided that it would be unwise to rely on filling the capacity of the factory with this type of work alone. Plans are, therefore, under active considera tion for developing the present in stallation in order to produce also items of plant for the chemical. fertiliser and other rowing indus tries in India, which are in con siderable demand. Pakistan The profitof Macaeml * Klbo. Linited was again lower becaus of reduced income for management services in East Pakistan and the effect on trading activities of the conflict between Pakistan and India in the latter part of the year As regards the managed comr panies, the difficult trading condi tions which faced Pakistan River Steamers Limited a year ago con- tinue and were in fact aggravated from September onwards. Con- -ideration is being given to a r- organisation of the passenger ser- vices run by that company. Star Jute Mills Limited in Khulna has had a good year and a satisfactory profit has been earned. Plans for the construction of a second mill are well advanced and tl is hoped to go into produc- tion by July, 1967. Irq, Iraiiand the Gul Sttess Gay, Macknoie * .Company Linltsd.-Apart from one or two minot incidents, the political situa- tion throughout the Gulf remained stable.

The Common Services and the Common Market continue to exist, with certain changes envisaged. The report of the Commission on East African Co-operation under the Chairmanship of Professor Philip is still awaited and it is hoped that their endeavours to seek new ways of strengthening and de- veloping East African economic co-operation and improving the operations of the Services will be successful. It is satisfactory to report that the level of trading of Smnith Mackenzie & Company Limited was well maintained, with the last quarter of the period under review showing a marked improvement, with consequent increase in over- all profits. As stated in the Report of the Directors, a new company, Mac- keazie Dalgety Limited, has been formed to merge, with effect from 1st June, 1965, the interests of Dal- gety (East Africa) Ltd. and Smith Mackenzie & Co. Ltd, in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The contribution of Dalgety (East Afrim) Limited and its sub- sidiaries to the profits of the year under review was not material but it is confidently expected that con- siderable benefits will be derived in future years from the merged businesses. With the changing political and economic pattern in East Africa it is felt this association will provide a high degree of efficiency in administration and maximum utili- sation of resources and lead to trading and financial advantages to the benefit of all three territories in progressing their industrial, commercial and agricultural deve- lopment. Musekera Estates Limited.-At the end of last year an improve- ment in climatic conditions caused the crop of this tea estate in Tan- zania to increase sharply and this increase has been maintained dur- ing the first three months of this Syear. The quality of the teas con- tinues to improve and quite good sale prices are now regularly being achieved. Karlran Estates Lhmited.-This young tea estate in Kenya con- tinues to make satisfactory pro- gress and the good name which it has earned in the London auctions has been well maintained. Australs Macdonald Hamilton & Co. Ply. Limited In Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane together with its sub- sidiary and associated companies showed Improved results, The company's operations in the travel agency business and associated activities continued at a satisfac- tory level despite keen competi- tion. The export department of Macdonald Haiuilton made good progress and the company is now established in this new activity. The Brisbane workshop of A.U..N. (Australl) Pty. Limited maintained a high level of marine and industrial activity throughout the year and produced a satisfacr tory result. The removal of the Sydney workshop to its new premises has brought about cer- tain difficulties in the first months of operation and, despite a higher turnover, the resuits for the year were disappointing.

At the mompt. nowever, we are inhibited both by the damaging effects of U.K. Cor. poration Tax on our overseas trading companies and by the Chancellor'e request to. strict substantially new overseas nvest ment in developed countries. I am happy to say, however, that In all the overseas areas in which we operate we have sufficalet local resources available to take advan- tage of inmmediate dvelopments; and we hope that the present estrictions on overseas investment, whether they be direct or indirect, will be lifted as soon as tne balance of payments improves. Meantime we are developing our existing business in this country and are continuing to look for new iGlds for investment here. Although the results of the year under review have not experienced the full effects of the new tax legislation, I must again emphasise the unfairness of the Chancellor's decision to impose increased taxa- Lion on Groups like ours with existing overseas investments, which have been built up over the last century in India, Pakistan, Australia. the Middle East and Africa, and which have contributed very large sums to the balance of payments, not only by way of dividends and capital repayments over the years, but also by the trade generated with this country and by its beneficial effect on exports. In mitigation of. these additional tax burdens. we shall eeive 'overspill relief.' That is welcome, but it has a limited -uration. As the Annual Review cove- very fully the operations of. th. Group, it only remains for me to mention one or two special poiint and give some indication of future prospects. We welcomed, as did all in this country with knowledge of India and Pakistan, the Tashkent discus .ions. These discussions brought these two great countries together. under the leadership of Shri Lai Bahadur Shastri and of President Ayub Khan. I trust sincerely, despite the difficulties which still iave to be faced, that there will emerge from them, even it may be after an interval, a happy answer to the problems, the resolution of which is so vital to the prosperity and happiness of both countries. India has lost a great national figure in Shri Lal Bahaduir hastri, and to his distingdished. 'uccesor,. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, we extend, our warmest good wishes. Devaluation of the Indian rupee has already been referred to in the Annual Review and I need hardly say that we heard of it with great nreret. It has borne heavily on our expatriate staffs in that country, In the financial field it is not easy to accept a cut of 36.5 per cent, in dividends from the 3roup in Indlia. But our regret is tempered by the hope and belief that this realistic measure will sslst In bringing about a strength ening of the Indian economy and that our businesses in India will, when this has been achieved, share in the expected Improvement in trade with and within India.

The following is the statement by the Chairman, Ma. R. G. MaLTwoo, circulated with the Report and Accounts. The period covered by our Accounts.for the year ended 31t July, 1946, ba bein particularly notable for the new system of com pany taxation contained in the Finance Act 1965. which intro- duced corporation tax and the new form of capital gains tax. This Act also provided so the re.negotiation of double taxation agreements with other countries of which. the most important, that with the U.SA. is the only one so far completed. Before dealing with the accounts, I think it might be of assistance to stockholders for me to give some explanation of the effects of this nw legislation so far as this company is concerned. For the year to 31st July, 1965, our revenue suffered income tax at 79d for eight months and for the balance of the financial year from 5th Apri, 1965, onwards, at 8/3d. In addition, profits tax at 15 per cnt. Was levied throughout the whole period. We continued to be taxable under the old system until 5th April, 1966 but became liable to corporation tax from that date for the balance of the financial year to 31st July, 1966. The effect of the foregoing is that we have been deprived of the beneit of two-thirds of our Management expenses relief claim Im this year, that is for the period from the 1st August, 1965, to 5th April, 1966, and furthermore, have suffered deduction of income tax amounting to Â£14227 from franked investment income received since 6th April, 1966. This amount, how. ever, will be credited against the income tax liability in respect of future distributions. In addition, we shall not have to account to the Inland Revenue for the income tax on the final dividends now recom- mended nor indeed on the interim dividends to be paid next Match. In effect, -our liability for income tax on distributions is likely to be reduced for the next few years. In these accounts, corporation tax has been charged at 40 per cent. but the actual rate applicable will not be known until the Finance Act, 1967. The double tax convention with the U.S.A. has been re-negotiated on terms which are. much less favourable to us. Briefly, under the old double tax convention the effective gross yield to us on American income was about 40 per cent. more than the American yield but under the new convention, the gross yield to us is no more than the American yield and this is further reduced by the liability to Corporation Tax. This may prove to b.,the pattern for other coun- tries whe' jsimilar asge&nts are re-negotiafQ, and come Into eff.et, From what I have said, stock* holders will appreciate that a direct comparison cannot be made, be tween the accounts we are' con- sidering today and thoe of previous years. The gross revenue for the year to 31st July, 1966, amounts to Â£287681, being an increase of Â£3,003 or 1.04 per cent.. as com- pared with last year. This increase would have been considerably reater but tor the reduction in ouble taxation relief to which I have just referred. There is available for the Ordin- ary stock after all expenses, pro. visions or taxation, debenture interest and preference dividends, the sum of Â£109,163, equivalent to earnins of 19.55 per cent, as compard with Â£115,636 r earn- pigsof 0.29 per cent. for the previous year Our ros income from the United ngdom section of the portfolo has been Inflated this year by approximately 4,500 as a resultof companies making addi tional dlitributons before the Sth April, 1966, in order to minimise the initial effeet of the new taxa- ton legislation. This fiure would have aen consderably larger if our nanolal year had ended one or two month earlier. The reverse effect will be felt in the current year when we are likely to receive m than normal by much the same amount, Lalt year we paid dividends totalling 161 per cent. In addl.

For the year to 31st July, 1966. the company had no set liability to capital gains tax. The balance sheet value of the -, investments is Â£2,895,302. The market valuation as at 31st July, i966, at Â£4,356,429, is equivalent to an appreciation of 50.5 per cent. In arriving at this valuation the dollar premium has been taken at the ful rate of 25% per cent An increasing number of Investment Trusts are now adopting this method of presentation as it shows -ore clearly the full value of the assets working for the company .ut it must be remembered as a esult of the Exchange Control Regulations introduced in April 1965, there is a contingent liability on the sale of relevant securities to forfeit 25 per cent. of the dollar premium. The net asset value per Ordinary 5/- stock unit (ex dividend) on this basis is approximately 17/23d which compares with 16/6Yd at this time last year if full premium had then been included. The 25 per cent. contingent liability of the dollar premium this year is equiva. lent to 3%d per stock unit. The total number of investments / -t 583 is a little less than last year. 'he analysis shows a slight reduc- tion in the United States mainly from utilities and the finance sec- tion and little change elsewhere. The percentage in fixed interest is lower, on the other hand short term deposits are increased by Â£90,000. Your directors consider in present conditions that it is essential to maintain some liquidity to enable them to take advantage of any favourable opportunities for invest-, ment which may arise in the future.,' With a view to equalising as far as possible the amounts distributed by way of Ordinary dividend in each half-year, the Directors would expect to increase the next interim dividend to 8% per cent. In view of the dividend standstill which obtains until July, 1967, this must not be taken as any indication of an intention to increase the total distribution for the year. There could seldom have been an occasion when it is more diffi cult to assess with any degree of confideose the prospects for the next twelve months. There has not ben sufficiet . time to know -hether the recent Government jI measures will achieve the required mnount of deflation to put the economy back in balance and so restore the confidence of the world in sterling and prove that the British people, as a whole, have the will to surmount their present difficulties. The high level of interest rates which prevails both at home and abroad is p)acing a brake on econo- mic growth and this is reflected in the level of stock markets gener- ally. For, the various reasons I have indicated, particularly those con- nected with taxation, your Direc- tors are well aware of the need to maintain a flexible investment policy. They believe furthermore, unless economic conditions become borse than at present seems likely, that the present rate of dividend Bin be maintained with a reason- able margin of earnings.",

Only the Americans outdo them. But appearances can deceive-accord- ins to figures from the Association of the German Photographic Industry, people in Britain actually spend more on photography an the Germans do. Photographic sales of all kinds, amateur and pro. sessional, work out at about Â£1 16s 3d annually a head in Britain and only Â£1 13s lid in Germany. The Americans are well ahead with per caput expenditure of Â£3 10s. Narrowing that American lead will be the job of the Photokina fair opening in Cologne on October 1. No bigger exhibition of photo- graphic goods exists this side of the Atlantic. It is a fair in both senses of the word: a trade fair where serious business is done, and a huge publicity show with keen amateurs storming the stands and wearing out the staff with unend- ing questions about the latest gadgetry. Last time the Photokina was held, in 1963, more than 200.000 people passed through the turnstiles. The figure was kept down only by closing the grounds to all but trade visitors on three mornings. The same restriction will be in force this time. The show will have three focal points of interest: the simplifica- tion of amateur photography in order to reach new layers in the market; the arrival on the German scene of amateur cine photography as a factor of major importance; and the battle between the Germans and Japanese for world markets. In the U.S.. the world's biggest amateur photo market, the battle has gone badly for the Germans and may in fact be lost. although a measure of compensation has been found in France. In 1964, for the first time,, the Japanese out- sold the Germans in the U.S. and last year bagged 30.8 per cent. share of the total import bill of S112m. The Germans had to be content with 25.1 per cent. For many years. the Germans had not been fully competitive in the lower price brackets. But now the Japanese are getting on top even in the quality market, not on price but by greater attention to- the American love for technical refinement. Conservative German makers are. inclined to.look upoP much of that love as mere WORLD PHOTOGRAPHIC MARKETS, 1965 Country Â£m. U.S. ............. 68C Britain ............ 98 W. Germany .........

Similar divisions exist in the German domestic market-on the one hand a conservative school in- terested in the serious amateur who buys a quality camera from a specialist dealer; and on the other a school of thought which sees salvation come from the takers of snap shots-the more the snappier It is this school which has mad- the running of late and the total of 1,200m. amateur photograph- thought to have been taken in Ger many last year is evidence to its success. Technical trends have chimed in with the needs of the mass market-automatic exposure, easy cassette loading or suu cameras. So have marketing methods. Companies which with- held their products from depart. ment stores and other non- specialists are now resigned to see- ing them on their shelves. The Polaroid \"Swinger\" which produces almost instant black and white prints, has given a special accent to this drive for amateurs who care little for technical com- plication. Regiments of Swingers have been deployed in the shop windows. The price label says about Â£7-cheaper than the same camera is in Britain. The same ob- servation goes for most other photographic goods, even where the British price is not inflated by im- port duty. * The trend towards simplicity has also given impetus to sales of amateur cine cameras. Total domestic sales came to 83,000 in the first six months of this year against 41.000 in January-June of 1965. Production also very nearly doubled to 66,000. Exports were up by 38 per cent. to 43,000, imports by 56 per cent. to 60.000. Growth has almost entirely been confined to the Super-8 format introduced by Kodak, which avoids he need to run each reel through the camera twice. Some manufac- turers are beginning to phase out production of the old format and retailers have heavily marked down much double-8 equipment. Britain has only a tiny share in Germany's photographic imports, although Ilford films have a good reputation among the more know- ledgeable amateurs and dealers. Now Ilford, in association with Ciba, of Switzerland, has brought onto the German market the Ilfo. print system which produces a finished enlargement in 10 seconds.

This is the main conclusion of a detailed study carried out by EFTA on the effects of the elimin- ation of tariffs on prices, which has just been completed and will shortly be published. The last step in the removal of all tariffs on trade between EFIA countries will be taken at the end of this year. Mr. d'Oliveira told the Consulta. tive Assembly that in the face of a general inflationary trend, the cut in tariffs had had the effect of restrain- ing the rise in prices of many goods and had often resulted in actual reductions in prices. In many cases the effects of the EFTA tariff cuts have been multiplied by forcing both domestic producers and suppliers from outside the Euro- pean Free Trade Association to cut their prices to meet the tougher com- petition. This matching of tariff cuts by !hird-coatry ,suppliers is reported to be particularly .striking in Sweden, 5 IKASBUUKU, Sept. 28. where German manufacturers have consistently kept pace with price cuts on British goods, and have thus in. creased their sales to Sweden faster than the U.K. In Switzerland, on the other hand, there is apparently clear evidence that the tariff cuts have resulted in a fall in the price index of EFTA goods, at the same time as a rise in the price index for Common Market goods. The. EFTA study is considerably more detailed than anything so far attempted by the Common Market, but its conclusions are hedged around with many qualifications, partl be. cause of the inadequacy aaable retail Pe data, for example in the 'U .K. ., ,. & . .",

FRAwCIs W. Douse (Chairman) announced the Bbard's inteption to appoint, as a Diretor, Mr. ' .. P. G. White, who had served the Company as General Manager in Mauritius. Mr. Douse continued: Mauritus When I met you last year I menitioned that our receipts from Mauritius might be considerably lower that those for the year ended March, 1965. Unfortunately, this forecast turned out to be correct, despite the fact that the Company's Estates, including Mon Tresor & SMon Desert Ltd. produced 73.290 tons of sugar compared with 52500 tons in 1964, this figure being within 5.000 tons of our record crop for 1963. Sugar recovery was poor, con- sidering the .tonnage of canes crushed, due to excessive rainfall during the growing period and, in addition, after meeting Export Duty, Insurance Fund contribu- tions and other levies, we only Sreceived Rs.409 per ton (i.e. ap- proximately Â£30 per ton) as against Rs.433 per ton (approximately Â£32 10s. Od.) for the previous year. This price of Rs.409 per ton was the lowest we have received for 15 years and goes right back to conditions ruling in the immediate post-war period prior to the intro- duction of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which has been so valuable and, happily, has been extended annually and at present runs on until 1973. This condition of affairs resulted in a considerable drop in the earn- ings of .the Company as a whole and we only earned a dividend of approximately 10%, as against 16% last year. As I mentioned in my Statement in the printed Report, this dividend was declared in two sections--8 % out of current ' earnings and 2% from past profits, and this was primarily done be- Scause at the time we declared our dividend for the year, we were not certain of the final figures and were not inclined to declare a divi- dend in excess of the actual earn- ings of the Company for the- year. However. it so happened that we could have paid the whole 10% out of earnings, had we known our actual results earlier. The fact that we bad past profits out of which we could have de- clared dividends might have caused SShareholders to wonder why we did not declare more than 2%, but had we paid an aggregate of ,more Sthan 10% in dividends, the effect would have been a heavy payment ,over to.the Inland Revenue for no purpose whatsoever except to affect f the Shareholders' interests adversely. r- e Pr wet for 19~ Disappointin a u the results were or the 965 Sugar Crop, J L am afraid that those covering the S1966 Crop now being harvested a may well be even more disappoint- ing. After a promising sart, the cyclone experienced J .anuary r and a severe drought in April and May have reulted in a substantial reductiba in antloipated yields with the result that pt nt Indicatiolis I are that the Isaliat tal crop will be in the region of S80,000 tons as against an origi estimate of S685,000 tons. .Our :Estates, with . the rest. will, of coul, suffer, but it is expected that there will be a measure of compensation under Sthe Island's Cyclone and Drought SInsurace Scheme which wil miti- p ate to. a. ertai\" extent the loss in receipts which il incurred, although o lsser estent than in past years,: \"** - In..addition to -thelower receipts. from 'sugar sales, there is the Smatter of taxation and, in this connection, ith will be recollected Sthat the benefits which the Com- pany had when designated as an Overseas Trade Corporation have now disappeared and. in addition Sto this, Corporation Tax has been inaugurated. Tax in the Accounts , under review has been calculated in accordance with the provisions Sapplicable before the alterations r recently introduced and, if one Scould assume the same profits for next year as for this, provision Sfor tax will certainly be higher. At the worst, it could mean that a dividend of 8% would cost the t Company Â£312.000 as against Â£183,300 in the Accounts now before you, but, fortunately, certain transitional reliefs operat- ing in a diminishing quantity in subsequent years will materially mitigate the liability for next year, t leaving an extra amount to be pro I vided of something like Â£40,000. SI hope you will appreciate that I these figures can only be regarded t as a very rough estimate, but they will give you some idea of the burden the Company will have to r bear by the adoption of a system t which virtually represents double I taxation. So much for the results for the Spast year and a rough estimate of prospects for the current year. Review of Past Year's Events Now, as regards events during r the past year, you will recollect that 1 referred last year to the Con- s ference which was held early in Sthe Autumn of 1965 when the case i of Mauritius for Independence was a discussed and the decision arrived it at was that, subject to new Elec- e tions being held following the re- t port of an Electoral Commission, it Independence would, if demanded a by the successful party in the *t Elections, be granted by the pass- u' ruling P ay in Couna u w as ,ertan thr sections of th Elecoted. MNamn bdrs and strong rapsetatints wt re a ,t to e S.retary o*: SWa for. te C loies for a recon- sidstation or the findings of the re- rt, despite the fact that they haU been accepted in tote by the Minister himself. Under pressur' he decided that an attempt should be made to smooth over the dffi cultl' which had been pe ate s and a small (slgatlon u~4i the- Chairnaashi of Mr. .,ohn Stonehous. P., wa ent out to -t Mauritiut.o meet all the Prties I concerned and to endetvor, to Sreach a settlement acceptable to p - concerned. Fortunately, thli*. . Sab't. and slght alterations in th- rom ndationu .in . ot'ReplOrt were made and W left die old open_ i for a General Election to take Splace. It will be sen that th.e was a considerable delay In the , timing of the process of obtaining 1 Independence, when it was first Sexpected the Election would be Sheldin Mgy oi Tune 1966, but, as i t turn out, it seems that there Swill be no Election now tuntil early Sin 1967, This situation cannot be r viewed with any complacency. i In the mdantime, the Budget usually produced in June was held . up and I believe it was. the SPremier's intention that it should ; not be preented until after th Election, but, with the delay to t, which I have referred, it became. a in his opinion, necessary to prc Sduce a Budget, be it somewhat later d than usual. In a very lucid and detailed state= n ment, the Premier disclosed a - deficit in the neighbourhood of i Rs.25 million and by the 'imposi- tion of further taxes on-individuals ts and additional indirect taxation, he i took measures to balance his s Budget without directly imposing a further taxation on, the Sugar 3 Industry itself, but the fact remains. r that the middle classes in Mauritius - are.now to suffer quite an apprc Sciable increase in the taxes they t have to pay, even without indirect t taxation and, overall, the cost of t production to the Sugar Industry w must be affected adversely. A Serins Situation S The stage has now been reached y when something must be done to , stop the threatened paralysis of the SMauritius Sugar Industry and I D. suppose it can be said that, t Revenue-wise. it is indeed a very j long time since the situation in y Mauritius has been so serious. It Sis a fact that, due to climatic con *. ditions, the World Price of sugar, and the lack of available land for le expansion, the revenue from sugar. with the exception of the year 1963. 3 has remained static over the past I ten years, but, during this period wage rates have increased by approximately 75%. whilst indirect Scharges and the cost of supplies Shave risen appreciably. During Sthe same decade. Government has . re-doubled its current expenditure Swhich- has, of course, required s higher taxes and levies, most of d which have had to be borne by the SSugar Industry. S I think we should have some ,sympathy with the Government in i the difficiTties It has to face wiith e an estimated increase in the popu- s. lation of Mauritius at its preent rate. of growth from 750.000 inhabitants to more than a million by 1980 in an Island of approxi mately 720 square miles. With some 50% of the population under the age of 15, an alarming picture is presented in respect of those seeking employment on a market already unable to cope with the pressures upon it. However, some way must be found out of these ) very serious difficulties, but. in t findindg &- solution, Government simply must adopt a constructiv- r and .helpful pollcy towards the I &lad's main Industry and should il show signs of willingness to freeze a wagesind to refrain rom imposing Spty. further imposts on the cost of Sproduction., . . Ooitament's Attitude his -been -in the past a SfeeJlrq, ip Government circles that the Su1t iMlers have made very .' . hrge'rioits. At times. profits cr. Stnly have been ood, but an mMl amount o .money has Sbean poured back into modernising Sfact ies and geral development. b hu, hatever may have happened Injth:i past, the fact remains that, to ,date, Sugar Companies In . MIrlitilus are pretty well at the end . of itblr tether, and there can be no S..ettlng blood out of a stone. I am itW not happy that Government is properly aware that the Sugar Companies In Maurltlus are bein to be fttful tful.\" \" - With theb situatida' is it' is, the' cash position in the island is very tight and looks,lie being so for some time. Hereid lies the danger that resort may have to be made to further borrowing over and above existing indebtedness but I suggest that any such borrownag be kept to an abso- lute minimum and, if at all pos- sible, it should be for production purposes,aonly,. Is iFPt uch to ask if certain capital exetditre already decided upon could be postponed for a time and that any extension of social services be halted until all that is involved can be contained? After all, a great deal has been done over the past few years so that a slowing down should not be condemned out .of hand. It is all very well to have bor- rowing powers butloans have to be redeemed and interest has to be paid.- Becoming' overloaded with debt will demand a reckoning one day which.may not be very palat- able. You have only got to look at affairs in the U.K. to-day' to see what can happen. A further thought-if it becomes necessary to combat low. prices for sugar, could not- aid be given in the form of a subsidy on the sugar which has to be sold at World price? Would this be unreasonable or a one-product' Island, such as Mauritius? With all these difficulties; which are so obvious, the prospects of economic Independence as'dfstinct from political Independence,, and which, would - mean- that- the country would have to stand on its own feet and fight out its own salvation, would not' appear as satisfactory as a continuing rela- tionship with the United Kingdom who, at least, could. provide help. if need be. C low Included in the earnings of the Company to which I have referred in the beginning of this Statement as being approximately a net 10% on the Share Capital there, is of course the profit earned in respect of CEYLON. Some years ago this section of the Company's earnings was fairly considerable, but it gradually became reduced owing to the political changes and progres- sively higher peialtaxatton rFortu- nately, theres S.b w an improve- met inr the politiCal atmosphere ' followi thi chas\"g of Govern- meetin T95and'there s increasing evidence of goodwill on the part of the present Coalition Government to encourage the private sector of Industry, in contrast to the anta- gonism which was displayed by the previous Government. What is unfortunate so far as we are con- cerned is that the' profit from Ceylon's' opetations represnts for the past year just about 10% of the total profit which accrued to the Company in all its operations, and it may be that, it is a good time now to refer to this, if we are to look forward to a period of progress in Ceylon. It is common knowledge that there has been a general decline in the market value of Ceylon Teas for some time now, due to the steadily Increasing world supply. and the teas which have suffered most In Ceylon arf those which are grown at mid; elevation and those grown in the low country. In our case, no less than 40 per cent. of the tea we grow comes under those categorles, and, there. fore, theOverall profit made on tea sules suffers accordingly. It s diffi- cult to see how this situation can Sbe alteredbut, in an, endavour to increasehi emand, a Tea Propaganda Scheme, Initiated and financed by the growing and distributive trades. is under way, but results' have yet to be assessed. It does seimt rather hard that, from our Estates which are in ex. collent agriouiiliturl oondtilon- ind which ro xemmoly well run by our A rlpultural Mtnaers and Etlt Suprilntmn oeno and their tlaffh, uch a ismii reward should be shown or anil their efforts.

Appeals have been made to the private sector to contribute to the growing -of foodstuffs in order to reduje the import bill and, in this coannectlv a Public Company has bee iforned called Farms & ietail Markets Ltd., ,which has been inanced by, Plantation. Companies, commercial concerns, and indivi- duals for the growing of food grains and vegetables, and their distribution and retail marketing. Those wh' were cocerned with the tniiation of tb'hs S61hme and have brought it successfully to the stage of formation of a Public Company are to be congraatte on what may o, under enoer- etic nd capabl management, to be a valuable contribution to Cey- lon's economy. Yqur Company has subscribed to this Scheme and, in addition, is making separately a material contribution by stepping up and expanding its acivit'es in animal husbandry and the produc- tion of milk and eggs on its farm on Mahaberiatenne Estate. SNow that the Balance of Pay- ments position is slightly improv- ing in Ceylon, there are. signs of remittances to this country on account of profitk being possible, and it would be encouraging if we could expect in the future some cash contribution after having been without cash income from Ceylon for so long. Conclasion In conclusion, I expect Members will fnd little encouragement in what I have had. to say,'but I would remind Stockholders that this Company went through a bad time in te nineteen thirties rom which it completely recovered, and 1 venture to say has been a reward- ing investment for its Stockholders. The present period is very difficult and obscure but, at least, we now have reasbnable cash resources which have' beed acctmutated during the past 30 years. 'The Managers and Staff both in Mauritius and Ceylon have served the Company well throughout the year in circumstances which, at times, have been both difficult and frustrating.. I feel sure that you will wish me to express to them your. appreciation of their efforts. The report and accounts were adopted. .",

The following is an extract from the circulated statement of-the joint chairmen: The consolidated profits ittribu- table to the mesbers of your Com- pany and Gresham Trust Limited, after all charges, but before taxa- tion for the year. ended 31st March 1966 amounted to Â£264.030. This compares with a consolidated pro- , fit on the same basis for the period to 31st March 1965 of Â£211,883, which consisted of Â£3,751 for Bingham Investment Trust Limited for seven months (which if adjusted to an annual basis would have amounted to Â£61;287) and Â£176,132 attributable to Gresham Trust Limited. The profits of the Com- panies previously in the .Bingham Investment Trust Limited Group /y have increased from the annual basis of Â£61,287 to Â£67,551. whilst those of Gresham Trust Limited have increased from Â£176,132 to Â£196.479. * ghbami Iinvesutmusts Usited Bingham Investments Limited has continued its policy of selling its low yielding mvestments and gradually investing the proceeds in securities showing a higher divi- dend yield. As a result of thisi policy, it is anticipated that the,' revenue from this company during the current year will be maintained notwithstanding the fact that Some dividends from its investments which normally would have been paid in this current year were paid earlier and were received in the year under review. Gresham Trust Limited Despite the political and econo- mic uncertainties, the business of Gresham Trust Limited increased during the year and for the sixth consecutive year the net profit be- fore taxation was in excess of the previous year. The new issue mar- ket was generally quiet following \" the introduction of the 1965 Bud- get and only one Offer for Sale was sponsored, but Gresham Trust Limited acted in the placing or underwriting of a. number of.fixed interest issues, namely for Prit- chqrds Cleaners (Holdings) Limited, Bristol Plant Hire Limited, George Nott Industries Limited, Sir George Godfrey and Partners (Holdings) Limited, Wilson Connolly (Hold- ings) Limited and Crown House Investments Limited.

The man who is the Argentine State oilfeld combine's seplor official during the present post-revolutionary period of remodelling, has announced that the Government is preparing a plan to bring private enterprise back into the Argentine oilAelds. The announcement-by Daniel A. Brunella, \"General Administrator\" of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales-has come exactly three months after the military take-over of power during the night of June 27, and nearly two months after the de facto President, Juan Carlos Ongania, said that YPF \"would seek the participation of capital from private firms. .. preferably national, hkt alan fnrrin \" The former President, Dr. Illia in his first post coup d'etat Pre interview two weeks ago predictet that one of the first steps the nexi constitutional Government will take will be the cancellation of any contracts the present Governmeni (which Illia said would be short. lived) might sign with any of th- many foreign oil men now in Buenos Aires. Tested Areas Brunella, speaking at a Press conference, said that the Govern. ment is preparing a call tor tenders for \"the development and exploitation of some tested areas, as well as for the exploration and subsequent exploitation in zones with antecedents sufficient for them to be considered semi-tested or pos- sibly containing hydrocarbons.\" Brunclla also said that contract. would be awarded by public te-der for \"special tasks of secondary re c~ pration\" in the oilelds here. ite General Administrator listed as important defects of YPF the lack of correct inventories and the excess of Prrsonnel, especially in administra- tive posts in Buenos Aires. Already he has dismissed many employees, hbe said, including all those hired in the last three years. He promised that YPF will initiate only projects which are indispensable and whose return will be immediate projects such as the remodelling of distilleries, an oil wharf on the Atlantic coast, and improvements in storage and distribution plants.. YPF will resort to private capital for some of these projects, he said. B;runella also announced that the otcial committee, whose. job it is to reach agreements with companies whose contracts Illia annulled, will meet for the first time to-day. Only three companies have not accepted out of court settlements. They are Cities Service, Pan American (Stan. dard. Oil of New Jersey). and the local CADIPSA.",

Ani ed in IR num ' . THE ROYALISTS are preparing to resume the war against Egyptian and Republican forces in Yemen. Reliable Royalist sources have said that hostilities will break out not later than mid-November. The Royalists are now con- vinced that President Nasser has no intentioni of withdrawing his troops and intends to use them for take-over of South Arabia when the British leave Aden in 1968. It has also been disilosed that the Royalist princes who have been leading the Royalist guerrillas in the war since it started four years ago, will hold a meeting with King Feisal at the Saudi summer resort of Taif next week to hear a report on the outcome of Kuwaiti media- tion between Saudi Arabia and the UAR. No tangible results have come from this mediation. The Royalists realise they can- not hope to defeat the 50.000 Egyptian troops now in Yemen without Saudi Arabia's help, and they have expressed confidenc- that King Feisal will continue to give them assistance. Meanwhile, important changp~ are being planned within the Royalist camp. It is reliably learned that the dethroned Imam. Mohammed al Badr, who has been leading the Royalists for four yeas will remain at the Saudi city oi Medina. where he is receiving medical treatment for an undit closed kidney trouble. The Royalist Premier, 62-year-old Prince Hassan, is also ill and will be leaving soon for medical treatment abroad. Young Prince Mohammed Bui Hussein, aged 28, has been chosen to be senior commander of the Royalist BEIRUT. Sept. 28. forces and may later be proclaimed Crown Prince, which would mean he would become the Imam if the present Imam died or abdicated Prince Mohammed has In fact always commanded the main Royalist guer- rillas in the eastern Jaws district and in May, 1965, he led the most suc- cessful offensive in that area against Egyptian forces. Reports at the time said the success of this offensive was one facto; which made President Nasser -agree in August that year with King Feisal on a plan for settlement. This agreement has now been suspended. There is much concern here in Beirut at developments in Yemen and fear of a shooting war .between the Egyptian forces in Yemen and Saudi Arabia if the Royalists resume hostili- ties. President Nasser earlier this year threatened to attack the Saudi towns of Gizan and Najran. on the Yemeni border, charging that they are a source of supplies for the Royalists."

Donges: to-day when piloting a Pierliamen' tarv Bill' fwhich,r Il mnke it., obligatory for oyd s to keep 'its deposits in South Africa equal to 70 per cent. of local premiums. This will apply to all business written after June 30 this year. Moreover, all Lloyd's agents will have to lodge deposits of between R10,000 and R20,000, amoudting to a total of R500000 from all agents, with the South African Treasury. Dr. Donges cited the recent Rhodesian experience and the need to bring Lloyd's on a par with South African-registered insurers as justification for bringing the measure before Parliament. There had been a time, during the country's insurance market growth, when it had been unquestionably more ^essential to have an addi- tional outlet such as Lloyd's for some of the country's insurance risks than now applied To-day, he said, the domestic insur. anc industry was strong enough to retain a much larger slice of local buiness. \"But our market, even assuming that it develops to the utmost extent, will never be in a position to retain all our insuranop risks for its own account. Thus Lloyd's presence In the South African market serves a useful purpose In regard to insurance, and the placing of special risks,\" he went on.

The ratio of 70 per cent. of net iremiums had been calculated by ]overnment actuary to place Lloyd's m a par with registered short.tcrm nsurers in respect of the assets the stter were required to maintain to over unexpired risks, outstanding laims and the solvency margin of 0 per cent, of the previous year's remlums Deposits and assets would be held ner the control of a representative hich the committee of Lloyd's would Sr red to appoint In the Repub. c, anrssets would have to be main. sined In such a way that at least 50 er cent, of the totl deposits and ssets were with banking nstitutions nd giltodedd securities, such as overnment stock, he stated.",

Kwon. 4d in ! , was Mr. K, D fll from the legislat d Presdent Park C Nqlig seq o rer0edhe Cabinet back to office. usi thb basth isue in the ttrrent trouble, the smugling scandal in. volving Â£42.000 Worth of raw saccharin.ibrought in from Japan by officials of Korea's largest busi. ness combine, Samsung, last May, has yet to be settled. The Opposition is pressing for the Cabinet to be thrown out. It accuses it of being responsible for the smuggling, and is trying to stir up popular distrust of Mr. Park's regime. Its aim is to rally people's support behind it for next year's national elections. Although no specific dates have been set yet, the Presidential vote is expected in May and National Assembly elec. tions in June. Recurrent Scandals There seems little doubt that Mr. Park, a former Army general who seized power in the 1961 coup d'etat and squeezed into Presidency with 43 per cent of popular vote in t963, will be re-elected. With credit for the country's economic progress and reputation for per- sonal integrity unblemished by the recurrent scandals around him, the President would have no trouble against an opposition still almost as badly split as three years ago. The groups opposing Mr; Park are attempting to merge their forces and present a single unified candidate in the Presidential race, but so far with scant success. No effective challenger is in sight, and the 'foiner President Posun Yun, leader of the splinter New Korea Party who lost to Mr. Park in 1963 by a narrow margin, has alienated most of his popular fol- lowing through his- intransigent stand opposing just about every. thing. Another possible. Mrs. Pak Soon Chun. chief of the major opposition Minjung (Masses) Party, is not thinking of making a bid, while the Party's other logical candidate, ex-Premier Huh Chung. has indicated he will hot run un- less the entire opposition unites behind him. As for the parliamentary elec- tions, the present indications are that Mr. Park's Democratic Re' publican Party-which holds 110 seats against Minjunl's 59 in the 175-member uni-cameral National President Park Assembly-will be able at least to maintain its present strength. The Party's founder and chairman, Mr. Kim Chong Pil, who engineered the 1961 coup when he was a lieutenant - colonel, has been steadily' strengthening the Party organisation and promoting its popular appeal under the slogan of \" Modernisation of the Father- land.\" Little ideological difference exists among these parties. They are all anti-Communist and pro- American. Socialists released from prison a few months ago are in the process of forming their own party, but they are also split, their number is small, and their influence in this staunchly anti- Communist nation negligible. So the election campaigns are expected to centre on economic issues. President Park and his Party will campaign on the strength of the Government's success in achiev- ing a high rate of economic growth (8 per cent last year), boosting exports from $33m. in 1960 to S180m. in 1965, slowing down the pace of inflation which once went out of control, and rapidly indus- trialising this predominantly agri- cultural nation. The Government, completing this year its first five-year economlc development programme, is ready to implement a second plan that empbasises self-help and aims at a large degree of self-reliance by 1971with a goal of a 7 per cent annual rise in GNP. It Is also credited with having, raised South Korea's international status, especi- ally in Asia. A year ago it pushed through the treaty restoring normal diplomatic relations with Japan, the still-distrusted neighbour that had occupied Korea for 40 years until 1945. Soon after, it dispatched military forces to fight Communism in Vietnam. It was chiefly on Korea's initiative that Foreln Ministers of ten countries met in Seoul last June to form the Asian- Pacific Council for regional co. operation and only this week Korea has agreed to go to President Johnson's Manila conference on Vietnam. In Korean eyes, all these created greater international prestige. Resentment There is of course the dark side of the situation, which the Opposi- tion is taking advantage of in its attempt to discredit 4he Govern- ment. The basic problem is that South Korea is still a poor country with too many people (28m.) and not enough work. Last year the average per capita income was only about S101, and even the projected rise by one-third in the next five years will make it only $134. The housing shortage is acute. living conditions in farm villages are primitive, and many salaried workers live on bare subsistence incomes. Unemployment remains high. at 13 per cent. Then the frequent scandals and widespread graft also handicap the Government. A strong undercurrent of frustration and resentment still remains among the students. who in 1960 toppled the Government' of the late Dr. Syngman Rhee and staged massive anti-Government demonstrationis in all subsequent years until last year. On balance, the desire for stability seems stronger than resentment against the Government. although an unexpected incident can always create a new crisis-as happned last week. 11 II . Ir",

The significant fact about the festival is that the Monopol stores (which are restricted by law to clothes and cosmetics) had not. -bought a single' article from -teat Oitain, for-nearly 20 years.;:AA a result. f the festival, and -on a strictly comiercial non -susidised basis, they have got all the Luiem- bourg teenagers into. tartan skirts and their elder sisterslnto drain- 0ipe wool slacks in check patterns, and Shetland sweaters. Many Luxembourg noses are being wiped with British print handkerchiefs, while many Luxembourg bath- rooms are aromatised with British bath salts.

Ouicklv 'staged ONB OP the most succafulimall- itta\"eBtitish promotions yet staged aded here last Saturday. The fort- Quicklystaged The venture was staged very quickly. The proposal was first made in March. and it was in April that the chairman's daughter. Mile. Marie-Antoinette Scholer, made if there had been more planning time. The fact that the worsted suitings did not sell was due rather to the lack of made-to-measure promotion than to anythiop to do with the cloth itself. The big stock of men's sweaters and cardigans hung fire. but probably because an unexpecd sapell of fine hot weather une4xpected spell of fine hot weather ladies' underwear was bidly over priced, with the solitary exception or the stretch-nylon lines which found a quick market., Thesurprise of the festival was the competitive prices at which many of the goods were offered, In tis. the ,pronmt _tdiffred.mark- **dly.from a:iqitlar 'Ooni .l4rger scale sponsored .1t.

The -ullovers were a special success. uecause the quality was so good that the cheaper lines quickly led prospective buyers to examine the miire highly priced, and nearly eveiy sale was a full grade higher thair was envisaged at the, first approach. . Direct Supply' The cheap prices - wre, made poskible by direct supply So many of the Luxembourg shops ar- supplied through Belgian sources that shoppers are used to the effect of the high Belgian handling charges and the successive impacts of the purchase tax. This applie specially to British goods; and Luxembourg buyers, often comr plain that they are,, freat~d; a cotintry couisins by. 04giah.tiwpourt agents. their urgent orders dlayed, their supplies kept waiting, in. Bfussels warehouses and the final prices out of court. In this ,oase, most of this trouble was elimiinated. There were commissions to pay in the U.K., of course; hut the mark- up, from the ex-mill price in Britain to the store shelves of the organisation, was not much over 30 per cent. The Export Council for Europe ;ad. of course, provided a large number of Union Jacks and other display material: two pipers stationed at Folkestone had come over for the occasion; and further dignity was added by two stalwart. and very tall. uniformed members of the Eastbourne County Con- stabulary. It was, however, un- fortunate on the gastronomic side that there was no time to get .effective support from the Cheese Board: for Jack Feldman, loaned from his job at the Strand Corner ( House to intrigue the Luxem- bourg palate, had to work with local materials and could find only Cheshire. in cellophane-wrapped portions which for lack of British water biscuitj. e had to serve with a Germin \"version of the cream cracker. The festival, of course, was part of the preparatory experience for the more-' ambitiouÃ½ and much ,more hevtily sponsored, British Week to be held in Brussels a'year hence. It has established four things. First, there are many.lines of British goods which, if they are brouaht to Europe with due care as to the cost of their distribution channels, can leap the barrier of . discriminatory Common Market duties. Secondly, there is no.heed to be bashful about British food for, in good hands, it is a winner anywhere and promotes the right commercial atmosphere. The third point is the importance of packag- itn and presetation-for it was this which earned such golden opinions for British bath salts and cosmetics. The final point is the , importance of colour. Whether it be the good British dyewarqs or the good British techniques in using them, it was nearly always the colour which proved the sales .point, the shop assistants said.",

Extra cost of a London ffice and all W 'asted profit I And still you hang on I And nowS ET may well be costing you over Â£1 a head a week. We've told you how to save that sixfold,. saving over Â£1 a head a day. Or how you would probably offset the whole tax by moving out no more than 1/6th of your staff. And still you're not tempted ? We've shown how much easier it is to get good staff Soutside-staff that stay with the job and enjoy And we've backed it all up with case histories successful moves... You certainly are hard to persuade I The case for moving out of London now is stronger than ever. Some businessmen may feel tempted to adopt a \"wait and see\"attitude. But expansion can- not wait. Renewal of leases cannot wait. Cost cutting cannot wait.

Up to a few days ago the one hopeful sign was that BMC was phasing its redundancies over a five-week period in order to collaborate closely with special teams of employ- ment officers being organised by the Ministry of Labour. About 100 officers are to be brought in from as far afield as Derbyshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. It is intended to Ist up special interviewing facilities within BMC's sac. ::: tories, and so meo the pro- Scessi o( \" edeloryment \" as painless And emcient as pos- sible. The first Ministry of Labour team is due in BMC Longbridge next Friday, but now it looks as if these plans will have to be scratched. The oficial strike by 740 drivers employed b the Longbridg Group of eivery Agents over the redun- dancy notices which have dy gone out to 360 of tems ha brOtght Longbridge o a virtual hlt and already cused 13,000 layoffs within the BMC group. These figures will increase rapidly as the strike continues. Digging In All the indications are that the employers and the Trans. port' ad Generl Workers' Union are digin in for a long drawn *o battle. The LGDA .s convinced that BMC's cutback in production will be much more serious and protracted than Union officials yet know. Under the circum- stances they are not prepared to carry a substantially over- weight labour force month after month. For its part the TGWU believes it has found the perfect form of protest strike against redundsuanei throughout BMC. The delivery men have been traditionally even more militant than assembly workers-and their 100 per cent. response to the strike call has hit BMC as hard as a mass walk-out of assembly workers. The cost to the union is relatively small in financial terms. However, the cost in terms of damage to such \"redeploy- ment plans as exist could be much more serious. Already there are indications that com- ponent manufacturers will be laying men off on a large scale if the dispute continues. Once gone, it is unlikely that all of them will be called back, only to be declared redundant again in a few weeks' time. As a result the Ministry of Labour will find itself faced with a far tougher problem when it comes to interviewing these men and attempting to find relevapt work for their skills.",

With the aid of Ogilvy and Mather advertis- ing experts the Tea Council is setting dut to change this.

Dortant, It .was nrst. necessary to carry out a great deal of research within the industry so that basic costs could be established accurately. In a paper on indemnity, Mr. W. G. Watson discussed fire insur- ance. It should be possible, he sug- gested, to draw up a wording for consequential loss policies which would cover the loss of profit and wages sustained within the period of indemnity 'up to the lmit 'of the sum insured, subject to average. ,That might be' welcomed by thy insuWt 'phblic aitf wtoilld be more flexible than existing systems.- In cargo insurance, Mr. E. D. Rainbow stated that unless there were fluctuationsin value between the time of shipment and the time when a claim arose, a settlement based on the prime cost of the goods, plus the costs of insurance and freight would preserve the principle of indemnity as the owner would have lost not only the goods but the money he paid to ship and insure them and the profit he would have made on sale. He pointed-oo that in hull insur. ance the owner's asseisment of the value of a vessel was normally accepted for Insurance but under writers, he warned, had to be on their guard against Inflated values.

GODON TETHER ms to 000 nthat 120-isis itabl w hlithe do- ieivÃ½ 1 t\"0'inter- i i,'.liq t onict ,s by afl tfiOAnwicans hiavd manufatturted'ifo bombard- * the Prefch lu tbire he *tS!,,more y deelsy i vtd i an exmiese that is calculAted to put Btrtn in -th bad with the o er Coni on Market countries as well a* with France herself, he would do well to examine a good deal more carefully the background to 1he Franco-American tussle. For, if he did. he would discover that France's attitude towards the deficit settlement issue is by no means as unreasonable as it is customary to paint it and that the best hope of ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the war lies in switch- ing the contest to a somewhat diferent battleground. Into the Open Up to quite recently, the Labour Government manifested a great reluctance to make more than the faintest of noises about the inter- national liquidity controversy-this despite the fact that no country was more deeply concerned in the matter than the U.K. and accord- antly had a greater right to have a big say. Presumably. it took the view that the best thing a country so dependent on the goodwill of others to keep itself financially afloat could do in the circum- stances was to keep its, mouth shut. However, the favourable Con. tinental reaction to its latest special measures programme having pre- sumably generated a feeling of greater confidence, it has recently been coming more into the open. And one of the ways in which it has been doing so is by closely identifying itself with the Americans in their protracted argument with the French on the question of how international pay- ments deficits should be settled. I say \" identifying themselves.\" But in truth the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his increasingly frequent allusions to the progress of the Franco-American battle has surpassed Washington in endeavouring to bring home to the French the alleged enormity of their crime. Thus, having earlier this month trounced \"those who would like to see the destruction of the reserve currency system,\" he went on to declare during a joint television interview with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury last Sunday that the idea sponsored by the French of reverting to gold settlements was one of \"primitive barbarity.\" These are hard words. Yet the fact of the matter is that this \"primitive barbarity\" was being rigorously enforced by the Americans in their dealings with the rest of the world up to only a few years ago. It is also the case that it is enshrined in the present Articles of A` rmet of the International Monet PFund, no one having thopghbUt taropriate so far to press for its banishment. IMF rules on the settlepent of international payments diffrences -rules which the U.S., played a Sbiggdr part in shaping tad ady other country-entitle every mein- ber acquiring other members' cur. rencies to ask the countries con- cerned to convert them into gbld if it so wishes. And no couhtry was more enthusiastic about seeifn this rule enforced than the U.S. until it began to run into chronic payments difficulties itself around the end of the 1950s and Washing. ton found it convenient to start changing its tune. Indeed, up to the beginning of the 1960s, it was American policy not to stockpile a single dollar's worth of the cur- rencies of other countries-not even when they were experiencing acute external payments difficulties and a temporary suspensiod 6f the. convertibility principle would have been most helpful tothem. . U.S. Convenience. In advocating a return to gold settlements for payments differen- ces, therefore, France is doing no more than contending that inter- national settlement mechanisms prescribed by the IMF and heavily endorsed in the not-so-distant past by the Americans themselves should not be allowed to fall into. disuse just because it now happens to suit the convenience of the U.S. to keep them in suspense. French objections to the so-called gold ex- change standard system-which provides for the use of reserve cur- rencies alongside gold for settling deficits-stem not so much from the feeling that it cannot serve a useful purpose. Rather are they rooted in the contention that'the system is being perverted-as M. Debr6, the French Minister, put it in his address to the IMF meeting this week-to serve 'the selfish interests of the U.S. It can, of course, be argued that two wrongs do not make a right, especially if they are separated in time-that the fact that the Ameri- cans considered they were justified in insisting in the 1950s on the full operation of the convertibility rules laid down in the IMF charter does not prove that the French are right in doing the same in the 1960s, the era of international financial col- laboration. But it has to be recog- nised that the U.S. payments situation has suffered a major turn. about since the 1950s that has had the effect of giving Washington a vested interest in the informal sus- pension of currency convertibility. So, to press the \"two wrongs do not make a right\" argument suc- cessfully against the French, it would be necessary to show that America is not benefiting to a materially greater extent than the general run of other countries from the introduction of the new principle. And that, I hardly peed say, is far from easy. I It is true that the payments deficit that the U.S. is being grqatly I helped to contain by the infofmal a suspension of the convertibility of i the dollar springs to a substaptial Sextent from heavy U.S. spending Sabroad on two international good causes-the preservation of the peace and the promotion of the J economic development of the Sdnder-privileged countries of the a world. But it is also accounted for Sin 'significant degree by activity c that it is much less easy to portray Jt h being motivated by unselfish . considerations-notably the out- 1 fdlo of U S. capital into investment 3 activity ii the advanced countries s of the world. e It is sometimes argued that the - econonmi prggress of other ad- it vanced countries would suffer g greatly if the fl w of U.S. capital s to them w . c off.

   "text_content" : "FOR THE FIRST time since UDI, a British Minister has been to Salisbury for serious talks With Mr. lan Smith. It was there- fore permissible to hope that there might be.some chance of a negotiated settlement. But Mr. Bowden, the Commonwealth Secretary, confessed on his de- parture from Rhodesia yesterday that he was not optimistic. The lines of communication are still open, but the two sides are so far apart that it is hard to see them bridging the gap within the two months or so before the Bri- tish ultimatum expires. Too liberal by half There can be no doubt that the British Government, in its final effort, was prepared to go at least as far to meet Mr. Smith as in the touch-and-go negotia- tions immediately before UDI. Although the African Common- wealth may have been given the impression that Mr. Smith was merely being asked to negotiate a return to constitutional govern- ment, Mr. Bowden has clearly been discussing with him the constitution under which a new, legal government-with Mr. Smith still Prime Minister- would be granted independence. But even terms that might be denounced by the Africans as a \"sell-out,\" though they might appear the best obtainable to British public opinion, are still being rejected by Mr. Smith as too liberal by half for his Rho- desian Front supporters. White Rhodesians have formed a habit of ditching Prime Minis- ters who show any sign of soft- ness towards the Africans; Mi. Smith has no doubt been fortified in his resistance to British blan. dishments by the example of his predecessor, Mr. Winston Field. He must also know that the con- sequences of failure to agree do iot seem so very dire in Salis bury, in spite of the Common wealth Conference's threat of selective mandatory sanctions by the United Nations Security Council. Sanctions up to now have manifestly failed to produce even the economic distress ex- pected, let hlone the political change of heart that might or might not have followed after a further time-lag. There is no prospect that the sort of manda tory sanctions contemplated by Britain would have any greater effect. e The British Government is a anxious to avoid mandatory oil s sanctions, because of the risk of - a clash with South Africa, which t could have repercussions on ster. f ling. When it has finally ex- . hausted all the possibilities of a i negotiated settlement-and Mr. SSmith may find it in his interests y to help it play for time for the e next two months-it is likely to 1 propose to the Security Council Ssome action on Rhodesian ex- f ports of tobacco and minerals Ssuch as can have only a marginal Seffect on Mr. Smith's payments position, as long as South Africa remains as an open back door. When the Commonwealth sees Show modest the secret weapon of its Conference looks at the final unveiling, its African mem- Sbers are likely to be bitterly dis- appointed, particularly Zambia. Rhodesia's exports to Zambia are still a major loophole in sanctions; but Zambia will not decide on the Â£14m. British aid Soffer to enable her to develop alternative supply routes until she has decided whether or not to break with Britain; and this in turn she will not decide until Sshe sees what sort of sanctions Britain will propose to the UN. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the Anglo-Zambian dispute, it is certainly making sanctions even less effective than they Smight be. SUpto o the Africans Britain has the meagre conso- Slation that, if she does not get Commonwealth support in the United Nations-especially from Nigeria and Uganda, who are on the Security Council-her ulti- matum will remain open-ended, and she will still be free to negotiate a settlement with Mr. Smith. But the ineffectiveness of UN action on sanctions is likely to make the White Rhodesians less disposed than ever to make concessions. The Rhodesian crisis will be with us for a long Stime to come. The solution may v ultimately lie not with Britain- e which has never exercised effec- Stive power in Rhodesia-but with I the Rhodesian Africans them. r selves. Independent or depen- a dent, legal or illegal, the Rho. ) desian Whites will ultimately have to do a deal, not with Mr. SWilson and Mr. Bowden, but r with Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Sithole.",

   "text_content" : "BY JOE ROGALY F THE Ministry of Tech- nology is considered as primarily a machine for talk- ing us all into technological progress, then it is fortunate indeed in its new Minister. Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn, who took over on July 4, the day following Mr. Frank Cousins's resignation, talks extremely well. \"I've been told that I ought to raise the status of engineers,\" he said in his Millbank Tower office yesterday. \"But I think that's isulting to the engineers -as if I could lift them up by their ears, like President Johnson with his beagles.\" New Ideas Mr. Wedgwood Benn is full of new ideas, and vivid ways of expressing them. He will need to be. His Ministry, in which Mr. Cousins did a certain amount of solid work behind his thick- fingered public image, is about to go through yet another meta- morphosis. The last major one was when Mr. Wilson gave it responsibility for the mechanical and .electrical engineering in- dustries as a whole. There was another change on the Friday before Mr. Benn's first Monday in office. The founding Perma- nent Secretary, Sir Maurice Dean, retired prematurely and was replaced by a Treasury man, Sir Richard Clarke (who came via the Ministry of Aviation). The Controller (and top scientist in the Ministry), Dr. J. B. Adams, is leaving and a new one will have to be found. More far-reaching than all of this will be the acquisition some .time thij autqmn of responsl- bility for shipbuilding (it will .come, plus staff, from the Board of Trade) and as yet unspmeifed parts of the defunct Ministry of Aviation. Just what will come from Aviation is not yet being said in detail. The Board of Trade will oversee the civilian air cor- porations, and the airframe and aircraft manufacturing industry will be mainly Technology's responsibility. But there is some tussle with the Ministry of Defence over-among other things-procurement and the disposal of the major research organisations; the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Royal Radar Establishment (promised by Mr. Wilson to Technology), which between them employ some 11,080 people, It is con- ceivable that the Post Office Research department might also be acquired. Since the present staff of the Ministry of Technology is under 6,000 and the total staff that could come to it from aviation and shipbuilding alone may pos- sibly come to three times that total, the question before the Minister is likely to be, who shall swallow and who shall be swallowed 7 Aviation is sending Sir Ronald Melville who was at Defence as Second Permanent Secretary to Sir Richard Clarke. Mr. Benn, when I visited him yesterday, seemed untroubled by the prospect of all this sudden growth. \" What we are develop- ing into,\" he said, \" i a Ministry of4Industry.\" HIeo the work thathas to be done atSnore pracl ticta than the weoo 0techflo. IQ \" might imply t What we want is a Ipatnethip-and in- dustry is beginning to see the advantas of such a department as o urs. . ,. .+ SM; Benn, Who was born on the site of the Millbank Tower (Mrs. Beatrice Webb lived next. door) has such a neat exposition to offer on what he:sees as the +'hape of things to come that it woulitbe a pity not to reproduce it. It tirna out that for roughly a century folloing 1850 Britain was not advancing very much on the technological front but dis- sipating its energies in the pur- suit of Empire. Present Role \"So we had public schools to train District Commissioners and men aspiring to become Vice- roys,\" Mr. Benn explained. \"Now we have comprehensive schools, no Empire, and a recog- nition that in answer to Dean Acheson, Britain's new role is industrial excellence.\" This new order, it so happens, was symbolised on Tuesday when Lancaster House was the scene of a Productivity Conference instead of a colonial constitu- tional conference, Mr. Benn added as a reminder. \"The objective status of scientists and engineers must be made plain, for it is they who create the environment for industrial ex. cellence.\" SThis, it appears, is where the expanding Minitry of Techno logy comes in. oWe are engaged in a massive programme of-- won't say lropagaida-public education. When we moved out of empire into technology we moved out of India into Blue Streak, which was ersatz prestige technology. That was wrong. Now we are being more prac- tical.\" As I have reported, Mr. Benn's ability to talk is not in doubt; neither, to-be far, is the necessity for talM if the purposes of the Ministry are to b met The abilityto put things across, plu the growth of the; Ministry, should give it pretiAge and cor- responding influece; what it still lacks is statutory power and, to some extent, money. A number of useful advances have been made in the past yeas in spite of the Ministry's slender resources of cash and direcl power. But the real power- that which might come from controlling the Â£6,000m. spent on public procurements every yeaw -is still lacking. Nor can Mr. Benn force the Government to set an example of technological advance in its own departments -any blitz through the Civil Service would, of course, have to be fired off by the Treasury. Spending at the Ministry of Technology is increasing. The Civil Estimates put the budget for the current financial year at Â£24.4m. as opposed to Â£13.2m. last year. Some Â£7.4m. of the Â£11.2m increase is due to the Ministry's takeover from the Anthony Wedgwood Benn Treasury of responsibility for advances to the National Re- search Development Corpora- tion; even so, staff and other costs of the Ministry are up. When aviation, and shipbuilding are tacked on, the budget will naturally be expanded out of all proportion to its present iize. This may not mean any addi- tional cost to the Exchequer but will, to the Ministry of Techno- logy, be a welcome addition of the power that comes from a deeper purse. Other Activities Nevertheless, the Ministry's ability to usher us into the new technological empire will still be limited by the fact that its spending will (by national stan- dards) be small, while its other activities will be confined largely to the admittedly useful dissemi- nation of information. The Minister would disagree. He thinks it right that the administrators responsible for fosterinp industries should be separated from those responsible to or for the customers (he admits that he saw things in a different light as a customer at the Post Office than be does now) and maintains that the circumscribed purchasing power of his own Ministry is deliberate. To him it seems that more can be done than simply publishing technological information, al. though this is an important part of the Ministry's work. \"We have been looking, for example, at price increases affecting the industries for which we are re- sponsible,\" he told me. Most encouragingly Mr. Benn sees his Ministry as concerned with management. \" Manage- ment is a technology,\" he says, and it is in the development of good management in every field that he sees one of the best hopes of advance. This, plus the use of influence (as opposed to control) over public procurements is one of the lines of thought that Mr. Benn seems well prepared to ,* follow through. On procure- ment, he sees the possibility of industry modifying its own con- tractors' practices \"as Marks and Spencer does with its sup- pliers\" and, in all the Ministry's work (including management study) he looks to the time when the Ministry will be working with new public corporations such as the hived off Post Office and the Industrial Reorganisa- tion Corporation. \"We are be. coming an important economic department-it is a matter of growth,\" he says. Basic Objective \"Our basic objective is to advance technology; we can be selective between good and bad firms, and openly commercial.\" Does that mean. I asked him, that the purpose of the Ministry is to maximise the profits of British industry? Mr. Benn, just off to the Labour Party con- ference, gave a suppressed smile. \"We want the most successful possible British industry,\" he Side.stepped, \"and profit is of course a criterion of success. But the question of how you divide the profits once made is another subject. . . \" Mr. Benn, the good talker, is fortunate enough to know when not to talk.",

   "text_content" : "Transfers Abroad Sir,--The announcement in your &sue of Thursday last that one of he leading British insurance goups will on January 1 next ansfer the whole of its South .frican business to a local sub- diary raises a question of ethics i relation to its shareholders. A ransfer to a wholly-owned sub- idiary, a common transition from branch organisation, could bene- i the shareholders of the parent ompany through the added impetus of a local company; it i, however, quite a different tory when it is proposed to issue ew shares to the public in South Africa, which will reduce the mnount of the benefit hitherto inoyed by the shareholders of the parent company. South Africa s one of the few remaining ter- itories in which insurance com- panies can still earn profits and the new shareholders-participat- ig only in the results of the local business-will be In an incom. parably better position than the oid ones, who will qontinue to uffer from the losses on the ominant unprofitable business drived from other areas. Even allowing for prudent con- ideration of possible exchange or lgislative problems, it is dificult o believe that the directors could ujstify the alienation of profits rom existing shareholders without he agreement of the latter. ertainly they are without moral ight in so doing. As a shareholder iyself, albeit a very small one, he first intimation I have received s through your columns and I ave searched vainly through the ast statement of the chairman for any hint of this intention. The roup in question has already urned a profit recovery in 1964 Ito a substantial underwriting loss or 196Y as a result of a further merger which was not welcomed by all of us: It has all its work ot out to persuade the market hat its shares are worth more than 65 per cent of the quoted equiva. lent for the first conversion date r in two years of loan stock issued f to achieve that merger. I suggest e that the latest proposal will do t nothing to help that process. RONALD BEALB. 27, Oatlands Close, Weybridge. S Surrey. Too Few ?.. it Sir,-In his interesting article d about civil servants (September 16), it Christopher Tugendhat tells us that it we have too few of them. e Other people tell us that we have b too few doctors, too few dentists, e too few scientists, too few o engineers, too few university e teachers, too few schoolteachers, a too few policemen, too few econo- r mists, too few accountants, too - few valuers, too few secretaries, too d few skilled workers, too few sol. t- diers, too few . ... l Wait! Maybe we are just too it few, full stop. But no. On second e thoughts that cannot be right. For o if there were more of us, we e should need even more civil ser- is vants, doctors, etc.. etc. So we should still be too few... ; and so i. on ad Infinitum. No solution lies ir that way. It And, seriously, there is no solu- d tion to the problems of the civil t service along the lines Christopher it Tugendhat discusses. Fundamen- r. tally these are not problems of re- si cruitment; fundamentally they are ir not, pace the Pulton Committee, D, problems of personnel management d at all. The fundamental problem I is how to run the Government e more efficiently and productively. ir The solution must be sought in a the approach which modern man- y agement brings to industry and 4 commerce: analysing objectives; is re-designing the organisation to ir achieve the objectives: introducing d new techniques (for processing In. k formatiqn and taking decisions. In it this cas); re-training In these n new techniques; de-skilling work hitherto regarded as skilled; and re-deploying men to new work from work now rendered unnecessary by changes in objectives or changes in techniques. As in a firm, the first need is for top managers (which in this case means Ministers, of whatever party) with the capacity to apply this approach successfully. Perhaps we have . . . too few. J. H. ROBERTSON. 21, Phillimore Place. W.8. .. Overstaffea Sir,-I could not help being mildly amused by your article on shortage of staff in the civil service. Two years ago I left the civil ser- vice after a three year spell as a legal assistant in one of the major departments of state. For the first two and a half years of that time I estimate that I did, on average, about one day's work in three. This was simply due to gross over. staffing in the section in which I was employed. I cannot speak for the rest of the civil service with any first hand knowledge, but what I did see cer- tainly did not suggest that my situ. ation was in any way unusual. P. S. ATIYAH. New College, Oxford. Cost of Wrapping Sir.-In the Issue of September 23 (Page 8). Mr. C. J. Creech's claim that wrapping added 30s to the average housewife's weekly food bill, received wide coverage in the national Press. Either Mr. Creech was incorrectly briefed before he addressed the Conference of the Public Health Inspectors' Assoca- tion or he has been Incorrectly reported. In either case this Is unfortunate at this particular time. as it suggests there Is an area of great waste here. where consider. able isvlngs could be made. In the highly competitive food market no manufacturer can afford to use unnecessary packaging, ex- I cept possibly for a limited range Sos seasonal de luxe items; his Scriterion is that his goods must Sreach the customer in optimum condition. In the case quoted of r biscuits they must be fresh and Sunbroken. Much of the cost of Sthis form of packaging is offset i by the fact that the goods can be Sserved more quickly or sold by self-service-thus avoiding heavy labour overheads. In 1964 the total value of the packaging market was Â£670m. This, divided between 17%m. households Sworks out at 16s 6d per household. Furthermore. it does not relate to food alone, but includes all forms of transit packaging and unit I containers. r The best estimate I can get is tthat food packaging accounts for Sbetween 2s 6d and 3s per house- hold per week.

Export Consultancy Sir,-As partners in a small export consultancy business, we were delighted to read your article on 23rd September giving promi. nence to the specialised service which is available to companies wishing to export. These companies need not be put r off by the word \"consultancy as in many cases, such as our own, payment Is based on results and in the strict sense is not a consultancy * fee, SThe service is available to small Scompanies who do not necessarily Swish to use the wider facilities mentioned In your article, and in v effect places a complete export s department at their disposal.

Mr. Harry Nicholas, assistant general secretary of the TGWU annoyed at getting information either from the Press or fron meetinas between BMC and shoo stewards. comolained at the iadl imeutings between BMC and saho â¢ of consultation at national level He further complained that, as far as the TGWU was concerned BMC \"was getting back to the jungle of the post-war era\" where there were eight months of. pro duction and four months of tui employment. \"The possibilitie of redeployment of redundan workeri i the motor-car industr do not exist\" he said. \"So fa as we know nobody is asking so this sort of labour. Lucas Decision Other developments yesterday gave further cause for concern Joseph Lucas announced that it is to lay off 10,000 workers to-nigh until Tuesday because of the delivery drivers' strike, which has shut down assembly lines at BMC And it became known that 1,300 out of a total working force o 9,200 at Morris Motors, Cowley. â¢ would be dismissed. TOWU leaders raised the de livery strike question while at the Minstry, but to far there ha: been no move to try and get the two sides together for talks. Al the indications are that the strike will be a lengthy one, making the situation even more confused. The Ministry has plans to se- up employment offices within BMC before November 4, when the redundancies Will start to take effect, but if the strike continues there will be no workers there. Mr. Gunter, having listened yesterday to the arguments cf the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Engi- neering Union, and the Transport and General Workers' Union, promised to consider their com- plaints of lack of consultation and an \" over-zealous\" redundancy policy by BMC. All. delegates pleaded for more work sharing. The next logical approach for the Minister would presumably be to consult with BMC, but the official statement after the meeting limited itself to 'saying that the Minister would be i touch with the unions after he had considered their views. \"On the question of avail- able opportunities -he Minister pointed out that the latest figures showed in the West Midlands Area 15,334 vacancies for men and 8,926 for women.\" When asked about this figure after the meeting Mr. Nicholas pointed out that there were about the same number of unemployed in the West Midlands and there was great concern about finding suitable obs for car workers within the TGWU.",

JAMES CALLAGHAN, Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking to the Press Club here to-day, noted a general concern lest the current period of restraint in Britain would discourne industrial modernliatlon and impair the U.K.'s relative efficiency. He said the idea that Britain was facing a period of total inertia \" is abso. lutely contrary to the facts\" and denied that the process of modern. isation will come to a halt, The Chancellor laid a great deal of emphasis on the redeployment of labour, Asked whether unem. ployment would now be moving up to the half-million mark, he replied that a higher rate of unemployment than in the east could be made tolerable if It were spread more evenly over the country, or it it were short-term. This willngness to accept a higher rate of unem- ployment than n the past appeared to strike home to his American hearers, Mr. Callaghan made a brilliant personal success and his quickness and relaxed confidence were received with surprised admiration and probably did moce to promote a more optimistic mood than any. thing he actually said,"

Mr. Herbert Bowden, Commonwealth Secretary, told a Press conference, at mid day to-day, before leaving Salisbury for London, that he was \"not optimistic\" about a ettler e t of the Rho(desi dispute. I :he talks were not over in tLe sense that the door remained open, he said, but no firm plans had been made for another meet- ing with Mr. Smith. Time was running out, but there was still time for reflection and wise decisions. Time is not on our side, \"and if progress is to be made within the timetable to which we now have to work it will be dependent on willingness by those in Rho- desia to accept the principles which we have clearly and consistently stated, and to create effective machi- nery for their implementation.\" Mr. Bowden warned. It was clear from his remarks that the talks have foundered on the same issues over which discus- sions between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith broke down some 11 months ago. In fact, the tone and content of to-day's Bowden statement was very similar to that made by Mr. Wilson himself when he left Rho- desia just prior to UDI. Differences clarified Some progress was made at the five meetings with Mr. Smith, said the Commonwealth Secretary, in that there had been clarification of the areas of disagreement. As a result, there could no longer be any doubt about what was in each other's minds and what was re- quired for a settlement. While he declined to discuss the areas of agreement and disagree- ment, Mr. Bowden stressed the three basic conditions that had to be met. In particular, he reiterated that progress to majority rule had to be \"unimpeded and guaran. teed.\" This advance he said. Editorial Com quoting Mr. Wilson, should be measured \"by merit and achieve- ment and not by the clock or calendar. \" But it must not be arbitrarily held back.\" Any settlement must be demonstrated by a \"fair test to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.\" He men- tioned a Royal Commission as a method of testing opinion though he would. not discuss its composi- tion. Thirdly, he said that before any settlement could be formally nego- tiated and put to this test, there. had to be a return to constitutional rule by the \" establishment of a broadly based administration, in- cluding Rhodesians 'of all races.\" He reiterated that a return to con- stitutional rule would inot, and could not, mean an immediate advance to'majority rule. Mr. Bowden described these pointas . the, ess% ls of the British slion. T had been put to t people of Rhodesia. in- cluding the regime. and in this pay, he said. Sir Elwyn Jones the Attorney-General, add he himself had discharged as far as they could the task which brought them to Rhodesia.

   "text_content" : "Iy iUOUFFREY OWEN, WHY DO EXECUTIVES re. sipg from apparently successful and well-run compaaie, even when they have interesting jobs, nood slaries. and excellent prospects for promotion? Ther re a disturbingly large number of caes of compaples losing young and talented managers, often in their thirties or fort!es whom they really cannot afford to lose. This often happens. not because of an internal row or clash of personalities but because the young managers somehow feel cut off from the chain of command, unable tc influence the direction which the firm is following. There -is blockage in communications, sc that the knowledge and ideas which the young manager can contribute fail to penetrate into the decision-making process. Of course it is right that executives in their 30s and 40s should be reasonably mobile, and not committed for life to a single employer. There are dangers in too much promotion from within. The mighty General Motors has come under sharp criticism during the past year because of its ham-fisted reaction to the widespread public alarm in the U.S. over car safety. Part of the trouble. according to some critics, is that Seneral Motors, though bril liantly managed by the usual canons, is too inbred, too re mote from outside influences. and too inclined to judge all issues according to internal criteria. \"Breeding\" There is a good deal to be said, too, for the breeding pro- cess whereby executives from large and successful companies decide to set up on their own and establish separate firms in a related line of business. This is fairly common in science-based industries like electronics, but it nappens in other fields too. In machine tools, for instance, a small and progressive Leicester firm, Marwin, was set up by some engineers from a much larger Leicester company. Wadkin. What is not so healthy is when people resign for less constructive reasons, when they still have a great deal to con- tribute to their present employer. This problem of how to retain and motivate middle managers will becomn even more acute if,. as. some observers believe, there is an inexorable trend 'towards centralisation of policy-making in large companies. Some such trend appears to have been taking place'in the relationship between ' large Americln companies and their European subsidiaries, and one reult has been' a, numbes of .resignations among, mddle-t- u enior mauagers. Some of them 1 complain that decisions which Sthey would previously. have Staken on their own have to be Sreferred to the parent in the SU.S.; this not only takes tim-. \" but often leads to bad decisib6n . These complaints probably . have to be taken with a pinch Sos salt, and there are often d other considerations, such as a , dislike of frequent journeys Sbetween London and New t York, or an unwillingness to r transfer one's home from e London to a new European o headquarters in Brussels or e Geneva. But the problem is Snonetheless a real one. -o American companies have to s offer more than high salaries i if they are-to retain managers of Sthe calibre they need. Many large companies are t run on a \"profit centre \" basis; s managers of subsidiaries are e given profit targets and a con- Ssiderable degree of freedom in Sdeciding how to achieve those n targets. This is the familiar y principle of putting a manager r i the same position which he t would occupy if he were run- 1 ning a business of his own, and i it often works well. Most com- r panics would like to create the Ssort of environment which was t recently described by the chief - executive of Litton Industries- 1 \"Our kind of man is the kind you usually think of as an , entrepreneur, he thinks and acts I as if in business for himself.\" i But this is easier said than done. It is clearly more applic- able to a conglomerate holding company with a large number of separate operating subsidi aries than to a conventionally Sorganised firm in a single line of business. Moreover, the ' profit centre approach does not Snecessarily solve the problem of Sthe individual who is concerned a not so much to run a part of a Sbusiness for himself but to influ Sence the way the business runs. t There was a recent case of a Syoung man who left a large company, which in the last few; years has acquired a reputation for \"modern\" management. This man's concern was to de- velop and accelerate the transi- tion from a production-orietme Sto. a marketing-oriented ap- proach to selling. What this hackneyed phrase involves is a switch in management attitudes~ I nstead of responding to a drop in profits by thinking about tehniqies of production-lhow, can costs bereduced, how*caa-' this rhachine or that be modifiei S. --they, a reqtuitred 'tod think more creatively aboit what te- inaikt needs, whether the pritc structurem capP be changed. Swhthr te poduct itself need to be modified and so on. S Thi is an inadequate descrip- a tion of a process which can be- . er oy complicated, but in thi- articulart case, despite the su- posedly \"modern\" umautfl meat. there was a blockage T! the decision-making - prroc- which prevented the young mar keting man from getting h ideas across. It could be. ron -ally enough, that his departure will spark off the very ohanig which he has been seeking, but the fact remains that, becae\" of bad internal communications the company has lost a manager who will be sorely missed. \"In some organisations.\" to quote Litton again, \"where a man's ideas are knocked down once or twice, he's not apt to come up with a third one. We try to sustain an atmosphem- in which every idea is a good idea-unless proven otherwise We want people to keep throw- ing in all the ideas they have.\" Unfortunately not all good ideas can be translated into action, and it is bitterly di-s appointing when a man who has put his heart into a particular proposal-a new product, a new acquisition, a new research programme-i- told that it has been rejected in favour of a rival proposal put forward by someone else i another part of the company Responses Sometimes the immediate response to such a defeat is resignation (a research scientist. for example, may be able tc find another sponsor for his project). But here again there is a real challenge for the company to try to retain the enthusiasm and support of the man whose ideas .have been rejected. In the current issue of Fortune magazine there L- an interesting account of th- turmoil and heart-searching which went on within Inter national Business Machine before the decision to stake the company's future on the System 360 family of computers. A remarkable feature of the story is that most of the men who had dedicated themselves to th= rival 8000 series (which did not go forward) had the nedessary motivation \" to recover from the shock and throw all their energies into the support of the 360 programme.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF The prediction of lower profits by the Gallaher chairman last May is grimly upheld in to-day's alf-year statement with its cut in dividend (see Lex Page 1), while the difficult situation in the building sector is again under- lined by the statements from United Bulders Merchant and Blndell Permogtlae. Lower half-year profits are reported by Eagii Sewing Cotton (see Lex). In the Property sector there is a reduced dividend from Metro- potan Railway Country Estates and a warning from London Ct- and Westlff. In Confectionery, a merger has been arranged be- tween Ge. Bassett and Barrtt and Co. (see Lex). United Biscuits A full contribution from William Macdonald, against some 4,X months in 1965. rules out a strict comparison of United Biecuts' in- terim figures. But it is evident that margins are still under pressure. Turnover is 10 per cent. up at Â£24.3m., while pre-tax profits-afte- an 18 per cent. jump in deprecia- tion-are only 5 per cent. better at Â£1.91m. The sequence of profit margins thus reads 7.87 per cent., against 8.25 per cent. for the com- parable 28 Weeks and 9.1 per cent. for 1965 as a whole. Total profits \"at least\" equal to last year and a repeated 13 per cent. dividend are envisaged. In fact, the group has done well to make any progress at all so far. Overall national growth is minimal -only 1.1 per cent. in 1965-and competition is getting keener, par- ticularly with groups like Marks and Spencer at the retail end. How- ever, United has shown a better- 'than-average performance so far; and with around 30 per cent. of the market and extensive reorgani- sation still in progress it is presum- ably hoping for an increased share and some relief from the pressure of costs. So is the share price, at 25s 3d to yield 5.2 per cent. and selling on a prospective P/B ratio of 12.4:1 assuming unchanged profits. Judge International Still busily remoulding its image, Judge International has made pre- tax profits of Â£131.000 in 1965-66. against Â£100,000 forecast and Â£81.000 for the previous 15 months. This looks encouraging, but the total includes an Un- specified 15 months' contribution from the new can-opener sub- sidiary. Since the lattet's profits were said last October to be run- ning at around Â£25.000 a year, the Â£100,000 forecast for the group was probably on the cautious side. Sales showed a \"marked\" overall in- crease and are continuing to rise, although a worsening in current trading conditions would affect plastic household goods-account- ing for the highest proportion of profits. However, the dividend is 12 per cent as forecst (covere .11 times by available profts) and a one-for- four scrip issue is proosed. Nc tax charge is included n the pre' liminary statement, but it looks to e rather higher than 40 per cent. Although the group wees its main future in plastics, the range or \"Penthouse\" ovenware launched ast January has been a saceas and here is a new raoge of frying pans This section of the- group bas a ufficient order book for a year so the question-mark is over the hort-term outlook for plastics. The share price rose Is to s this week. but is still considerably less than hbt 1966 \"high\" of 11s 3d. Cocm id&ring the P/E ratio is 8.3:1 and the yield 7.8 per cent. the market Spptars to have discounted a lot of the uncertainties. Ransome & Marles Folowing a poor first half-year due [to dislocation of production. Rmpome and Marks Bearls just about held its own during the second half and pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 last emerge Â£198,000 lower at Â£1.280m. But it looks as though, the crunch could come in the current year. nTe group sells a large part of it production to the motor industry. and to BMC in particular; it may be difficult to avoid some short time working or cutback in production. The total dividend is bein- maintained at 17 per cent. but it looks vulnerable since cover for the current payment is just under 1.4 times; fortunately, however, the balance-sheet at June 30; 1965, snowed no pressure on liquidity with net funds amounting to over Â£400,000. But uncertainties a-r acknowledged in the .share price which is just 3d above the year's \"!ow\" at 11s 64 compared with a \"high\" of 17s 6d; yield is 7.6 per cent. and the P/E ratio 9.5 : 1 Perak River Demand for tin has been well ahead of supply for some tim- now. This, plus growing industrial demand for electricity in Malaysia, shows through in. the results of Perak River Hydro-Electric Powe for the second year running. Profit- nre Â£1.44m. before tax for 1965-66 against Â£1.17m. last year and Â£716,000 the year before that. The dividend is maintained at 20 per cent. but at least the results have eased the sting of corporation tax. Cover is 1.3 times for the yield of 11.4 per cent. at 36s 9d. There is no reason to look for any setback in the current year. Tin remains in undersupply and industrial demand should continue to increase if Malaysia's economic plan is successful. Perak River Hydro has been negotiating bulk $npply arrangements with the Malaysian National Electricity Board as well and generating capacity was being geared up to cope with the expected rise in demand. The Â£1 Ordinary have gained I s 6d in the past year, but all things considered they still look firmly based.",

Half-time figures from United ullders Merchants show a rise of 4.6 per cent. to Â£463,000, before tax, but profits in 1965-66 dropped ,2 per cent.. so U.B. is not mak- ing much impression on current problems.

Each Â£100 nominal amount of loan stock will be convertible into 100 Ordinary S. shares of Bassett in the period July 15 to August 31 in the three years 1970-72. Consolidated profits before tax of Barratt for 1965 amounted to about Â£425,000-in the recent interim state- ment it was announced that profits for the six months ended June 30, 1966 were expected to be a \"little less\" than these for the corresponding period in 1965. Bassett's profit for 1965-66-included Â£68,000 \"exceptional profits.\" It is intended to preserve the identity of Barratt and to safeguard the interests of employees and pensioners, Bassett and Barratt have been advised by Kleinwort Benson and S. G. Warburg and Co. It is antici. pated that the formal offer will be posted by mid-October. See Lex Page 1 CHADBURNS Further details are announced by Chadhtbas Holdings rerding the already reported cqustion o the Clayton Crame and Hois Compsay and Clayton Safeguard. It is recalled that in his statement for the year to March 31 1966 Mr. D. C. Bamford, chairman of Chad. burns, said it might prove diffiult to maintain earnings in the current year. He now estimates that due to economic pressures the pre-ta profit for 196667 will amount to approxi- mately Â£120,000, against Â£141.000. To this will be added profits of Clayton from August 25, 1966 to March 31, 1967, making an estimated r profit of Â£135,000 for the year. In. clusion of a full year's profit of Clayton would have resulted in an estimated group pretax figure of Â£150,000. Subject to the unavoidable effects of the .deterioration of the national economy Mr. Bamford retains his confidence in the future of the group. which is \"greatly strengthened\" by the acquisitions. HARRIS LEBUS Harris Lebus announces that the amount received for the sale by its subsidiary Eventide Beddilg for the trade mark and trade name \"Even. tide.\" is less than 5 per cent. of the group net assets.

   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-29",
   "text_content" : "For 1966 Ballito Hosiery Mills is likely to incur a loss of at least Â£180,000. This forecast is given by chairman Mr. F. V. Ault in the formal offer on behalf of Courtaulds for the company's capital. Terris were reported earlier this month. Mr. Ault adds that while it is impossible to predict, a loss for 1967 of anything up to Â£100,000 could well occur. Thereafter the directors hope that remedial steps will become effective so that profits should again be earned in 1968. Having regard to a situation in which the company must continue to rely heavily on bankers for support and taking into account losses which appear likely to be sustained during the period, the Board considers it \"most improbable\" that the com- pany will be in a position to pay dividends on the Ordinary before .1969, and even then it will only be possible by reorganising and ration- alising all aspects of the business during the next two or three years. The dividend on the Preference shares has so far always been paid but continuing losses could place this in jeopardy, warns the chairman, It is hoped that contracts will shortly be exchanged for the sale of the St. Albans factory premises for a sum \"considerably\" in excess of book value, but proceeds will be insufficient to discharge indebtedness. The outstanding debenture of Â£215,000 secured by a mortgage on the factory will have to be repaid, closing the factory will involve con. slderable expense in removing machinery and transferring personne and redundancy payments also wil have to be made. In addition the overdraft now totals Â£667,000 and there are outstanding loans from hire purchase companies amounting to Â£257,000. Since end 1965, there has been an increase of about Â£260,000 in the value of stocks. In all the circumstances and after consultation with Lazard Brothers and Co., financial advisers, the directors recommend the offers.

   "text_content" : "By H. A. N. BROCKMAN, Our Architectural Correspondent A general view of the new factory. The contrats ol building masses and the buff, grey and dark green of the building materials look we n spite of the uncertainty ol the tower form. * As you come through Ban- bury from the east the produc- ion tower of Bird's factory loses the view on the way out of the town. It is not a very ood tower because its form is broken. Starting with eight high toreys as a slab it shoots up a frther 30 feet or so at one end where tall outcrops of machinery nd plant are concentrated. The ladding, however, is handsome; : curtain wall of windows with iery dark green glossy aprons. ihe top hamper usually and necessarily to be found above he roof line of a production building such as this is screened by a seven-foot high fascia of vertically ribbed aluminium seet But in spite of this attempt to rotect the view from a visually intidy external economy, little bits of chimney and cowling isist on sprouting above the enclosure, so that the distant view from ancient Banbury own has no defence against this rather offensive chevaux-de-frise. No Pre-planning The reason for this is pretty clear on closer inspection of the factory. Industrial and produc. tion considerations dictated a auqik result following the initial decision to build on this site. There was therefore no pre- planning. This meant that the positioning and inter-relation of plant and services were not con. sidered as to their final effect on the public appearance of the finished job. What was done here seems to me to have followed from a prime error on the part of the factory developers. It arises from the perrectly reasonable but solely practical views of an in- dutrial client; Having decided \"what he wants he musters his forces and recruits the best in. dustrial architect available to give those preconceived notions a decent exterior consistent with a price. No better arcbitectursl ,holce d have been made in tbhiaaAJ,|J. Douglass Mathews Stf (now Mathqws 11yati; di!mpson) have proved Sin 'of the outstanding corn iadons they have so ably Ird. ; Care in Design a d buildings don't come ow this way, as can be s ,i .,jbury, in spite of over- all defe of care in design and etailing where such was ill. The close view bears Vlq \"ut as the buildings are poM on the way round the 47. oare site. Buff-coloured bricks are used for the plain, olean wall. Ing of the two long low ware housqs, with winow lightlng arranged in a continuous band alang the crest of the wall; th: satisying proportionate relation of wall to window makes an imnMdlate impresion. A clean y is b a d to th is. Id reÂ· )n :d to ly l The offices, with one of the lower warehouse blocks to le the right. alumtiuium-clad silo-tower rises above one end of the warehouses and this precedes the main tower block, the features seen from the main street of Banbury. The tower is not only in two heights but the higher portion has suffered.a further mutilation to the tower form by the last- minut omission of one whole section of processing plant. This has taken a chunk out of the entire height of one corner re- sulting in a fortuitous shape which hardly contributes to the attempted cleanliness of form. At the northern end of the tower block the trade effluent treatment plant pushes through the roof with no screen to hide its awk- ward emergence, while the fuel tanks and ancillary plant, stand- ing reasonably alone beside the bullding, are yet painted in a pale colour completely unrelated to the general scheme around. Buff Brcks From the car park on the rising ground in the western corer of the site, however, the best overall view can be obtained. The low warehouse blocks are in the right-hand foreground with the slightly higher services building coming forward to a five-storey office building on the left; buff brick- are used in all cases. With the main tower in the back. around, the building groups build up satisfactorily and th- well.thought-out tongs of th- various structural materials are nicely related. The office building has its ground storey inset so that th- outer supporting columns of the reinforced concrete frame form a covered colonnade around the perimeter. All exposed conorete of columns and the floor and oot edges have a boarded flnish maklnR a satisfyinq combina. Stion with the horizontal bands :if windows and buff brickwork. The surroundings within th: site have unfortunately receive only nte mmiimum or ianuscape treatment, largely because of the need to allocate certain areas for future expansion. Much could be done, however, to improve the closer view by considered planting of trees and shrubs, with an eye to a future maturity which could bring great benefits and pleasure to both users and visitors; there will surely be many of the latter. All this has been considered, but does not appear to be financially justified even as a relatively small addi- tioni to this multi-million-pound enterprise; but grass alone is really not enough. . A stream with trees provided a natural starting point from which to build up a fine land- scape treatment. A few of the trees have fortunately been re- tained and they make a pleasant enough show between the two warehouse buildings, but there has been no further planting as originally proposed. Planning was considerably affected by the stream, a sewer and the natural fall in the site, with the result that warehousing with its singe-storey construc- ion occupies two buildings separated by the stream, at the suthern end of the site, with -roduction areas for Maxwell :ouse Coffee and Birds Custard at the northern end. Office and canteen buildings are placed between.. Office Entrance The court between the office and services buildings and the Devonshire Works building, however, provides a grassed \" amenity\" area which must -ive a good deal of pleasure to those who work alongside It. All personnel come in on the north-west entry from Ruscote Avenue, wher te car parks are situated. The offioo entrance is on that side and a little further in towards the warehouse is the factory staff entry, Factory staff go direct to the first floor lockei and changing rooms and thence to their various places of work along the personnel corridor which links the factory and warehouses at this upper level. The office entrance hall is spacious, light and well finished, with wall linings mainly of finely figured and polished deal. The stair hall is particularly well designed, with polished timber predominating. Three Attitudes It seems that developers of factories and industrial plant in every country take one of three attitudes. There are those who believe that the conditions in which their employees work, the efficiency of their plant and organisation and the appearance and surroundings of their build- ing, together combine in .p bringing them prestige and good a business. There are those on the or other hand who have no truck I with amenity and visual prestige ye and who are'entirely concerned ed with practical means to the end s, of a good return, good produce t and good profits, with the buyer its at one end and the shareholder d at the other. The third attitude be is that of compromise between as the two, but although this can io get by it can never, be wholly d satisfactory. .i. Those who take the first view ad have proved the worth of their is vision in countless enterprises throughout the world. They d have all, I guess, achieved this n by a complete collaboration Ij. between all the major business. he industrial, engineering and e. architectural thinking. A pooled nt co-operation at top level, with ,o each skill, professional and Ire managerial contribution entering as the project in a controlling role at the right moment. In this iy quality of set-up and during the er long. process of pre-plannlng, e, design and erection of the job, Og the architect is expected to have c. a continuous controlling finger - on the final functional and visual ie result. , th When an enterprise of this il magnitude enters the grand rd countryside of Oxfordshire, pro. id viding work and a meed of @a prosperity on the edge of an ancient town such as Banbury, there should be no hesitation in promoting the best in :e every direction, Much all-round he excellence in industrial architec- g, ture has been gradually and 4d increasingly achieved over.ths ust last 100 years. This island is to too small for further spoliation and with all the present well he merited efforts to preserve the et old, those who hold the purse re strlnR must realise their public is responsibility and the import or ance for the future of every ie single new man-made thing they an put into the landscape. r .

The company had been carrying out research for several years and believed there were possibly a dozen regions where new papers could be launched successfully, Both areas now selected had shown big economic growth over the past 10 years. Lord Thomson said: \"Perhaps in another year or so there Will be another one.

The pent-up pressures for wage increases, arising in the freeze and the next six months of restraint, would be difficult to resist, and would call for the maximum of restraint from the unions and great patience, fairness, and statesman- ship op the part of management. Springboard \"We must devise ways of ensur- ing that the ensuing period of restraint is not another free-for-all, but is one of constructive thought and planning and is regarded as a springboard for future growth. The Government must create an economic climate in which in- dustry can be revitalised and can expand. It must control its expen- diture abroad and domestic demand,\" he declared. It would be necessary to provide the vital range of incentives to work hard, to make reasonable profits, to save, and above all, for industry to invest and re-equip. The cumulative effect of narrower profit margins, corporation tax, and the levy on industry arising from selective employment tax was preatly to reduce, if not completely inhibit, industry's ability to re-equip. '-A major reduction in investment was inevitable, he warned. \"'This trend must be reversed and should be given first priority by the Government. Nothing is being done to halt the steady and alarming in- Mr. A. J. Stephen Brown crease in the number of civil servants. nor is there any reduction in our welfare state expenditure ,; gratui- tous handouts are still being made. often to those not really. in need. such as free prescriptions 'and sub- sidies on housing.\" Overseas, no one would advocate the UJ.'s abrogating its responsi bilities for helping developing coun- tries. but it did not make economic sense to lend or give away large sums of other people s money for which Britain had to pay a high rate of interest, he argued.",

DAVID ATTENBOROUGH. head of BBC-2 television, said yesterday that colour television programmes, which will start in the autumn of 1967. will be pro- duced at the rate of 14 hours a wpek. Within a year, he told a trade conference organised by Mullard at its London headquarters, 90 per cent. of BBC-2 programmes will be in colour. \"It will be my ambition to achieve 100 per cent. colour as soon as possible.\" he declared. Mr. Attenborough. talking to an audience representative of Britain's radio and TV trade, went on: \"When you think of colour pto- grammes it is easy to think only of the gaudily spectacular-Troop- ing the Colour, the Chelsea Flower Show, and so on. \"But we have got to remember that, to begin with. 99 per cent. of the viewers seeing colour pro- grammes will be watching them in monochrome. This means that if we are not to break faith with the people who have already in- vested in BBC-2 we cannot put out programmes that are meaning- less unless they are in colour.\" Commenting on how much colour transmission there would be. he said: \"We must get the maxi- mum hours of colour as soon as possible. You can't sell colour TV sets on the basis of three or four hours of colour , spectaculars a week.\" Mr, P. C. McLean, the BBC's Director of Engineering, thought the public would be much more critical of the quality of colour pictures than of the black and white. Expensive Sets Mr. S. B. Allchurch, director of the British Radio Equipment Mknufacturers' Assoclatlon, said that the German PAL colour sysem would be more reliable and likely to need less servicing. It was also much easier to Instal. He said that about 50,000 colour sets were expected to be sold or rented during the irst year of colour TV. The sets, only slightly larger than black-and-whllt re- celvers, .would sell at from 260 gulneas to 310 guineas and be rented at about 35s or Â£2 per week. \"Colour TV should 'open a new market which may become the major growth factor In the industry for the next decade,\" he said."

At that time, it was estimated that as commanicatioils by atllite became more prevalent in thieye ahead, a market for upwards of Â£100m. would be generated in the provision throughout the world of the necessary receiving and tran. mitting stations on the ground. It is to capture as big a share of Shis business - a. possible -that the AEI-Plessey-GEC and the STC. Vickers combines have been formed. Outside these groups, Marconi has already won coptracts for \"comsat\" ground stations, such as in Ascension Island and at the Signals Research nd bDeveionet Establishmet, Christchurch, HIamnpshire. It was announced earlier this yesr by Cable and Wireless that it plann.e to have three comsat\" groun- stations, worth Â£7m., one in Hong Kong, another in Bahrain and the third at aite to be'chosen, perhaps iaso in Hong Kong.

The gas, which is not expected to be in large quantities, has stopped work on a new loading jetty, being constructed by Edmund Nuttall Sons and Co., beside a new lock entrance.

It, was likely that oil products used as reforming agents and feed- stocks would have to make way. That could not be wholly satisfac- tory for the oil producers. But a really strong economy was essential to the U.K. and its overseas account had to be brought into balance. Mr. Marsh stressed that it was in everyone's interest to exploit every opportunity of easing the strain by import substitution and of promoting export by efficient low- cost production to which cheap fuel supplies could contribute signifi- cantly. \"My third and last point is to repeat what I have said elsewhere- natural gas is not a threat to the mining industry. For as far ahead as one can see, we in this country will need every ton of coal that can be produced at an economic price. Efficient low-cost production must be the coal industry's overriding aim and if that is achieved the coal will find a market,\" he said. Earlier Mr. Marsh said'that it was not yet known by anybody how large the reserves of the North Sea would turn out to be. The extent of the fields and reserves so far discovered were also unknown. The refinery, which would save foreign exchange, would make a significant contribution, together with its associated plant, to the advance of technology and to greater produc. tivity.

   "text_content" : "-by O.AVIi PALMER TB -INTlMNATIONAL paran Challgee Trophy, :.-rly known as the \"LI, merica's Cup,\" is once safely in Brltish bands. O ,4ay Lody Helmsman, sailed teg White and crewed byJohn 5born, won the sixth, anial, rl- fully the last race, in a lon, drawn out series against the U.S. Game cock, to take the trophy by four races to two. From the start of the first race there was little doubt of Lady 'Helmsman's superiority over her challenger, particularly on the :indward legs. But both the 'irst two races went to America, and in both cases for the same reason. Lady Helmsman's main ,beam, which joins the two hulls together, and on which her huge 170 Ibs mast is stepped, buckled. In the past, it has been normal *for this beam to be braced by a long dolphin striker, hung under- neath the beam, and connected to the two hulls by wire. This, how- ever, has the disadvantage that it tends to trail in the water in high seas: Lady Hellmman used a dol- phin spring, rather like a car spring, to distribute the weight of her big mast along her main beam. But the beam proved not to be substantial enough to take this amount of strain. One Boat Race The British team found them- selves, somewhat sheepishly, asking the Americans for permission to alter the construction of the beam (which is technically against the rules). The Americans acquiesced (and wondered out loud why the U.K. team had bothered to ask pernission), and from then on the series became a one boat race. Gamecock, however, was improv- ing throughout. After the fourth race, fog and lack of wind gave her crew plenty of time to examine their boat, and they found that she too had suffered from the first day's racing (the only one during the series when it blew really hard). Some water had seeped into her hulls, and the main beam was no longer secure erough to keep the twmblls wareli It aIs. hler. the VaWud hu to a Zlr ffore .and c tmanoeo ' \"[brhull Mett tr. \"This was rectfled, ' l t two race were the Kcle'QC the competition, with am fore ftf timekseping wihin strikin dstkanice of ' , Hrelmrment. Greatest Asset These last two races, however showed up Lady Helmsman's greatest asset--her crew. R White and John Osborn have now siccessfully defended the Little America's Cup twice together. They work as a perfect team, and White seldom. pts a tactical foot 'rong. Last year he beat the straUlan challner. Quest II. by making maximum use of a slower boat In this year's U.K. selection trials he twice edged ahead of Thunder II on the finishing line, -whn his race was all but lost On the other hand, the American pair Jim Bonney and Bob Shiels, had not sailed together before this series, and it is not by chance that the last two racem were their best Given two more and they might have put Lady Helmsman to a harder test. There were, too, some signifi cant differences between the boats themselves. Much attention has been paid to the masts. Both used a \" wing mast,\" that is a large, heavy spar, with a cross section like that of an aeroplate wing. The idea (invented, incidentally, by Gamecook's designer George Patteraon) is that by swivelling the mast, greater control can be had over the flow of the ail, so that it can be adjusted to wind strength and direction. But whereas Gmn-- cock's mast was about 85 square feet, leaving her 215 square feet of sail area. Lady Helmsman'm was 106 square feet, which gave ner a correspondingly smaller sail area. I have my doubts on whether this -mast was as important as most spectators made out; of far more importance was the sail itself. Lady Helmsman, with a shorter mast, carried a full il with plenty of roach in it. amecock's was, by comparison, flat and much spor tri lar-shaped. Perhaps the sllmaker ha relied too much on the wing mast to produce fullness that was not there. The net result was that Gamecock's performance to windward was never as good as Lady Helmsman's. Her crew seemed always to be tryin to sail her too close to the wind, in an attempt to point as high as the British boat. I have always imagined that it must have been an Englishman who christened this series the \"Little America's Cup,\" to make up for the fact that we always lost the big one. Nevertheless, the two series have a remarkable lot in common. Both are match races over long courses, using boats that ar specifically built for their respec- tive competitions. Both cats and 12-metres represent the ultimae in speed and racing ability for their particular size of boat. The major difference is in cost-a 12-metre can cost over Â£200,000, a C-class cat could probably be built from scratch for about Â£3,000. Britain has now won this series six times in six years-years which have seen more and more radical developments in the designs of the boats. Even if we cannot build 12- metres, this is a satisfying second best",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Our Mining Editor Thne importance of applying a yardstick of higher production to any selection of tin-mining invest- ments during the current period of lower metal prices, stressed in our Monday mining column, was amply illustrated yesterday morn- ing when the Cornish producer, South Crofty, announced its results for the first seven 28-day periods to July 9 of its thirteen-period year to December 31 next. These showed that the net profit before tax had dropped from Â£221,000 to Â£102,000. The taxed surplus comes out at Â£83,000, against Â£140,000 after crediting an exceptional receipt of Â£36,000 arising from the sale of low- grade tinny-wolfram concentrates accumulated over the past four years and which until recently have been impossible to dispose of at a realistic price. 'In these circumstances shareholders will probably consider themselves lucky that the interim dividend is only being cut by 25 per cent. to 9d, whereas the available profit is down by 41 per cent. Last year's final was 2s 6d,4. South Crofty has maintained its throughput but lower ore grade has brought its output of concentrates down to 607 tons for the eight month. to Aulust 31 from 705 tons in the same period of last year. The aver- age metal price in 1965 was Â£1,413 *a ton. The cash quotation in London is currently only Â£1,215. The com- pany's 5s Ordinary shares were un- changed yesterday at 27s 3d. They were 39s 3d earlier on this year. CLEVELAND TIN ESTIMATES Some more details have come to hand of the Cleveland Tin flotation in Australia in which Parings share- holders are being offered rights at par as outlined here on September 9. On the basis of a 250,000 tons per annum ore throughput the annual profit is put at just over SAlm. (Â£0.4m.) which would be equivalent to 13.7 per cent. on the proposed capital of SA7.4m. It is stated that SA293,000 would be exempt from tax and SA720,000 would be tax- able in shareholders' hands. The estimate is made on the basis of current reserves and metal prices. The reserves at this Tasmanian pro- perty, which will be effectively con- trolled by Aberfoyle Holdings are now put at 3.19m. tons of 0.91 per cent. tin and 0.38 per cent. copper which is considerably greater than the initial estimate given here on September 9. This would give the mine a prospective life of over 12 years while there is reckoned to be a good possiblity of further re- serves being proved, the ore system bnei still open at both ends and in 't should be noted that the tin price assumed for the profit estimate is Â£1,250 and that for copper Â£350 a ton; The first is rather high by current standards, the second reason- ably conservative. Break-even point is put at Â£820 for tin and Â£256 for copper. Production is expected to start during the first half of 1968. Paringl 4s shares stand in London at argoud 18s 9d.",

   "text_content" : "This is a fair, straightforward Bedda Gabler without many subtleties. There's this ambitious general's daughter, do you see, whose husband has been offered a chair at the university where he can pursue his researches into the dometic industries of Brabant in the\".iddle Ages. He suddenly fitW:thaf he's got to compete for the post gainst a reformed dipso who has just published a \" History of Civilisation and has already completoedl ti liant sequel. So this tou I iiets the competitor drinking ain and burns the manu- script of his tew masterpiece, so leaving the field clear for her husband I never felt the plot sticking out so much before. The rest, Hedda's obsession with moulding the des- tinies of men, the machinations of the sinister Judge Brack, and so on, aW positively melodramatic agalni t 4bur-square a story. The Judge's lait.equivocal exclamation, \"people dbn't do such things.\" sounds even harder to explain than usual. Mutatis mutandis, people do such things all the time. Even when Hedda is feeding the Smanuscript page by page into the fire she seems quite unmoved; she never even had a look at the title- page before she begins on it One reason, I think, why every- . one's behaviour seems so uncom- Smonly ordinary is because from Sthe very start they set an Sunnaturally high emotional level in Stheir speech. Aunt Juliane (Marie- Slaine Douglas) talking to the maid Sabout the Tesmans' new domestic y arrangements seems positively o hysterical. Naturally when the r time comes for people to sound . justifiably hysterical the effect is a muted S John Tordoff has given Georg- Tesman a whining, shop assistant's t voice that sounds as if it ought s to belong to a TV comic, and SMichael Meyer, the translator, has f peppered his part with \" eh, whats\" ' and \"by Joves\" that never sound c natural, however faithful they may e be to the Norwegian. But it's a Sconvincing performance otherwise, scurrying about the stage like a in beetle walking on its hind legs. ., Hedda is strong and rather for- .bidding as played by Ursula Smith, c an intellectua' rather than a society beaiuty sib could do with a mite more surface emotion, it seems t me, especially with the others fng away all round her. Harold Innocent's Brack is the only one who stays down at her tamperature; this is a nice cool performance, looking not unlike the young Ibsen himself. Wendy Allnutt is a remarkably attractive Mrs. Elvsted and makes that silly woman as silly as she can without at all cancelling her personal charm; and David Neal as Eilert L6vborg, the one charc- ter who can afford to be demon- strative, makes the most of his chance, radiating a suitable kind of Werther-like romance. The director. Ronald Magill sometimes allows his characters to line up in too rectilinear a forma tion; for example, when Mr. Elvsted has her first conversatio. with the two Tesmans she has to turn through 180 degrees each time she wants to switch her atten tion from one to the other. Bu in general it will do nicely. The opulent set with its loomina tiled stove is by Stephen Don caster."

   "text_content" : "When the theatre's roll-call of the famous really gets going pre- sumably there will be no holding it. Dickens, Dylan Thomas, Wilde -they have all been brought to litf with a wig, some greasepaint, sub- dued lighting, a table and a chair or two. Clearly Shaw was due foi the treatment before long. The trouble with these imper sonations-for they are no more is that they are so horribly well done. We leave an Emlyn Williams evening of Dickens smugly au fait with Little Dorrit, which in fact we have not read in years, self-satisfied with recog- nising the provenance of an extract from an obscure short story after Mr. Williams has muttered the name in an aside. They form painless literary soirees where the talk is witty and the prose often moving, where names are dropped and references are made requring no more effortful reply than a ripple of laughter runnin through the house. Just what this secon- hand hob-nobbing with the eminent achieves I'm not at all su-e. Presumably the answer is an evening's entertainment. And perhaps for many the claim is just. Certainly Michael Voysey's adaptation of Shaw's life and works-an over-grand phrase for a short evening - is entertaining enough for half its length. Shaw's early criticism offers a superb hunt- ing ground. \" Corno di Bassetto's \" description of a Patti farewell con- cert (\"Bel raggio\" and \"Comin' through the rye\") lives up to its famous demolishing final line about her being \"too big a girl for this sort of thing.\" The attempts to lur- Ellen Terry away from the dead hand of Irving are equally fascinat- ing. But once past this .section of Shaw's life Mr. Voysey seems un- certain of his direction. He steers clear of the plays themselves, pre- sumably feeling that they have had exposure enough in the West End recently, and avoids Fabianism, pre- sumably on the grounds that it would make a heavyweight evening. So we jump uncertainly to G.B.S.'s declining years and the death of Charlotte. The actual choice of matter is often wilful and ill balanced, but there is no denying the skill with which Mr. Voysey carpenters it all together. Max Adrian as G.B.S. makes this material, his Voysey inheritance, look 100 per cent. solid stock. The physical resemblance to the profes- sional man of genius is remarkable: the spade beard, the bushy brows rising in twin question marks over the glinting eyes. The voice has no trace of that Levantine whine which has so often been Mr. Adrian's delight, but instead takes on a gentle and disarming Dublin lilt- the very tone for making out- rageous remarks acceptable. Once of twice Mr. Adrian pushes histrionics too far, as in the im- personation of G.B.S. impersonat- ing Irving. But there is compensa- tion enough in the rapt and elco quent reaction to the death of Charlotte and in Shaw's own resig- nation about dying. This episode, though, is un- typical. Most of the evening is about the life force-the will to succeed, to lead, to persuade. And those who prefer their literature taken out of hard covers and dramatised would do well to sample Max Adrian's fine solo verformance.",

   "text_content" : "Yoko Ono-\" born in bird year, who spent her childhood and adolescence collecting skies and seaweeds, and in late adolescence gave birth to a grapefruit and who is at present travelling as a private lecturer\" (so says the programme) -is a name previously known to the writer only as the owner of a spacious loft in New York where some of the most experimental and spectacular events in new music were permitted to happen in the early sixties. In Yoko Ono's loft practically the total oeuvre of LaMonte Young was programmed for a single evening-however, his 'Draw a straight line and follow it' being still incomplete after four hours, it was conceded that the rest of the programme would have to be postponed. This is of course all hearsay, and events 3,000 mile- away are inevitably invested with a legendary character to compen- sate for the absence of the actual experience. Now Yoko Ono is in London, preceded by a friendly double spread in Arts and Artists. Last night a small circle gathered to see her perform at the Africa Centre. Instead of a taxing even- ing of extended and experimental work, however, she gave what can only be described as a highly nolshed recital of her work, con- veniently broken down into short \"pieces,' which were received by the majority of the audience with the kind of reverence usually given to concert pianists. In fact, Yoko Ono is not a musician but a painter, which possibly accounts for her choice of this kind o format. The character of the works was curiously moral and naive. Certain pieces definitely do you good: \"Bag Piece\" for instance, which is a kind of living sculpture. Yoko Ono and her husband disappear into a big black bag and move about inside it in a delicately erotic and tenderly suggestive way to the accompaniment of \"Bicycle Piece for Orchestra \"-a man riding a white bicycle around the auditorium as slowly and. noise- lessly as possible. But my conviction of the uplift- ing quality of the work began to waver in the celebrated \"Cut piece\" which followed. It was impossible to disentangle the corn pulsion of the audience to cut and Yoko Ono's compulsion to be cut. In cutting off pieces of her cloth- ing, members of the audience show unmistakable signs of artistic striv- ing, and she for her part is equally unmistakably striving towards a kind of nerveless detachment, so that all emotional interplay is precluded. As the piece progresses one becomes aware of another kind of nudity underneath the clothing, of her skin. and this inner amorphous nude shape is visible only in her eyes, fixed unwinkingly on the audience. The audience is crucial to Yoko Ono's art, but the other participa- tion pieces seemed like gratuitous games which could not take effect in the short time allotted to them. It is to be hoped that in her second concert (this evening at 7.45 at the Africa Centre, King Street. Covent Garden) she will be able to devote more time and intensity to this side of her activity.",

   "text_content" : "Plato'e Prores, by Gilbert Ryle; Cambridge, 32i 6d. \"Every man, philosopher In- cluded, ends in his own fingertips.\" declared D. H. Lawrence, To the layman whose knowledge of philo. ophy extends little further than an Interest in general ideas and a long-held admiration for Lord Russell's splendid historical outline of the subject, this is a heartening remark, Perhaps an Impression of the Individual philosopher's finger. tip, his life, temperament and point of view is the next best thing to an understanding of phllo- sophical propositions. Bach of these three excellent books helps to provide the lay reader with such a general picture. The hard going is only in patches and In Profes. nor Ryle's case, with the exception of a chapter on \"Dialectic,\" Is non-existent, Plato's Progresa s really more of a revolutionary conjectural blo. graphy of Plato than an account of his system-or systems, since Kyle argues that his thought changed a great deal during his eighty years or so of existence. The closed nature of Plato's thought has been an axiom In the Western world of learning ever since his writlngs were first rediscovered: indeed, it I for this reason that the professor's startling chronological re-count of Plato's life will jive far more pain and offence to cltas- cal scholars and ancient historians than to the philosophers them- selves. As he writes: S Though praising Plato as the Master Thinker history has commonly allowed him no new thinking and certainly no radical re-thinking. He had nothing more to learn from anyone else or even from himself. He never had to correct any serious misl takes of his own or to clear up any confusions in which he had formerly been. He started his explorations with the discovery of his Treasure Island; he had no need or desire to explore any more . . . But ,. . philosophy is not adherence to a tenet or member- ship of a church or party. It is exploration. . . . If Plato was anything of a philosopher, then he cannot have been merely a lifelong Platonist. ., . Having laid down his theory, Ryle proceeds to demolish the accepted general account of PInto's life and set up an entirely original viwpoint of his own, One can only indicate the highlights of this remarkable piece of historical de. tective work t foremost, is the stagl Iring suggestion that the tmit or ocrates in 399 BC, so wonder. ully described in the Socratic dialogues, was in fact the trial of Plato himself in another court ome twenty or so years later \" for he defamation of public men or for driving young men into logical quandaries.\" On this showing, the amous founding of the Academy at Athens was not the realisation of a dream; it was Plato's \" build. In of a raft after the shipwreck of-his teaching vocation.\" Similarly, with Plato's celebrated attempt to found the philosophic tyrant's ideal commonwealth in Sicily; by what (at least to th layman) seems a highly plausible uae of the extant ohronology, Ryle argues that Plato, having arrived in the island to persuade Dionysus i to unite the Hallenes in a Holy War against the Carthaginians, disl covered that the tough old man had just died and that \"his pro* posed Winston Churchill had been succeeded by a rather unexecutive young man.\" On this and all sorts of other problems-the dating or the Dialogues. Plato's discovery or natural isoence relatively late in life, and his relations (soant In deed) with Aristotle, the professor has numbers of stimulating thing. to 1 saV.",

   "text_content" : "The Final Scene The first moment of revelation in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming comes towards the end of Act 1, when Ruth takes the glass of water she has been given by Lenny, offers it to him and then drains it herself. Until then Harold Pinter, as is his style, has been playing us along, dangling us on the end of a string, leaving us anxiously waiting to be pushed in one direction or another. His unspeakable North London family, living in its great grey North London cave, has been intro- duced to us one by one. Max. the father, has his retirement from the butchery business seared by fits of violence. Brother Sam, the best chauffeur in his firm, has carried his dapper, mincing effeminacy well into his mid-sixties. Joey, th- youngest son, is a knocker-down by day in the demolition business and m the gymnasium, and a knocker-up by night of birds on bomb sites. Lenny is subject to the same physical outbreaks as his father on the slightest provocation. This is the ambiance, as will be remembered from Peter Hall's fine Aldwych production of a year ago, for the homecoming of Teddy, the k eldest son, and his wife Ruth. ? Teddy, during his six years of , absence, has grown far away from r the family and become a professor , of philosophy in an American s university. SThe midnight meeting of Ruth and Lenny and the glass that passes n between them have much the same s significance as that other famous a drink of water at the end of Arabella: a break has been made n and a new bond has been forged. Y The pair have recognised that they are kindred spirits, and the way e is pointed to Act 2. Teddy may e have taken on the protective If colourings of his mid-western t campus and now have no more in d common with his family than y blood, but heredity is strong a enough to make him take for n wife the kind of sexy tart that his I relations would have picked. a In Minos Volanakis's production n for the Oxford Playhouse (where P The Homecoming is running in is repertory with Volpone and will * be joined later in the month by Pe The Rules of the Game) the neces- ie sary electricity was not sparked by o, this meeting. A very slow tempo ie was chosen for the first act, with the lines uttered softly and v. sombrely. The total silence of the ly house was only broken by those Sruns of nervous laughter that so Pinter loves to generate. But such is an approach can be too numbing, es and neither Jon Rollason, as er Lenny, nor Heather Chasen. as he Ruth. could produce the sensual er rush of blood the scene demands. fle I'm not at all sure that either fly was well cast. Miss Chasen's peculiarly English beauty and her ko distant manner were not right for ,a. Ruth's sexuality, with its leavening us of depravity. Nor had she the :ct power for the suggestion in the m. final scene that the whole family nd is going to be pitched from the nest he by the cuckoo it has just acquired. tnt Similarly. Mr. Rollason hadn't the )te slickness and bite for Lenny who, his with his Alfa and his high-class clutch of Soho whores, has been just as successful as Teddy accord- ing to his own lights. Elsewhere Minos Volanakis was more fortunate. James Grout gave a superb performance as Max, probably even better than that of Paul Rogers who created the role. The dirty cap, the shirt with stud but no collar, the faded red waist- coat-these were the outward trappings of the role. The frame was still powerful enough to deal a hefty blow to any member of the family when required. But behind this front the cumbersome movements and the ragged voice suggested a life that was beginning to crack; James Grout dropped just Sthe right number of hints that Max's violence was in some measure prompted by a total lack of attention and affection over the years-the play's final line is clue 1 enough. Bernard Brown was the excellent STeddy, set apart from his relatives by his light American raincoat and his horn-rimmed glasses, showing no more than polite academic in- terest as his family decide to take SRuth for themselves and put her on the game in Greek Street. And yet are his actions quite so remote? e Does Teddy realise with relief that t his monstrous family are taking a Smonster off his hands who will outclass the lot of them? The other two sides of Pinter's s tensely dramatic sexagon were ad- s mirably completed by Del Henney (Joey) and Michael Tudor Barnes \" (Sam). The set in peeling Islington r style was by Franco Colavecchia. s r OCJII \"P' V~ IÂ·UUII ~lÂ·lr---lÂ·-Â· S t",

   "text_content" : "by A. CALDER-MARSHALL A Pclture to Hang on the Wall, by Sean Hignett; Joseph; 25s, The Love Department, by William Trevor; Bodley Head; 25s. Sean Hignett's frst novel owes more than a bit of Joyce's Ulysses. The city is not Dublin but Liver- pool (or rather the village which il Liverpool 8). But the hero, Keegan, like Stephen Dedalus, is a lapsed Catholic, hunted by the Hound of Heaven and trying to find in the. Body of Woman a crack Into which to escape. Keegan, ex-art student, bunm bohemian on the dole and the NAB, putting in double.time at Christmas with the panto and the GPO, is a multi-faceted character, Inglorlously trying to dish Norma in order to make Patsy, and yet avoid the love which she, as a lapsed Catholic, could make with him, His motto is, \" I don't work for a living. I get by all rliht.\" Keegan I afraid of life. or love, of God-; yearning for all three, hut chatting them all off with a stream of obscene thoughts and wisle oracks, wanting to be one of the mob for r ar of the pain of find. Ing himself. In his bawdy way he can be funny, Indeed has to be funny to push away the serious- ness which assails him, lovingly. As I grow older, I tend to dislike the boringnes of violence and obscenity; which so frequently s gratuitous. But the ithyphallic young Keegan, portrayed in lusty Inglory, held me interested In the way that the cloddish anti-hero of Sllmitoe's Saturday Night and Sun. day Mornlin never has. Though not to be recommended to queasy readers, A Portrait to Hang on the Wall is a vigorous, sensitive, intel- ligent and courageoul novel of the Mersey*Boatleside, Edward Blakeston-Smith, hero of Trevor's third novel The Love Department, is so much more afrald of life than Hignett's Koee gan that he begins and ends In a monastic retreat on the South Coast, playing draughts with Brother Gregory, The Love Department is a failure, compared with The Old Boys and The Boarding House, but one that must be read by anyone interested in the English novel, both because In bits It Is wildly funny and also to guess what's wrong. My guess is that William Trevor, who works in an advertis. Ing aency has conceived a comedy with a pop-art, comIo. trip plot nd a fastidious style. Lady Dolores Boulhardle, the almost spherical 4 foot 6 inches* high, married love adviser to a woman's magazine, Septlmus Tuam the phllanCere of Wimbledon Mrs. Hoop the malevolent charlady and the rest, are comic-trip characters, desoribed In a preclous, or at leas preolse .ark-Wough.

   "text_content" : "by TREVOR BAILEY Although the football season has only just begua certain treads and patterns have already emerged. It was hoped that England's triumph in the World Cup this summer would bring about an increased interest in the game which, in its turn would be reflected by increased attendances at league matches. The winning of the greatest trophy in soccer was unquestion- o-by an inspiration which has pro- duced a surge of enthusiasm among players at all levels. Despite the economic squeeze, the demand for football gear and playing pitches has never been greater, while there is no way of gauging the ultimate effect that the World Cup series, which was so splendidly covered by television and has also been made into a quite remarkable sporting film, will have on the youth of the country who must provide to-morrow's stars. Person- ally, I believe that this will prove considerable, a view which has been confirmed by a number of schoolmasters, who have all reported intense keenness and a- added appreciation which bodes well for the future. Nevertheless, the gate figures at league matches so far this season hardly suggest a soccer renais- sance. At First Division level, there has been some improvement and this is also true with certain Second Division clubs, such as Birmingham, who had been able to find the money to purchase new players of sufficient calibre to attract the public, at least for as long as pro- motion remains a possibihty. However, the story in the Third and Fourth Divisions is mainly of large overdrafts, reduced staffs, economy drives, and desperate struggles to make ends meet. Ex- cept for the fortunate few, who are potential promotion candidates, or enjoy a lengthy run in the Cup, this unhealthy state of affairs is bound to continue, because foot- ball in these divisions is not really San economic proposition. It was hoped that some of the needed spectators would come from those t who have thrilled at the exploits of Mr. Ramsey's team last summer, e but this was wishful thinking. The g demand has increased for the best i football, hence larger gates in the t First Division, but not for the fare i provided by teams from the bottom Shalf of the Fourth Division. It seems probable that there will e have to be some positive reorganisation of the Third and t Fourth in the not too distant future s on a regional basis, possibly into d three groups-North, Midland and g South-if all the clubs are going -to survive. e The battle for the First Division r championship, spurred on by d bigger crowds and with the golden ? incentive of European football next t season for the winning club, is adeveloping into an absorbing il struggle, made all the more interest- ing by the fact that no fewer than Sten of the contestants possess the Sability and the potential to carry Soff the title. The general standard s of play is certainly very high. n At the moment, Chelsea are the a. pacemakers, perhaps because they do not appear to be relying on sheer haste to quite the same extent as they had done In the past. Both Osgood and Cooke ire prepared to hold the ball and probe for an opening. Although Chelsea are clearly more than a competent side, a question mark still remains about their mental stamina when the .., pressure builds up. Last season's champions, Liver- pool, have not as yet appeared quite so commanding, and I have my doubts about whether they can dominate home football for the fourth successive year. They pos- sess great experience which should prove invaluable when they try to become the first English club to win the European Cup, but there are signs of creaks and cracks which suggest that they may be past their best. SManchester United have, not sur- prisingly, scored more goals than any other club, but they have also conceded 15 in nine matches. which is not the way to carry otff the league championship, and which means that they will have Sto tighten their defence. Whether this can be achieved without re- moving some of the colour from t the most flamboyant attack in the 1 country is a moot point. Although Stoke and Tottenham are currently second and third in Sthe table, I prefer the chances of- the underrated Leicester, who could Seasily prove to be the surprise Steam of the year. Leeds, who have been seriously handicapped by injuries, have yet to find the rhythm which made them one of d the most feared teams in the f country, while West Ham, despite the presence of three World Cup ' players, started with three succes- C sive defeats, and are still search- \" ing for a really convincing formula. e I fancy them for the Cup rather Sthan the league. \" At the wrong end of the table Fulham look as if they will once Sagain be struggling to avoid rele- is gation, Blackpool are plainly miss- d ing the inspiration of Ball, and Aston Villa's defence is very vul- ; nerable.",

There is niothing static, bow'. ever, in our changing world and recent research has tended to Sshow that the Abominable No. Man is being replaced by the Prohibitive Procrastinator. In- stead of saying \"No\" the PP says 'lh due course\" (scentifc* ally, IDC), these words fore- shadowing Negation by Delay (scientifically, ND). The theory of ND depends upon establish- ing a rough dea of what amouqt of delay will equal degation. Judicious Pause If we suppose that a drowning man calls for help, evoklng the 4 reply \"In due course,\" a Judl oious pause of five minutes may constitute, for all praotieal pur. poses, a negative response, Why? ecause the delay is greater than the non-swimmer's expectation of life. The same principle holds good in a cas at law. A, S is, y years low since .bte IMa 'In everyf o .A.tio , is now fb* bility, t to. savs them s\" from tC work w -iea; pokitv , decisiosn, iht invove.

To say \" no \"is far less of.:a hazard, for nobody can then prove that the action proposed wol have, served the end in view. To the NoMan, *therefore, negation .-is an end in itself, avoiding the pit, fallis and ef-ort which might result from saying \" yes.\" It has also been proved that \"No-Men\" and \"Yes-Men\" alternate at different levels of authority and that none of them is affected by argument When the answer is \"no\" the correct response is not to argue but to hb IdÂ· res:- m.

Je the InÂ· PPÂ· ire lay Hy: ohÂ· 19t IdlÂ· lay UIÂ· lyl~ lan People have nked for a long time how Parkinson's famous Law came to be formulated-what in fact makes Parkinson tick. In his forthcoming book, A Law Unto Themselves, he will give the. answer, not in the form of straight autobiography, but a series of portrait sketches of. people who have inluenced him most divorced from B; demands the custody of their daughter (aged 17) but is told by counsel that she will be of age abefore the case can be determined. At the retail level, A iA told by hisriron. monger, B, that, the: lawnmower he wants caaibedelivered in six- monthsAb(i.e6 b~v December).iAll these are examples of ND in its simpler forms. New Dimension Where the urgent matter re- quires remedial legislation, delay takes on a new dimension. The judicious pause still :ofresponds, however, to the life4expectation of the man from whom the pro- posal originates. If it is the divorce laws which obviously need revision, the Prohibitive Procrastinator starts, by asking about the age and health of the reforner whose Bill It is. Taking the age of 70 as th6 basis of his calculation modifed by actuarial factors. he concludes that Re. former A may expect tO agitate for another eight years. Nega tipn by Delay means the process of ensuring that in due course\" will mean, In this Instance, nine yeart from now. Realisatlon that the IDC is greater than the 'Reformer's expeted life of agitation (LiA)s Ioften enough to kill the whole idea at the out. set. For many altruistic men the knowledge that the thing cannot be done in their lifetime is equivalent to the knowledge that Sit cannot be done at all. Where Sa useful reform takes place, as m must occasionally happen, this Sis: the result of the Reformer's living':and workin 'for ydars Sbeynd th'liinits of reasdnabt Sexpectation. , S The Reformer may thus out- live the PP, whose especial hatred is of reformers much younger than himself. There are cases, therefore, where the IDC factor is less than the LA and r some half-hearted legislation is Sthe result. But men like Sir Alan Herbert have never been Snumerous and they are tending, in fact, to become extinct. The Saverage reformer or innovator gives up more easily, leaving the PP in a position of strength, Sready to defeat the next pro- Sposal by, sing the same tech. nique. Delays are thus Sdeliberately designed as a form Sos denial and are extended to cover the life expectation of the person whose proposal is being Sigeod-holed. DELAY IS THE SEADLIEST FORM OP DENIAL. This is Parkinion's Law of Delay. In mathematical terms it is represented by the Sequation: I Where L-LA or the expected i life (fqr all practical purposes) Sos the. person from whom the Sproposed reform orginates, Mm I IDC or the time elapsing be. tween the first proposal and the final solution, N= the number of extraneous Isues brought into the discussion,' and P=.the age of the Prohibitive Procrastinator, (L+N)' Then x is the amount of delay which is equal to denial. . At.this point it is necessary to emphasise that the PP seldom says outright. \"This cannot be done in. your lifetime.\" He allows this fact to emerge in the course of discussion. \"Our best method,\" he will begin, \" is to form a Committee on Procedure. \"This will produce an Outline Proposal, the various parts of which will be referred to Sub- Committees formed to deal with the Legal, Financial, Cynical, Technical, Political, Hysterical, Statistical, Ineffectual and Habi- tual aspects of the scheme, The Sub-Committees will report back to the Committee on Procedure, which will'then issue an Interim Report. This should be laid before a Commission of Inquiry, which will assemble not later than 1973. It will be the object of the Commission to recom- mend the procedures which we should adopt in deciding, first of all, whether there is a case for proceeding further in the matter.\" Pausing for breath, the PP will complete, on the back of an envelope, his calculations as to how much Delay will equal Negation. Having outlined a process which will continue until, say, 1975, he realises that 1980 is the target date. So he continest as follows: 'Supposing-a, d I emphsr ise that t.e question is. rore tdan-a towsalit-uppposingo that. thee is a case for action,, the Com- mission's final report will go to an Intef-Departmental Working Party, which will advise on the composition of the Planning Committee. It will be the task of the Planning UnderSecretary of State, who will bring the matter before the Minister. Should his reaction be favour- able, the matter will be brought up at the Party Conference at Skegness, It will be for the Party to decide whether the Time is Opportune, so soon before (or possibly so soon after) the General Election. In the light of that decision it will be for the Minister to issue a directive, He would not, how- ever, at that stage, do more than accept the need. in principle, for further investigation.\" End of Argument That is usually enough to end the matter without a single argu. ment being used against the pro. posal under discussion, All the Reformer can see before him, is an endless vista of Committees trying to decide whether there is it ary ene oso sitt pla niq stre wo on the d1s( ruk ie'n ist of in i is sec are Thl tute all] reo alse The the log gid nol Th tha We del pec pet Th asb : the ta; tar cia ~ bet ,~ the t Th r r. i,, L bel ral all bel For on is wr of lin the Fa Atl to clu esC WI Ing wr in no Â·o0 from A towards B, the bridge being blown up at X and the railhead destroyed at Y, with all communication interrupted between you and the next higher formation. With shells bursting on all sides, the harassed officer is supposed .to sit down and write \"Appreciation\" at the top Iof a sheet of foolscap, under- lining it before going on to add the details of his Aim, the I Factors which might affect its 1 Attainment, the Courses open Sto either side, and the Con. ' lusion to which he is in- escapably driven. No marks were ever awarded for conclud- ing that the Army was the wrong profession to have chosen in the first place. There can he no doubt, however, of the value *of this mental exercise. Whether is a case for making a prelimin- ary inquiry into terms of refer- ence for a Commission. Comit. ology (the Science of Committee- sitting) is an old method of playing for time, but the tech. niques of delay have been strengthened in the modern world by the current emphasis on research. In matters scientific, the first rule, as we know, is to discover the facts. The same rule, as applied to human prob- lems, means that a crime wave is not a matter of principle but of measurement. If negroes riot in Los Angeles our first reaction is to count the negroes, our second to decide whether they are as black as they are painted. That fact-finding is thus a substi- tute for decision is very gener- ally known. What we fail to recognise is that fact-finding is also a substitute for Thought. The months we spend in hearing the views of statisticians, psycho- logists, graphologists, sociolo- gists alchemists and alienists are not merely months of inaction. Their effect is to smother our thought incwaves of irrelevance. We have to realise that decisions depend upon the existence of people with a general as well as a specialised knowledge, upon people who are often a Law unto Themselves, upon people who ask \"Why not? more often than \"Why?\" Appreciation Art Army officers used to be Staught, and indeed may still be taught, how to make an Appre- ciation. In doing, this, one Sbegan (it might be) with a n. theoretical position of crisis. t The enemy would be advancing [v tiheÂ· ' ift.

In practice,, however, the real stumbling block was always the AIM paragraph. For most pepplo t is far more difficult to decide what 'they are trying to do than to describe how they propose to set about it. As for the Factors which affect the situation, as seen from either side, they are only relevarit in so far as they relate to the Aim. If the Aim is wrong, therefore, nothing.else in the Appreciation Will be right. This observation is as true m peace as in war and the born leader is one who con- siders his Aim first and the statistical position afterwards. The leader of to-day has many obstacles to overcome and Delay is often the worst of them. But technical progress has in some ways come to his rescue. There has been, for example, a great improvement in the process of duplication, the multiplying of legible docu- ments for swift circulation. Memoranda are usually valu- able, coming from those who are most active and therefore best informed. They come, Sabove all, from those who have done their thinking beforehand. We find, moreover, that in at least three respects the writer of a circulated memorandum has an advantage over his col- leagues. He has defined his I purpose. He has undermined the confidence, in committee, of those who have failed to read it. He has provided, finally, what will. probably be the basis of what is agreed. But memoranda are less important, perhaps, than correspondence. And if there is one device which can do moi 3 than another to promote the dispatch of business it is the forwarding of letters in xero- graphed duplication. Instead of dictating a reply, the receiver can write his answer in the margin of the duplicate: \"Agreed,\" \"Impossible,\" or, merely \"Rubbish I\" It might fairly be asked, at this, stage, whether the multipli- Continued on nemt page",

   "text_content" : "Rank Xerox has built up a copying business with a revenue of more than Â£40m. in its last trading year-nearly three times the 1963-64 figure: the comr pany's 914 and 813, machin-- have becomean accepted feature of well-managed offices in more ian 20' countries. Now t1. company is widening the use of xerography so that it not only covers copying but extends into the far larger field of duplicating. The simplicity and convenience of copiers is well established. However, the economics of their operation works against them when a considerable number 0o copies are required from one document-a copy usually costs he same whether one or 50 ar- made. For reasons of economy many cost-conscious office managers carry out longer-run :opying on duplicators. Although this involves a high cost factor in time and delay in the prepara- ion of stencils or masters, xeroduplicating combines the implicity of copying with the conomy of duplicating. The four new 'xero- duplicators' have one unique advantage: they work straight rom the original document without the need for any stencil or master. A xeroduplicator will have started to produce copies before the first paragraph could be typed on to a stencil- the whole run will probably be completed on the xerodupllcator before the typing could be completed. Before the 914 copier came on the scene, it was not unusual for a businessman to have to wait a dav, or even longer, to get a copy of a document. Now he knows that he can demand a fast copying service, but he is unlikely to be able to get duplicating done with similar despatch. STake a simple example: a meeting of IS people is just about to start when one .of the participants arrives with a docu- ment which needs to be in the hands of everyone around the table. The smallest of the xero- duplicators (the desk-top 330) will produce the required number of topies in three -minutes: the largest (the 2400) will do the job in one minute. Short-run Work On this short-run work, the actual speed at which the machines operate is less Im- portant than the cycle time between when the need arises and when the copies are ready for use. As the length of run increases, the relative importance of machine speed increases; this is reflected in the machine speeds of the xerodupllcators- the 2400 runs at seven times the speed of the 330. The designa- tions of the xeroduplicators 330, 420, 720 and 2400-indicate their rate of output per hour. The machines are fitted with reducing-scale meters, so that the cost per copy declines as the length of run increases, There is no expense-in time or materials-for master-making or for re-typing the original on to any special kind of material and there is no \"make-ready\" on the machine and no need to run trial copies. With the ever-rising costs of wages, the Selective Employment Tax, and all the problems of recruiting and keeping skilled office staff,' it becomes in- creasingly important to make efficient use of oflice time. Xeroduplcatipg offesi a new way. of cutting out dlays in office procedures, cutting down the possibilities of error (which are always present whenever anything has to be re-typed) and consequently saving time by making re-checking unnecessary. Why tie up expensive office staff doing chores which can be handled much more quickly and efficiently by machine? Rank Xerox is making every effort to put this point across as dramatically as possible, and to give businessmen every opportunity of seeing for them- selves the advantages xero- duplicating can offer them. The idea was launched in the spring, when an airliner was converted into a flying show- room to demonstrate the 2400. The plane was visited by 10,000 businessmen in 28 cities during a two-month tour of 13 European countries, This autumn the xerodupli. cators will be demonstrated at no fewer than 20 major business exhibitions in Britain and Europe, including, of course, the Business Efficiency Exhibition at Olympia. The xeroduplicators can also be seen in action at all the Rank Xerox showrooms, and a new travelling showroom Is touring Britain to give one-the-spot demonstrations to potential users."

   "text_content" : "AN EXAMPLE of a company which has gone over entirely to xeroduplicators for all their reprographic requirements above five.,or six copies, is provided by Bovis, the well- known builders who are one of the Bovis group of companies. The nature of their business is different from any other build- ing contractii r nd, eve more that theit rivals, demands an efficient and reliable copying service. Fee System Bovis never tender for a contract: they rely on their reputation and -.on personal recommendation to get them their work, aqd~ they charge a fee for their services. The con- struction work is carried out by their own labour and by sub- contractors, but Bovis charge. their customer only the actual net cost of the work, together with their agreed fee. This- system, which Bovis have fol- lowed with evident success for 40 years, assures the client that the contract will result in the maximum value for money for him, since Bovis reputation is staked on getting exactly the right mix of time, quality, economy and service. Common Problems All builders have copying problems. Bills of quantity- quotations-all must be repro- duced quickly and accurately. In addition, Bovis have to ensure that each invoice that comes in-and they receive about 1,200-1,300 per week-is assigned to the appropriate clients' accounts. About half of The two 420 xeodapJatotm In ue sit t SBo, td. them are w duplicate, but the other half, in original only, hav- to be copied. So with the aid of a Rank Xerox 420 xero -uplicator, a copy is made-the original is used by the Accounts Department for payment pur- poses, and the copy goes into the \"stock copy\" file as evidence for the client and a permanent record. Bulky Items Bovis estimators too' draw heavily on the services of the two 420s the company uses. Speed here.is often of great imn portance, particularly as one or the main virtues of the Bovis \"no tender\" scheme is that up to ix morths pre-tortact time can- be saved. This .wy, when a cifent is in a hurry, Boris can have their men working on the site very much sooner than using the conventional approach. Bills of quantity are the most commen and bulky items to be copied. These come in from the Quantity Surveyor, and some sections of them have to be abstracted and passed to tnc sub.contractors for pricing Occasionally, up to twenty copies are required for one trade, and it is interesting to note that only the relevant part of the original document is copied, the items not referring to that trade being simply blanked out, This is easily done on a. 420 since the flat copy ..laten allows quick and accurate postionng of, the. mask and original Nede to say, the effort invlvd in retyping such list wo~ d be epensave, slow and open to transcription errors. When a quotation for a job is received by Bovi from the sub- contraqtor, sad accepted, the * complete document, containing * eiic4detais of what the sub- contrator agrees to do, is copied and xeroduplicates are sent to the site and to the pro- sessional officers concerned Staff inStru\"toi are alsO pro duced on the 429. These cover administration as well attechif- cal matters, and the circulation list for them is formidable. There are 130 external addressees -sites and so on-each of which receives a copy, and an internal list.of 70 making a total required of 200 copies. Some of these documents deal with increasingly techhical and specialised matters, and consequently are gtting more bulky as ew technologies take over fromt traditioial a methods. >e Other tevs - >g Other items that ate speeded - up by xerography are the bud. st gets for circulation to directors,. w the minutes of board weetings ke -and many other internal docu- i men*.

The plant occupies over 30 acres of Gloucestershire countryside and 2,000 people work there.- A large percentage of the total area is taken up with production lines, making copying machines for international 'distribution. Two big factors in'the produc- tion of these machines are com- ponent reliability and quality control. For a rental business. to be commercially successful, the equipment must be efficient, so that the customer can rely on it in daily use. With an ever increasing num- ber of michines .in service, maintenance costs must be kept low;. Too many service calls could quickly reduce or wipe out profit margins. Reliability test- ing and quality control help to keep both manufacturer and customer satisfied. Research Team A great deal of time and scientific know-how goes into reliability research at Mitchel- dean. A highly specialised re- search team is responsible for ensuring that all special or criti- cal components, as they are called, work with a minimum failure rate during their useful life. A copying machine contains some 150 critical components. Prototypes of these components, which include relays, switches, motors, quartz heaters, ,timers and power units, are carefully examined and subjected to gruelling electrical and mechani. cal life tests at the Reliability Laboratories. The scene in the laboratories could be straight out of a science fiction film. Pulsating green and yellow lights, chatteringrelays, sophistl. cated metering equipnent and ingenious mechanical testi)g devices remind one of the adventures of \" Dr. Who.\" But the mnie bent over these test bays are real.life enginers, their Job is to test components beyond their normal limits of operation. If a component falls before the limit has been reached they Afnd out why. When the reason has been dis covered, modifications are made until the component reaches specification limits. A typical example of the rigorous tests carried out at the Mitoheldan plant was a test on an a.c. relay, It was subjected to a make and break contact test at a rate of 10 times a minute, continuously for a period of ive mouths, During that time, a total of 20 million operations, well 'above the relay's normal life,' were re; corded on a special counting meter, These tests showed that te relay could be expected to give at least five years'. trouble ree service. The time of long- trm tests can, however, be re- duced by the use of, statistical prdictions. Data is provided which eliminates the necessity t repeat experiments on which nformation is already known. Quality Control An important by-product of he research that goes into fnalising the industrial relia- bility of critical components is hat the Mitcheldean engineers are able to make useful sugges- ions for moditying and improv- ing the supplier's hardware. This, in turn, assists the supplier himself to. produce better and more reliable components -and enhance his own sales. Once a copier is on the pro- duction line, quality control akes over. This end~res that he machines conform to a rigid specification. At the end of the production line, quality control personnel carry out stringent checks. The whole essence of quality control is to prevent ather than 'to find trouble Statistics are completed on every ault found and regular manage- miet meetings held to decidr whether equipment piodification or further ..staff .tlining are necessary to prevent on-line au'ts., The Rank Xeros 2400 xeroupllictor numinait tre brrier between copylng ud duplcating.

All bought-out items are inspected when delivered to the factory. A standards room with high- precision measuring equipment, capable of measuring down to one hundred thousandth of an inch, provides adequate measur- ing facilities to ensure that all the copiers manufactured meet the increasing accuracy required. Special surface tables weighing five tons, ground from American granite and optical profile pro- jectors are just some of the in-,, struments. used* which go to wards ensuring that Radk'Xerox copiers come from the factory fully checked.

Xerox. markets Tens of mil0ons of cpiora month are aread b ae on Rank Xerox xer, upA tor and the ndmber of Installations and copies is increasing rapidly. The first machine to become available was the 420, and this is already in use throughout Rank Xerox markets. .what effect,' i practice does a xeroduplicator have on the office work of companies that install them? Will their impact be as great asthe original impact of xerography on copying? Xeroduplicatin is, of course, still very new. 'Eme Companies, both in Bria and overseas, co-operated in field tests, but in most cases the users have only had their machines for two or three months: nevertheless, some interesting information is already being gathered, and the general lines on which most companies are proceeding are becoming clear. Longer Runs In most cases the decision to install the machine is taken for straightforward and. obvious reasons-to handle the work that has formerly been in the \" no- man's-land\" between copying and duplicating. Every user, of course, decides for himself ex- actly how far this ,\" no-man's. land\" extends in his own par- ticular set of circumstances-the availability of other duplicating machines,, their location in the building, the degree of skill of their operators, the work-load, and so on. As a rule of thumb, many users automatically allocate to the 420 all general duplicating up to about 25 copies. The 420 is used for lon1 r runs if the copies are requird in a hurry and, the master- aking facilities roe too Slow or OVer-loaded, or ,where ,sta , i o0h0r, ,or where ,The . n -I:. , I;,er u.t.- P flotfif)il o fdÂ«Â»N i '1 \"musteijus. tpie*^ thi- mi~eansi nq l th at snot necessary.to wail whilre sitencil or master ismade; bau ao that it now becoies practicabTe to re produce from a much wider range of documents, Evry docu- ment, in the office becomes a potential duplicating master. Further Copies Just as the artificial barrier be- tween copying and duplicating is removed, so is the distinction between what is available in the form of a master and what is available in the form of an original document. The xero- duplicates themselves are repro- ducible, so further copies can be iaken even when the original is not available. What this all adds up to is a more direct relationship, between the original and the duplicates, uncomplicated by the need to create, store and retrieve any intermediate stencil or master. Stage three, after the general work has been assimilated and the liberating effects of master less duplicating have been appre ciated, comes the origination of new business methods and sys- tems to take full advantage of the capabilities of the xerodupli- cator to handle particular jobs. These are some specific ex amples drawn from the many overseas users of the 420: In Switzeland. Nestl6 use a 420 in their head office reproduc tion service, alongside a Rank Xerox -914 copier. The 420 handles the work formerly done by five stencil duplicators, and at the same time has relieved peak loads on the 914 and on their small offset presses. The Woird Health Orag..si \"tm in Geneva have added a 420 ,o their other duplicatitg acili. e and the ct that they inade jnÃ½ go;'i~&fx tonmds a peaVk for itself. Also i \"Oneva, IbnVeeroni Ove S- -icews made .more than 100,000 copies within four months of installing the machine, which has replaced their former stencil and spirit methqd. In most companies duplicating is left to trained staff workin- in a special department, and xeroduplicating fits very easily into this pattern. But becau-s of its simplicity, it also lends itself well to a \"self-service\" system such as that used by -rocte Mad Ganble in Brosel They were already users of the 914 copier, and now use the 420 to make from 5 to 35 copies o any original document. In a self-service context such as this the fact that xeroduplicates are dry and ready for immediate use when they emerge from the machines is particularly valuable. The \"customer\" simply collect_ the copies from the tray and returns to her own department: ihere is no risk of smudging or offsetting. The .JB.M. Laboratories in Vienna develop and analyse scientific computer programmes for the solution of specific prob lems. In this work they need to have a fast and efficient method of duplicating computer output and .in the past they combined the use of a 914 copier (to handle the most urgent work) and stencil and spirit for the remainder where the saving in cost was more important than the saving of time. All this work is now handnddby one 420, giving faster servic saving clercal time and cutting costs. Pr ing Systems The i production of output rom dat procesing systems is a (prob e, faced by many cO.

They also find th- ly 420 particularly useful for issu- e ing quick addenda to their price s lists and for producing. 30-50 \"copies of 'circular letters for y suening to groups of customers. . They favour the 420 for the-e Sjobs because of the time and 0 cost saved through not havini f to make masters or stencils. a . r Two Examples s The Tnborg Breweries in Den- \" mark use two 914 copiers and Shave now added a 420 to dupli- cate reports and accounting documents whenever five or.

This peg-board aute Â·, atically ensures that several different documents bearing the equired information are ac- curately juxtaposed on the copy- ing glass, so that all the informn tion is correctly positioned on the copy. Four people were formnrly needed to produce the invoices by typing: Spaba now find that the xeroduplicating system has cut out the errors which used to arise in transcrip tion and the system is handled ;asily by two people. SAn example of a different Smethod of combined variable and fixed information comes \"rom FAEMA, the Italian manu- faturers of coffee machines. They take full advantage of the 420's ability to print variable information on to pre-printed forms. Faema sell their coffee Sm-achines on a hire-purchase system involving 24 or 36 pay- ments: the necessary documents are produced by typing& the details of the transaction-e.g., invoice number, amount of the instalment, the customer's name and address-and copying this on the 420, which is loaded with the pre-printed blank \"cam- .iale' (payment demands) fornms. .

Stanley Motors, who have 24 sales and service branches, use a 420 in their Head Office to do all the. short-run work formerly handled by stencil or spirit. Their repro* duction service has been speeded up and typists and duplicator operators have been released for other work. Higher Quality The general copying and duplicating work includes copies of letters, affidavits, branch in- structions and branch statistical returns. The use of carbon paper has almost disappeared. A leading stores group with headquarters in Sydney use the 420 for making up to 25 copies. Compared with their former spirit method, they find that the -eroduplicator gives them faster, higher-quality reproduction.

U.K.) seemed to clinch it-up to half-a-dozen or more exact copies of a typewritten top copy could be made in one go. It is still the commonest copying device for documents. How then is one to account for the copying explosion of the last decade or so? Machines are in use in the U.K. worth many millions-leasing and renting arrangements pre- clude an exact estimate-from the tery cheapest at. say, Â£25 to the machine that costs thousands. Paner, specialised to suit the machines, is being sold at probably Â£40m. a year here. The machines and the paper can be multiplied by five for the U.S. market. The whole industry has a 15 per cent. growth rate. Several Factors There are, it seems, several contributory factors that have led to this multi-million phenomenon-for that is what it is. First, the typewriter has limitations; it cannot draw; it cannot make straight lines for columnation. The copies get progressively less legible and fainter. Above all, a typist is needed and she is an expensive item in the chain of events, and she is far from infallible. What A new mobile showroom, specially built to Rank Xerox speifcation, is currently toring Britain. Into the show- room are ftted two of the company's xeroduplieators (the 420 seen here) and the desk-top 330. They will be demonstrated to interested customers up and down the country.

Preferably it would work from any master, whether handwritten or printed on the page of a book or newspaper or any other publication. And it had to operate cheaply enough, and *fast-the slowness of the normal method of producing docu- mentation did not suit the increased pace of modern business. One form of copying did get into the picture quite early-the use of a typed or written wax stencil, through which ink could be pressed by a roller. The names of Ellams, Gestetner, Roneo, come quickly to mind. From a master stencil hundreds of copies could be made very cheaply at a fraction of a penny. per copy. But this method still retained many of the limitations of the typewriter. It is true that a skilled worker with a stylus could contrive lines and draw- ings to a certain extent, but this is an expensive time-consuming affair and it denies the very purpose of the duplicator-the quick production of cheap facsimiles. The duplicator does this very effectively; and the duplicator business has enjoyed a %reat expansion, a remarkable aid to business and institutional documentation. There are many occasions, however, on which long runs of copies are not needed, and a short run on a duplicator is no cheaper than making carbon copies. With the moder de. mand to \" put everything in writ- ing\" there was a need for a different sort of copier, and many large companies were not slow to see that an immense harvest of sales plums was ripe for the picking. Out of the efforts have come a range and variety of photocopiers, so called because they depend on light for their operation. A photocopier must by its action obviously pro- duce perfect facsimiles, whether the original is drawing, photo- graph, print, typescript or hand- writing, whether it is columnated, tabulated or spatially distributed irt any other way. Reflex Technique Two techniques were available. One was photography, giving, of course,, excellent reproductions, but involving the use of dark. room, developers and the like. It was far too slow and Iqcon- venient for office copying. But by using the reflex technique, wherein the light goes through the sensitised paper to the docu. .iiet to be copied and is re lected back, producing a nega- tive, and using a modified de- velopment . (stabilisation and activation) process when the negative is used as the master, some companies have ;produced copying machines based largely on normal photographic proce dures. Tracing Cloth Another technique available was in use in engineering offices for the accurate reproduction of scaled drawings of devices, cir- cuits and so on made on.very large sheets of tracing cloth.. It was the diazo or. dyeline process, very similar to the reflex photo- graphic copier except that diazo salts were used instead of silver.. Arrangements had to be incor porated in the machine to de- velop the latent image. Ilford was the pioneer a dozen or so years ago in modifying this pro- cess for business use, It has the outstanding merit of having the lowest cost per copy, though the machines by comparison with some others,are expensive. In most of them, as with photo- reflex methods, the print comes out wet or damp. At the same time as these methods were being developed for copying, other concerns were developing more novel methods as well. In normal photography, as everyone knows, light must pass through 'a negative to the paper that is to produce the desired positive. But reverse transfer of the image can also be done by diffusion when the \"positive\" emulsion is in moist contact with the \"negative\" in the presence of suitable chemicals. Such a diffusion transfer is the basis of the Polaroid system of getting \"instant\" positives. The same principle has been developed in Europe and the resulting diffusion-transfer copying mach' ines are the cheapest to buy, though the cost per copy is corn paratively high, and are the best- sellers in the market. Kodak has meanwhile made its unique Verifax photographic system Involving a direct con- tact transfer of gelatine from the \" master \" (or negative). The Minnesota Mining and Mach- inery Company has developed a process (Thermofax) relying on radiant heat as its \"light\" and bringing up the image on beat. sensitive paper. A perfectly dry copy emerges in a couple of seconds; Eichrer Drycopy has successfully contended the patent,rights as.ar, as . urf p is edncerned, None of these systems pro, duces perfect copies in, ever sense. They are at once detected as copies, though this for much work is uniAportant. Naturally however, in a competitive world still other cbncerns have tried what they believe are better techniques, and the copiers' world was shake when the Xerox Corporation showed its new so-called xerographic pro. cess. And when not long after- wards the Rank Corporation joined with Xerox to form Rank Xerox for the.,manufac- ture and sale outside the Americas and Japad, the com- petitive heat was really on. Special Paper Xerography is an electrostatic process whereby a pattern of electric charges is produced on selenium, 'the pattern corres- ponding to that on the illu- minated master. Oppositely charged graphite powder flies to the pattern, which is transferred to paper and then fused on by heat. The result is a clean, ever- lasting copy of remarkable quality, failing, in comparison with photography, only 'in its inability to reproduce half-tone pictures. Other large companies have been qtick to take up the chal- lenge with direct electrostatic methods needing special paper coated with zinc oxide. Addressograph-Multigraph, Oza- lid, Smith Corona Marchant, Apeco, Savin, Business Machines-all are challenging. It would take a treatise to make detailed comparisons between all the methods, for each has advantages and dis- advantages in capital cost, run- ning costs, quality of result, speed, size of paper, mechanical arrangements, ease of operation (push-button control, etc.) by unskilled personnel, the need for , special paper, and so on. And all are limited to small runs by the nature of the process, the cost, or the speed. Photocopiers have remained separate from the duplicators and anyone wanting good copies and long runs had to use both types of machine. Optical System That is to say, until recently. Rank-Xerox again caused a sensation by producing a xero- graphic machine fast enough to act economically as a duplicator, though without the need for a special master as required by all other duplicators. It was the 2400, producing 2,400 copies an hour. The speeds of all other copiers (with the exception of one specialised dyeline machine) ranges from 90 copies an hour in the slowest to 1,800 in the fastest. The new Rank Xerox machine thus makes duplicating and photocopying of high quality, from any type of original and without the need for a specially prepared master, possibl in one device This has been achieved by five years of developlrnt involving a new optical\" stem, sideways' feeding of the ' psper on the drum, speed-up of the \"drum and greatly increased light power. It bridges a gap and brings some- thing new to the copying industry. Let no one foubt that the company's competitors are well aware of this and have not been idle.",
