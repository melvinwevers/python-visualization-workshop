   "text_content" : "TOYOTA, the Japanese carmaker, has proposed an agreement which some union leaders regard as a no-strike deal for workers at its new British plant. Toyota also wants to delay pay talks until at least 1994 aftersigning a sin- gle union agreement, writes John Gapper. Toyota's proposals, con- tained in a confidential 50-page draft deal, have alarmed some union leaders competing for one of the most highly prized single union deals since Nissan started production in Tyne and Wear in 1986. The company is seeking a standard 39-hoir fve-day week when production starts in Bur- naston, Derbyshire in 1992. It also wants to be able to roster workers for up to an extra two hours a day and on alternate Saturday mornpings if required. The most controversial pro.- posal is for a \"no disruption\" deal under which pay and working practices disputes would be resolved by binding arbitration at the Acas concili- ation service if they could not be resolved by negotiation. This has worried officials cf unions including the \"GWU transport union and the MSS: general technical union because they have taken a firm stance against \"no strike\" agreements of the type pio- neered by the EETPU electri- clans' union. The Trades Union Congress in Glasgow will today discuss a controversial motion put by NSS which criticises Japanese companies for \"bringing alien worling; practices with them\" to Britain and criticises estab- lished single union deals. Another controversial Toyota proposal is for pay talks to be delayed until at least April 1994 after an initial pay settlement. This would delay a 37-hour week in Toyota until at least 1995. Some union officials are also worried by a clause which would allow the company to lay off white collar staff with- out pay on a month's notice. Currently, only blue collar workers can be laid off without pay in the rest of the British car industry.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephen* and Allson Smith A CONSERVATIVE lead of 4.5 percentage points in the latest opinion poll yesterday height- ened the outbreak of general election fever despite an attempt by Mr John Major to cool speculation. The prime minister, how- ever, refused to rule out entirely the possibility of a poll this year. The survey, by Gallup in today's Daily Telegraph, shows the Tories on 39.5 per cent, Labour on 35 per cent, the Lib- eral Democrats on 19.5 per cent, and other parties with a total of 6 per cent. A similar poll last month gave Labour a 5 percentage point lead, over the Tories' 36 per cent. The Liberal Demo- crats have improved their showing by 3 points. The poll was taken before Wednesday's half a percentage point cut in interest rates which fuelled the current bout of election speculation. It is the first time since before Mr Major became prime minister that Labour's support has fallen from about 40 per cent, but the figures did not weaken the opposition's call for an early election. Speaking in Hong Kong at the end of a three-nation tour which had also taken him to Beijing and Moscow, Mr Major repeated his determination to conclude over the next few months agreements with Britain's European partners on economic and political union. Those deals are due to be struck at the European Com- munity summit in December Major pledge falls to satisfy Hong Kong leaders.....Page 4 Joe Rogaly: May Is the best bet........................... Page 15 and negotiations would be dis- rupted by a general election. Referring to the speculation about election timing, he added: \"I think that specula- tion like that at this stage of a parliament is always inevita- ble. I just hope that not too many people will take that almost inevitable day-to-day speculation too seriously. We still have work to do\". Senior aides travelling with the prime minister said that the timing of the interest rate cut had been dictated by the fall in inflation and by favoura- ble market conditions and not by any strategy to engineer an early general election. They added that while Mr Major had been encouraged by the improvement in the Con- servatives' fortunes in the most recent Mori poll last weekend, which showed a Tory lead of 2 percentage points, he was far too cautious to regard that as an opportunity to seek a fresh mandate this year rather than next. Over the last few months the polls have been extremely vola- tile and Mr Major is aware that the boost to the Conservatives' standing provided by his high international profile in recent weeks might not be sustained in an election campaign. The economy is expected to Continued on Page 16 I Major cool on early poll contnd s.o P. . dominate the campign and Mr Maor's view is that although the recession has ended, a deci- sive upturn may not be appar- eat for five or six months. The aides, however, added that Mr Mar was determined not to be drawn publicly into ruling out eniry any particu- lar date for the ection. It - and thiere is no expecta tion t would happen - s t for the Lbour party then he would obluly e bempted to Nae the opportunity of an election I Â· this year rather than next Iabour said the Galup sur- -y further emphasised recent polls' volatility, and contrasted it with one just three weeks ago which showed the party with a 9 percentage point lead Indeed, the larger monthly Gallp poll carried out among 11,000 voters throughout August still gives Labour a sight lead over the Tori with tahe 3rties oP 3 an MS per aent rmspectively. Mr Roy Hattersley, labours deputy limier, salt: VFr the last three weeks as John Major has toured the world he has not been asked a single ques tion about the state of the Brit- ish economy, the British health service or the education sys- tem.

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in Washington and Richard Waters in London THE US yesterday indicted six officials of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), along with a leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel in Colombia and Capcom Sinan- cial Services Ltd of London on charges of racketeering and laundering millions of dollars of drug money through BCCL Among those indicted was Mr Syed Ali Akbar, former BCCI treasurer and former head of Capcom, who was arrested by French customs earlier this week as he arrived in Calais. The US Justice Department said it had asked France to extradite Mr Akbar to the US to stand trial. Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the BCCI president who was first charged in New York last July, w-as listed as another of the 12 defendants in yesterday's indictments. The Justice Department has not asked Abu Dhabi to extradite Mr Naqvi because of \"technicalities\". The charges included the ~ueged me by Mr Akber and O atof Capcom in the UK to Abu Dhabi amma body to oaider relaunch.......Page 7 hide and transfer $23m (Â£13.6m) of funds controlled by Mr Manuel Noriega, the former Panamanian dictator, who went on trial in Miami on drug charges yesterday. Also indicted in the BCCI case was Mr Gerardo \"Don chepe\" Moncada, a leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, and four of his associates. They are accused of using the bank's network between 196 and 1969 to launder more than $l4m of drug proceeds. Mr Robert Mueller, assistant attorney general of the US, said the latest BCCI indict -ants had been deliverd by ra jury in Tampa in wi 5frm on August 3 and ktn scret until yesterday in order to seek the arrests. Mr Akbar, however, is the only defendant thus far a-rested. Mr Mueller said Wa as gtor lud been working- with Scotland Yard and the Serious Fraud Office in London to seek the arrest of Mr Dildar Rizvi, a former BCCI treasurer, also charged yesterday. \"We had reason to believe Mr Rizvi was in England, but our efforts to arrest him have been unsuc- cessful,\" Mr Mueller said. In London last night, Mr Michael Barrett, a Capcom director, said. \"We were named in the earlier indictment in Tampa, but that was never fol- lowed up on.\" Mr Akbar was sentenced in the UK last Octo- ber to 18 months imprisonment for drug money laundering. He was released this year on ball, one of the terms being resi- dence at a UK address. Mr Akbar, in an interview with the Financial Times last month, claimed to have been made the scapegoat for failings at BCCI, and denied involve- ment in money laundering.

Instead, it was money intended for a property development by the Tawfik brothers who run the El Rayan Investment Group in Egypt, he said. According to yesterday's indictment, Mr Naqvi and Mr Rizvi attended a meeting in London in early 1988 at which \"they discussed transferring approximately $23m in deposits at BCCI London, owned by Mr Noriega and family, to BCCI Luxembourg to allay Noriega's fear of asset seizure by US offi- cials\". The money was later moved at their direction from SLuxembourg to accounts at several other banks, and found its way through Finley Interna- tional to Capcom, it is claimed. Yesterday's BCCI indict- ments, the second set in the US since the bank was shut down on July 5, were unveiled as a Congressional report claimed US federal officials had failed to pursue investigations of BCCI and had missed an oppor- tunity to stop the bank's illegal activities despite having had information of BCCI impropri- eties as far back as 1983. Mr Charles Schumer, a Dem- ocratic congressman from New York, released a detailed report on BCCI and said that in 1983 \"law enforcement ... had details of BCCI's shenanigans\".",

   "text_content" : "Tavin dinown th nlaw! vesterdav securea aDoroval ior iransunonai DC as or power By John Lloyd and Anthony Robinson in Moscow THE SOVIET Union's Congress of People's Deputies, the top Soviet lawmaking body, voted yesterday to dissolve itself, ushering in transitional bodies of power and giving constitu- tional approval to a new Soviet era. The transitional bodies will give the republics responsibil- ity for maintaining - or destroying - what is left of the Union. Agreement to end the con- gress's three-year life came grudgingly after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet presi- dent and chairman of the ses- sion, threatened to send the deputies home if they did not vote through a controversial clause in the law establishing the new structures. This lays down the size of the republics' representation in the revamped Supreme Soviet, the new top legislative body. The vote ensured a relatively rapid passage of the rest of the laws. It has also allowed Mr Gorbachev a political life after the failed coup and the end of the Communist party, leaving him at the head of a loose con- federation of republics. The result of the vote, said Mr Sergei Stankevich, former deputy mayor of Moscow and now a Russian state councillor, was that the Union was \"half dead\". Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, chairman of the Russian Social iemocrats, said: \"At the end of the transitional period, either we will all be independent states or we will have some Kind of federation.\" The new bodies are a State Council, composed of the Soviet president and the lead- I Marching to new orders; Calm returns after bank's nightmarish week, Page 2 I Editorial Comment; Eastern approaches, Page 14 I Soviet food aid 'needs funding', Page 16 ers of the participating repub- lics - at present 10 of the 15, excluding the three Baltic states, Georgia and Moldova. An inter-republic economic committee, still to be formed, will absorb the old Union min- istries and attempt to organise an economic agreement. There will be a reformed Supreme Soviet, in which the upper house, or Council of the Republics, will contain 20 dep- uties from each republic - except Russia, which will have 52 representatives - and one deputy extra from each autono- mous republic or area. The State Council will hold its first meeting today, when the issue of independence for the Baltic states will be dis- cussed, according to Mr Boris Pankin, the Soviet foreign min- ister. Baltic leaders are confi- dent that their independence claims will be rubber-stamped. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the radical economist and member of the four-man committee cur- rently carrying on the func- tions of a Union government, said in a speech to the Swiss- based World Economic Forum in Moscow last night that the committee was preparing an agreement under which repub- lics could create their own cur- rencies and tax policies."

   "text_content" : "John Lloyd looks at the future for the Union's transitional bodies of power, now the People's Deputies have been bullied into acquiescence THE Congress of People's Deputies went into oblivion yesterday with- out much spirit, either of revolt or of joy, easily bullied into acquiescence by Mr Mik- hail Gorbachev, who has lost little of his skill. Though it voted to set up transitional bodies of power, it had been a transitional body itself - existing in the change- over from the centralised Soviet system, dominated by the Communist party, to the new era which now begins. Mr Sergei Stankevich, a Rus- sian state councillor, gra- ciously acknowledged that it was in the Congress that he and other democrats had received their early training as politicians. Yet \"I don't regret its passing,\" he said, \"indeed, I'm glad it's passed.\" The historically minded among the deputies recalled January 5 1918, when Lenin's Bolsheviks, frustrated by the impossibility of getting the Constituent. Assembly (the then parliament) to confirm their power, confirmed it them- selves by locking out (and later locking up) the recalcitrant deputies. Mr Gorbachev had made it clear that if the Congress did not vote for the new order, it would be decreed into place by himself: it did smack a little of Lenin. The new structures of power have yet to be created, but their most urgent tasks are obvious. First, the winter must be prepared for. As he came out of the hall yesterday, Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, the former prime minister, talked with forebod- ing of the coming months. The Soviet Union needs 100m tonnes of grain: so far, only 25m-27m tonnes have been gathered. \"We might get 40m - but where does the rest come from? From abroad - but where's the hard cur- rency?\" This is the prime task of all levels of government - inter- republican, republican, city and districts. Schoolchildren, students, army personnel, pensioners and other workers are being wooed out to the country to gather in the harvest. The farmers are being cajoled into selling with prom- ises of higher prices (some in hard currency) and machinery and consumer goods. Effecting these promises will need co-ordination. The machinery is made in one republic, but needed by many. It is not clear who will decide the priorities, nor whether inter-republican agreement can prevent the de facto creation of borders to stop republican pro- duce going elsewhere - a pro- cess which has already started. Second, an economic agreew ment must be signed. At least 10 of the republics agree on this - but their agreement is in principle, not on details. The version of such an agreement proposed by Prolf sor Stanlslav Shatalin pparently backed by Mr Ivan -ilayev, the Russian prime minister, who chairs the Com- mittee for Management of the Economy - though loose, enjoins common monetary pol icies and a single currency. At present, although the cen- tralised system is supposed to p-revail, it does not. Republic central banks give unres trained credit and some repub lics are planning to introduce their own currencies. In order to get an effective economic agreement, republics will have to give up \"free doms\" that they have already taken. Third, an agreement must be reached on a new Union treaty. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, Mr Gorbachev's close aide, said after the Congress that he believed such an agreement would be signed. Mr Stank evich believes the same: \"It is the rational thing for the republics to do, after an economic agreement is work- ing.\" Rational it may be, but there are forces other than rea- son at work. The republics have all declared independence and each of their parliaments will be considering any agreement. In this process, factors such as nationalist emotions and resentment against decades of Soviet/Russian rule are likely to come into play. The elites of the republics are also now facing the daz- zling prospect of having inde- pendent ministries, epart- ments and foreign embassies. In addition to this, they will also be adopting constitutions - which will take time. Only when this process is complete, and only if the economic facts of life then dictate to the republics that they need to pool sovereignty in order to survive, might they be in the mood for a new union.

   "text_content" : "Mr Boris Pankin: condemnation of coup attempt won him the Job of foreign minister By Leyla Boulton in Moscow THE first public appearance by Mr Boris Pankin, the Soviet foreign minister, yesterday coincided with the birth of a new Soviet Union. Mr Pankin, who looks at least a decade younger than his 60 years, said that from now on foreign policy would be determined jointly with the republics forming the new-look union approved by the Soviet super-parliament yesterday. \"The foreign ministry... will undergo certain changes,\" he said. \"We will work in organic contact with the... states which join our union.\" Mr Penkin, a former editor of the Communist newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, was until last week Soviet ambassa- dor to Prague. But his immedi- ate condemnation of the coup launched by senior govern- ment ministers on Monday August 19 won him the job of foreign minister to replace Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, who was accused of being too quiet that day. Mr Pankin said the defeat of the abortive coup was not only a victory for the people and the Russian leaders who resisted the putsch, but a victory for \"international solidarity\". Given the radical change in the job description since the coup collapsed and the discred- ited old centre was forced to cede political supremacy to the republics, it seems quite fitting that a new man, of obvious cal- ibre, should fill the job. Although he was wearing a smart, almost flamboyant, dou- ble-breasted suit, his manner conveyed an opposite message of soft-spoken modesty and caution. His answers were clear and to the point. He politely side- tracked questions he could not answer. When asked how the Soviet Union's Middle East pol- icies would be affected by the changes, he said the question was good but went into a lengthy explanation of how policy would have to be worked out with the new sov- ereign Soviet states. He said he looked forward to meeting Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, next week but declined to say whether he would be seeking economic assistance."

   "text_content" : "By John Uoyd in Moscow MARSHAL Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the new defence minister, yesterday again sought to reassure world opinion that the rapid drain of power away from the central government in the Soviet Union did not mean a loss of control over the Soviet nuclear forces. \"Nuclear weapons are under secure control. Even during the putsch, they were not accessible to anyone. Now, we have increased control over them many times. I ask you [the media] to calm down a world public,\" he said. The minister gave no details, however, either of the control of the nuclear trigger during the coup, or of the increased control since. He also said the Soviet mill- tary was moving in the direc- tion of a professional army, though it was not yet ready to give up the draft. Repeating his promise to shorten the two-year term of conscription Marslal Shaposh- nlkov said that conscripts would be offered a contract for further service of three to five years as professional soldiers, at full rates of pay, provided they were willing to serve any- where in the Soviet Union. This condition appears to mean that enlisted recruits will be allowed to serve in their own republics, which was one of the demands of some republican leaders before the coup. The minister hoped that relationships with the west would be \"widened and deep- ened\", and admitted that he \"had a dream\" that Junior offI- cers and ordinary soldiers, as well as senior ofmers, would participate in exchange visits with western countries. He had \"takes an oath to himself\" that the armed forees would never be used against the people while he was minis- ter. They would not guard republican borders, or inter- fere in the internal affairs of any republics, and would only guard installations at the express request of republican authorities. The military would lease its land and hire out its trucks to earn money for its upkeep, he said. The \"special depart- mants\" in the army, in which secret service agents kept watch on the soldie, would be removed in consultation with Mr Vadim Bakatin, new chairman of the KGB.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "SMBARRASSED politi- cians in Sweden and the UK are playing for time in the face of increasing pres- sure by the Baltic states for the return of gold they had on deposit in western banks in i940 at the time of the Soviet takeover. Their embarrassment is heightened by the fact that France already has given back gold claimed by the Baltics and the US has indicated it will probably do the same. Unlike Britain and Sweden, the US did not hand the pre- cious metal over to the Soviet Union but used it to keep the legations and consulates of the three Baltic states in New York and Washington. While the amounts involved are tiny in gold market terms, the value to the three coun- tries is enormous because the metal would provide credibility when they relaunch their own currencies. Most of the Baltic gold, nearly 14 tonnes of it with a value today of about $146m (Â£86.3m), was in the UK. France returned 3.2 tonnes of gold, worth about $36m at today's price; about three tonnes were held in Sweden and are now worth $33.5m. In the US the Baltic gold was placed under the control of the Office of Frozen Foreign Assets which said yesterday it was unable to provide details of the original amount or how much was left but was \"working on it\". Howevrer, the Bank of Estonia suggests that it depos- ited about 4 tonnes of gold -- now worth $45m - in the US. The issue is reviving some painful memories in Sweden because it was the second country - after Nazi Germany - to recognise the Soviet regime occupying its Baltic Kenneth Gooding reports on an issue embarrassing the UK and Sweden neighbours. The Baltic gold was handed over to the Soviet Union in May 1941 as part of that recognition process in the expectation that Sweden would then regain control of its assets in the conquered countries. Under the Wilson govern- ment Britain sold the Baltic gold in 1967 for Â£5.8m to settle some of the debts it claimed were due from the Soviet Union and distributed the pro- ceeds to claimants in the UK and overseas. Sir Frederick Bennett, vice-president of the Baltic Council of the UK, says mem- bers of all UK political parties regarded this \"as a very shady deal\". The gold was held in trust, he says. \"I don't doubt we did something which we knew was wrong and we did it because we never expected to be held to account because the then com- monly held view was that the Baltic states would never exist again.\" The Baltic states are taking every diplomatic opportunity to make their point. Mr Lennart Meri, the Esto- nian foreign minister, raised the subject in Stockholm last week when he held talks with his Swedish counterpart, Mr Sten Andersson, on restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries. This week Mr Douglas Hogg, the UK's foreign office minister leading the first British diplo- matic delegation to Lithuania for more than 50 years, was also pressed hard about the gold but remained evasive. \"We haven't any firm propos- als but we want to be construc- tive,\" he said. He suggested that, when Lithuania sends a technical team to London soon, it should discuss the gold question with the UK government's legal advisers \"to see if we can find a solution which is acceptable to Lithuania and ourselves\". Such prevarication will not satisfy UK supporters of the Baltic states who intend to put as much moral and political pressure as possible on the Foreign Office to have gold returned as compensation in the shortest possible time.",

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington THE US is seeking high-level assurances from the Soviet Union that the new leadership will honour repayment of the country's $2bn (Â£37bn) exter- nal debt. Concern about the disinte- ration of central authority in the Soviet Union has raised fears in Washington that the increasingly powerful repub- lc could be tempted into repu- diating or imposing a morato- riium on debt repayments. These worries have been compounded by what one senior US official described yesterday as a \"severe liquidity criis\" in the Soviet Union. The lack of hard currency is aready forcing the authorities in Moscow to cut back on bad- ly-needed imports and build up further arrears on repayment of its existing debt. Although the Bush adminis- tration has not received a dear simnal from Moscow that a debt moratorium is being contem- plated, officials watching the Soviet Union have been alarmed at the failure of the new leadership to \"indicate and act\" on the country's inter- national liabilities. A debt moratorium is viewed in Washington as a potentially disastrous move, jeopardising the Soviet Union's future abil- ity to borrow and thereby mak- ing it much more diicult to aree ao a comnrelesive eco- nomic reform programme for the country. One option to restore confi- dence would be for the Soviet leadership to pledge some of the country's gold reserves or at least to take urgent steps to boost the country's foreign exchange earnings through the sale of oil, energy or precious stones, according to one view in the administration. Senior US oflcials are wor- ried that the new Soviet leader- ship's preoccupation with polit- ical questions relating to the new power-sharing arrange- ments between Moscow and the republics has obscured urgent practical problems fc- ingthe economy.",

   "text_content" : "PRESIDENT Mllkhail Gorbachev has endorsed a presidential decree recognising Baltic independence, according to a Lithuanian official who helped draft the decree along with other Baltic representatives, Gillian Tett reports from Vilnius. Speaking on his return to Vilnius from Moscow, Mr Algis Cekuolls, Lithuanian observer at the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, said Mr Gorbachev had asked the Baltic observers to draft a presidential decree recognising their Independence. After some modification from Mr Alexander Yakovlev, adviser to Mr Gorbachev, the president then endorsed it, Mr Ceknolls said. Mr Boris Pankin, the new Soviet foreign minister, said yesterday that the State Council, the country's main new decision-making body, would discuss the issue of Baltic independence today, but he would not predict the outcome. According to an early version of the document, leaked yesterday to the Lithuanian parliament, the decree condemns the 1939-40 Soviet annexation of the Baltics as illegal and recognises the Independence of the three Baltic states \"under international law\". It also accepts existing Baltic borders as inviolable and calls for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to establish diplomatic relations with the three Baltic republics. The document was initially greeted with scepticism from Lithuanian officials. But Mr Cekuolis insisted Mr Gorbachev was prepared to endorse the decree. He said the president had delayed decisively settling the issue at the Congress because he feared the decree would be blocked by conservative -eputies. Even if he issues a decree, few Lithuanians expect the political and legal details of full ndependence to be settled soon. As the old central government structures dissolve there s doubt about which bodies have the authorit3 to implement Baltic independence, or what weight a decree now carries. Lithuanian leaders say they will not accept a presidential decree that simply recognises their independence without providing a guarantee and timetable for withdrawal of Soviet troops."

   "text_content" : "By Robert Thomson in Tokyo JAPAN will soon announce plans to establish about 50 local committees responsible for processing applications by Japanese and foreign compa- nies wanting to open large retail outlets. The Japanese government has been under pressure from Washington to speed the pro- cessing of such applications, which are often opposed by local retailers and, in the past, have been delayed for 10 years or more. Under present regula- tions, new applications must be processed within 18 months. Washington believes an increase in development of larger outlets will give foreign retailers greater access to the Japanese market and create more shelf space in Japanese outlets for foreign products and a revised law, likely to be introduced early next year, will reduce that limit to 12 months. But the US has been concerned that local authorities could still obstruct applications from \"outsiders\", either foreign com- panies or Japanese companies based outside the local area. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) has apparently decided to establish the committees to examine applications and negotiate with local retailers on the size and type of new complexes. Each of the committees will have seven representatives, including scholars, lawyers and other respected members of the local communities, and they will be expected to make the final decision on the timing of new stores. A Miti official said local retailers would not be appointed to the commit- tees, which would be \"indepen- dent\". Small retailers are a power- ful lobby group in Japan and continue to oppose the revision of the store law. The govern- ment is planning to allocate increased funds to the retailers to allow them to renovate local shopping centres and make themselves more competitive, but further friction is inevita- ble. The US retailer Toys R Us has already caused a stir with plans for a chain of toy stores, which have been strongly opposed by smaller retailers. And in Hiroshima, in the west of Japan, local retail groups have called for extra govern- ment compensation even though no new proposals for stores have been submitted in the past year.",

   "text_content" : "A SCIENIST at Britain's SChemical and Biologi- A cal Defence Establish ment (CBDE) at Porton Down in Wiltshire waves a small bot- tle of cloudy liquid. It contains micro-organisms used to simu- late Prancisella tularensis, a bactertim which causes a dis- ease called tularemia. It is usu- ally spread by rodents but could be sprayed as a weapon. In that bottle, he says, there would be enough minute parti- cles to infect every person on the planet. The threat of biological war- nre, the subject of an interna- tional conference starting in Geneva next week, has been underlined by the recent UN inspection of facilities in Iraq, where substances including tularemia bacteria were found. It is the potency of biological agents that causes the most alarm and the most attraction for potential producers. Despite allegations, there have been no substantiated cases of biologi- cal arms being used, and there is little information about which countries have them. But about 10 are believed either to possess or to be seeK- ing to acquire them. \"Unless we take action at the review conference, that number will go on increasing,\" warns Dr Graham Pearson, CBDE direc- lor-general. It will be the third review of the Biological Weapons Con- vention signed in 1972 and will focus on ways of tightening the ban on production. A CBDE expert, Dr David Snectrum of chmlal and bioloical warfare Kelly, headed the UN team that went last month to inspect the bombed Iraqi complex at Salman Pak, south of Baghdad. The Iraqis said they had under taken research on the micro-or- ganisms that produce botu- 1ism, gas gangrene and anthrax. No actual weapons or weap- on-making equipment were ound. But Dr Kelly says key failities were removed shortly before the team arrived. \"It became quite obvious they were undertaking research for offensive purposes,\" he says. Additional substances includ- ing brucellosis bacteria were found. Another inspection is due to be made shortly. Experts are concerned that countries with chemical weap ons may be moving to biologi- cal weapons. As microbiology advances, more nations will become capable of doing so. Biological warfare is defined as the dissemination of micro- organisms to carry lethal or incapacitating diseases, or to destroy domestic animals or food crops. The term is used to cover both biological agents able to reproduce themselves and toxins or poisons. The 1925 Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons also banned \"bacterio- logical methods of warfare\". The 1972 convention went fur ther to forbid development, production or stockpiling of biological or toxin weapons. But it did not address the pos- session of production facilities and made no provision for checking on compliance. The potential threat ranges from common viruses and bac- teria such as mumps, chicken- pox, cholera or typhoid, through more exotic ones such as dengue fever, for which there is no specific therapy, to new products of genetic engi- neering. With new substances, the distinction between chemical and biological weapons is becoming less clear. One prob- lem in policing a ban is that only small quantities are required. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, substances such as black widow spider venom or strychnine require a smaller lethal dose than first world war chemical gases such as chlorine and phosgene. Oth ers such as botulinus toxin, anthrax or plague are several thousand times more toxic than modem nerve gases. Of most concern are aerosol weapons, spraying small parti- cles that can penetrate the lungs. Experts say these have more obvious military use than, for instance, trying to poison water supplies, which even with a potent toxin, would require large amounts to have lethal effect. Sprayed, a small amount could cover hun- dreds of square miles. How- ever, aerosol agents must be stable in storage and resilient. Anthrax, once known as \"wool-sorters' disease\", is exceptionally resistant and therefore favoured as a poten- tial weapon. Britain carried out an anthrax experiment in the second world war on Gruinard Island off Scotland, and public access remained prohibited until last year. The Soviet Union is considered never to have provided a satisfactory explanation for an anthrax out- break at Sverdlovsk in the Urals in 1979. In the Gulf con- flict, both US and British troops were vaccinated against the disease. Western countries have been discussing the introduction of new confidence-building mea- sures at the Geneva confer- ence. The UK wants to extend the requirement for countries to declare some categories of laboratory, including civilian facilities working on the most hazardous micro-organisms. An exlerts' meeting in 1987 called for declarations, but so far only about 40 of 117 signa- tories to the convention have complied. Measures are also being sought against prolifera- tion, but proposals for monitor- ing exports are expected to meet resistance from some non-aligned countries. One of the main challenges is finding ways of preserving \"defensive\" research such as the CBDE carries out, includ- ing vaccines, while strengthen- ing the ban on weapon-making processes. Part of the work is the same in both cases. The UK is proposing an experts' group to look at the scope for inspec- tion of declared and suspect facilities and investigation of incidents such as Sverdlovsk. But a UK official warns: \"It will not be easy, and indeed may not in the end be possible to devise an effective verifica- tion regime.\" But Dr Pearson at the CBDE hopes a combination of verifi- cation measures, export con- trols and defensive precautions can create a \"web of deter- rence\"."

   "text_content" : "MR Carl Bildt, Sweden's Moderate party leader, is increasingly likely to be his country's next prime minister, Robert Taylor reports from Stockholm. With only 10 days to go before Sweden's general election on September 15, his self-confidence was boosted yesterday by the latest opinion poll, which suggests the non- socialist parties will win with 58 per cent of the vote between them. \"I don't want to suggest we will win,\" Mr Bildt cautioned in an interview. \"There is still some way to go.\" But barring an upset, he is set to head a four-party non-socialist coali- tion government later this month, a prospect many Swedes find hard to believe, such has been the Social Demo- cratic domination for nearly 60 years. But the national mood has been transformed over the past three years in a way that makes Mr Bildt's election pos- sible. Sweden is moving towards the free market as it converges with the EC, which it hopes to join at end-1994. All main parties agree on the need to deregulate and liberalise the economy, differing merely on the pace of reform. The ruling Social Democrats have responded to the change in mood, but \"they have no ideol- ogy and no policies, now,\" Mr Bildt claims. \"They don't really understand the market econ- omy and why socialism has failed.\" Yet more than an element of doubt remains about Mr Bildt, who must still convince Swe- den's many undecided voters he can stitch together a viable alternative government to the Social Democrats out of four non-socialist parties. The danger exists of an elec- toral deadlock after September 15. Recent opinion polls show a substantial non-socialist major ity among the Swedish elector- ate of about 60 per cent, but this is made up of support for up to five parties. One of them, New Democracy, is a new pop- ulist, right-wing party that questions such Swedish sacred cows as state welfare, foreign aid and tough laws against alcohol. Its irreverent style has offended the established non- socialist party leaders, espe- cially Mr Bengt Westerberg of the Liberals, who insists his party will not join a coalition that depends for its parliamen- tary survival on ND. But the polls suggest ND could hold the power balance after September 15. The Social Democrats hope that if so, Mr Westerberg will break loose from the non-socialist bloc and make a deal with them. The other non-socialist leaders are irritated at Mr Westerberg's threat, even if they too want to keep ND at arm's length. The Centre party also threat- ens to prove difficult. Mr Olof Johansson, its leader, may demand a high price for partic- ipation. The Christian Demo- crats, who look like being the election's real success story, winning seats in parliament for the first time, may prove more reliable coalition part- ners, though their leader, Mr Als Svensson, will be keen to emphasise the party's distinc- tive identity. Bringing these fragmented parties together will test Mr Bildt's political finesse. Carl Bildt: \"There is still some way to go\"",

A Commission official said the EC executive had been forced to delay a planned revamp of the so-called Gener- alised System of Preferences (GSP), due to have taken effect from the start of 1992, because the Gatt talks have yet to be wound up. Instead it is proposing that EC governments agree to a temporary extension of the GSP in its current form beyond the end of 1991 until it can be revised in the light of a Gatt agreement. The GSP grants preferential access through zero or reduced tariffs on imports of industrial and agricultural products, tex- tiles and steel from developing countries. Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria were added to the list of benefll- caries this year. The Uruguay Round of talks on the liberalising of world trade into the next century, which were scheduled to end last December, are likely to be extended to allow more time for settlement of a dispute between the Community and itstradi partners, in particu- lar the S, over the question of frm subsidies.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva PANOCO HOLDING, the Swiss-based parent company for the Pan Ocean oil group, yesterday announced the signing of a $600m (Â£355m) joint venture with Tatneft, the petroleum administration of Tatarstan, the Soviet Tatar autonomous republic. The local parliament of Tatarstan declared its independence in August last year. Yesterday Mr Shafatgat Takhautdi- nov, Tatneft's deputy director-general, Insisted that Tatarstan would receive the full benefit of its share of the 50-50 joint production and exploration agreement. \"Moscow will get nothing,\" he said. Under the Blue Kama venture - named after the river located to the immediate north of the production fields - Panoco and Tatneft will develop seven oilflelds in a 78,461-acre area with proven reserves of 1.69bn barrels of oil. Current production from the area is 2,000 barrels a day (b/d). Mr Vittorio di Guevara Fabbri, Panoco's chairman and chief executive, put the future target at 125,000 b/d. The venture provided for the drilling of over 2,000 wells over a 10-year period, using modern techniques including hori- zontal drilling and recovery enhancing technology. The first new output is expec- ted to come on stream early next year. In addition, Panoco will build a new 94km pipeline with a capacity of some 120,000 bid between the Blue Kama area and the oil treatment facilities at Alme- tyevsk. The final phase of the project foresees the construction of a 50,000 b/d refinery in the Nurlat area which, according to Panoco, will \"drastically improve the eco- nomic independence of the region\". Although it has long been one of the main oil-producing areas of the Soviet Union, Tatarstan has had no domestic refining capacity. Tatar oil has been exported at low prices to eastern Europe through the Druzhba pipeline. The republic's domestic needs have been met by the re-import of refined products from neighbouring republics. Mr Herbert Rooks, head of Panoco's Soviet operations, said discussions on the financing of the project were already well advanced with banks from several coun- tries. A European bank would probably head a financing consortium. Panoco is a secretive group which does not disclose the names of its owners. Mr di Guevara Fabbri said they comprised a group of private individuals; no big oil company had an interest.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Carneg in Jerusalem and Lonel Barber in Washington ISRAEL SAID yesterday it would press ahead with its request for big US loan guaran- tees, despite strong pressure from Washington to delay the issue to avoid disrupting plans to hold a Middle East peace conference next month. At the same time, US om- cials said President Bush was also seeking firmer commit- ments from the Israeli govern- ment to halt settlements in the occupied territories before granting the guarantees. Both Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, are worried that an early deci- sion to approve the loan guar- antees could.offer Arab parties an excuse to delay taking part in a Middle East peace confer- ence, tentatively set for next month. The battleground will be in the US Congress. If Israel seeks to use pro-Jewish sentiment to push through approval of the loan guarantees in this year's foreign aid appropriations bill, it is heading for a collision with the administration. The foreign aid bill is expected to come before the Senate this month. The dispute dispelled Israeli hopes of isolating the question of the guarantees, which Israel wants to back $10bn (Â£5.9bn) in borrowing to help finance Soviet Jewish immigration, from the peace process. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the hardline Israeli prime minister, refused to acknowledge that he had been asked to hold back the loan guarantee request, despite the disclosure by Mr Baker that he had twice talked to him about the matter. \"No one in the United States objects to our submitting this request. Therefore we are sub- mitting it. The day after tomor- row, the secretary of state will receive it,\" Mr Shamir told reporters. He added his government's rejection of linking the aid request to the peace initiative. \"We oppose any linkage of this kind. We don't believe it has any justification.\" However, the acute budget- ary strain caused by immigra- tion has made the guarantees an issue of vital importance for Israel, and therefore exposed Mr Shamir to US pressure. Mr Baker was careful to avoid saying support for the loan guarantees would depend on Israel's co-operation in the proposed peace conference. But he stressed that discussing large additional assistance for Israel, already the biggest recipient of US aid, could upset the delicate efforts to bring all sides to the table. Israel argues that the loans it wants guaranteed - and therefore made cheaper - are for a purely humanitarian cause of immigrant absorption. But its Arab opponents see the guarantees as an indirect sub- sidy for expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as evidenced by a recent Israeli building boom there. Washington has repeatedly demanded a halt to settlement, to no avail.",

   "text_content" : "By Christina Lamb in Brasilia HBAZIL's President Fernando Collor de Mello has stepped up negotiations with politicians and businessmen in what is believed to be an attempt to form a coalition \"government of national consensus\" to fight the worsening economic crisis. The president and his offi- dials have spent the past twc days talking to opposition poli- ticians appealing for a national dialogue to find a solution to the country's spiralling infla- tion - now back up to 15 per cent a month. Even Mr Collor's enemies have been contacted, such as Mr Orestes Quercia, leader or themain opposition arty, the Centre-left PMDB, d a future presidential candidate. The government's hopes are pinned on implementing a radi- cal overhaul of the constitution which would allow it to cut costs by sacking state employ- ees and to raise revenues by increasing taxes. There is little support for the changes either in congress or among state governors, but without it another shock economic plan is thought inevitable. Mr Collor plans to call a meeting of the Council of the Republic on September 17 to hammer out emergency legisla- tion on the constitutional over- haul to put before congress. The council, which comprises senior ministers and party eaders, meets only in times of dire emergency. After five economic shock plans in the last five years, realisation is growing that Bra- zil requires not short-term measures such as price fzes but long-term solutions based o.n putting the Treasury's own finances in order through polit- ical consensus. Although politi- cian seem more disposed to talk than at any time since Mr 0ollor took office in March last year, they are far from agreed on how this should translate into policy. To try to secure support the president may form a coalition with an opposition party such a the Social Democrats (PSDB).

His stance, however, failed to sat- isfy Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats of Hong Kong, the colony's largest political party. Mr Lee accused Britain of showing a \"lack of concern for the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong\". He described as \"highly ironic\" the contrast between Mr Major's tough stance on China's human rights record and Hong Kong's slow speed towards democracy. Mr Lee's party is likely to win a majority of the directly elected seats in next week's elections and wants full democracy immediately. In a let- ter to the prime minister, the party reminded him of Britain's earlier pledge to give Hong Kong democracy. \"Since then, Britain has been in con- stant retreat from this promise.\"",

   "text_content" : "b,~ Ganm members of Inaaawa-ika await mourners at a vigil for Susumu Ishii, their former leader, who died on . He was at tae centre or recent stocK scandals. By Stefan Wagstyl in Tokyo JAPANESE public prosecutors yesterday arrested a former executive of Kyowa Saitama Bank, a leading commercial bank, over his alleged involve- ment in an illegal loans scheme. Mr Kazuo Toyama was held on allegations of defrauding two financing companies of Y3.94bn (Â£17.2m) by using forged certificates of deposit. He became the fifth bank employee to be arrested in the current spate of illegal loans scandals which have also embroiled Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan, two other leading banks. The Tokyo District Public Prosecu- tor's Office suspects Mr Toy- ama used the fake documents to obtain loans illegally for a struggling car sales company. Meanwhile, two weeks of hearings at the Japanese par- liament into the scandals ended yesterday with testimo- nies from the presidents of IBJ, Fuji and Sumitomo Bank. Mr Yoh Kurosawa of IBJ denied that his bank was responsible for a loan.fraud discovered at Toyo Shlnkin Bank, a small Osaka bank, which lent huge amounts of money to Ms Nui Onone, a res- taurant owner. Ms Onoue and an executive of Toyo Shinkin are under arrest for procuring loans illegally using false doc- uments. Finance companies from whom Ms Onone bor- rowed argue that one reason they lent to her was that she was a client of IBJ. But Mr Kurosawa told a committee of the Diet's upper house that finance companies which lent Ms Onone money did so on their own judgment. Ms Onoue is on the brink of bankruptcy with debts of over Y400bn. Opposition MPs yesterday demanded that bankers and executives of securities compa- nies should be summoned again to the Diet because their answers had been unsatisfac- tory. But the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is blocking any such move. The hearings have produced moments of drama when MPs managed to catch a witness apparently contradicting him- self or another witness or when forced into a corner. In a memorable episode, Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, the former chairman of Nomura Securi- ties, the stockbroking com- pany, was asked to explain how Nomura had first been put in touch with Mr Susumu shli, the gangland chief who died this week and with whom Nomura had extensive deal- ings. Mr Tabuchi said the mid- dleman had been a sokai- ya - a type of extortionist specialising in disrupting com- pany meetings. Mr Tabuchi said he had been able to remember the man's name until the day before the hear- ing but had since forgotten it. The end of the hearings leaves it to the Ministry of Finance and the public prose- cutor's office to continue investigations. For MPs, the next task will be to examine reform proposals to be pres- ented soon by the ministry."

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "'Iy Rorii t Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor THE Commonwealth Secretariat is asking member countries to provide an extra Â£20m over the next five years to finance programmes arising from new policy priorities it is setting itself. In an address in London to the Commonwealth Trust and the Royal Institute of Interna- tional Affairs, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, said the new resources were urgently needed to tackle problems such as the promotion of democratic practices and human rights in member countries. The Commonwealth's priori- ties will be set out in a report on \"the role and structures of the Commonwealth in the 1990s and beyond\", due to be submitted by a high-level 10- nation committee to Common- wealth heads of government meeting in Harare next month. Chief Anyaoku implicitly admitted that some member countries had failed to honour some of the Commonwealth's most resounding declarations, such as the 1971 Singapore dec- laration on individual liberties, equal rights and free demo- cratic political processes. The main challenge facing the Commonwealth was to prove wrong those people who thought of it as \"a boring his- torical anachronism\" or no more than a talking shop whose members adopted gran- diose declarations more hon- oured in the breach than in the observance, through a more determined implementation of its principles and declarations. In coming years, the Com- monwealth could, \"in appropri- ate cases\", assist in the resolu- tion of conflicts arising from the introduction of pluralist political systems. Scope existed for the Commonwealth's well- tried mechanisms, such as spe- cial missions like the Eminent Persons' Group, which went to South Africa in 1986, and minis- terial committees, to be deployed more effectively to promote the Commonwealth's political objectives. Chief Anyaoku stressed, however, that democracy could not be a panacea for all prob- lems in member countries. There were many developing countries which had main- tained impeccable democratic credentials, but which were still wrestling with crippling development problems. Encouragement for democ- racy must therefore be accom- panied by effective action to address big socio-economic problems. \"Otherwise, there will be the risk of a backlash and eventual disillusionment with the democratic process.\" Referring to the decision by a committee of Commonwealth foreign ministers last February to implement a \"programmed management\" of the removal of sanctions against South Africa as objectives were met, Chief Anyaoku said that \"real obstacles\" still stood in the way of ending apartheid. Until the majority of the South Afri- can population was given full voting and constitutional rights or, at least, until such a development was \"clearly in sight\", it would be inappropri- ate to remove all the interna- tional pressure, without which the process of change could never have taken place. The Committee will be meet- ing in New Delhi next week to review the latest develop- ments.",

To the apparent distress of the White House and of Judge Thomas himself, conservative groups have begun to air hard- hitting television advertise- ments questioning the ethics of liberal Doemocratic senators who are expected to figure in the nomination debate, due to begin next week, such as Mr Edward Kennedy and Mr Joseph Biden. Mr Thomas's supporters fear the advertisments may be counterproductive by spurring opponents who have so far found him bud to attack. Mr John Sununu, President George Bush's chief of staff, has telephoned the advertise- ment's sponsors to urge them to withdraw it. The nomination of Mr Thomas, a 43-year-old black conservative lawyer, has divided civil rights groups and African-American organisa- tions, which have disagreed with his views but found it hard to oppose a man who has achieved his current position as a judge on the US appeals court from a background of poverty in segregated Georgia. The National Baptist Con- vention, the largest black church in the US, said Mr Thomas's nomination perpetu- ated \"stereotypes, myths and misrepresentations of our achievements as an African- American people\".",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Emilia Tagaza in Canberra THE Australian government has tightened media cross-own- ership rules to stop television proprietors from gaining indi- rect control of big newspapers through their associates. Amendments to broadcast- ing laws adopted by the cabi- net late on Wednesday night are designed to prevent further concentration of Australian media assets in the hands of a few owners. The government has been particularly worried about the bid for the Fairfax newspaper group, lodged recently by Tour- ang, a consortium led by Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian chairman of the London Daily Telegraph group, and Mr Kerry Packer, owner of the Channel Nine national network. Mr Packer has 14.9 per cent of Tourang, which is below the media cross-ownership thresh- old. The Broadcasting Act bars a radio or television licensee from controlling more than 15 per cent of major newspapers in the same market. However, two of Mr Packer's former employees hold 3 per cent each of Tourang. The amendment, expected to be approved in parliament, gave a clear definition of an \"associate\" and includes rela- tives, employees or employers and advisers. The amendments also give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal power to inquire into a buyer's associate relation- ships to determine if there is a likely breach of the 15 per cent cross-ownership limit or the 20 per cent foreign interest limit in an Australian radio or tele- vision station. Apart from the problem with cross-ownership limits, Tour- ang also faces a hurdle of for- eign ownership limits. Foreign holdings of more than 15 per cent require government approval."

   "text_content" : "MR Michael Heseltine, en- vironment secretary, yesterday confirmed a public inquiry decision that planning permis- sion be granted for the com- mercial redevelopment of County Hall, the former head- quarters of the Greater London Council, Vanessa Boulder writes. The London Residuary Body, which has the task of selling the building, welcomed the decision and said it could now begin serious negotiations with a number of interested buyers. The plans that won approval yesterday propose turning the building, situated across the Thames from parliament, into a hotel, business, residential and conference centre and erecting new office blocks behind it and to the east. Mr Heseltine's decision fol- lows a long planning battle in which the Labour party and the Labour-controlled Lambeth Borough Council, opposed the change of use for the building. A rival scheme for County Hall has been put forward by the London School of Econom- ics, which last month submit- ted a planning application to Lambeth council to use the building as a university. Lloyd's announces marketing plan LLOYD'S of London yesterday announced new marketing pro- posals designed to boost its share of the UK commercial insurance market. It has adopted a more aggressive approach to market- ing over the past two years, focusing initially on profes- sional indemnity, commercial motor, accident and health, term life and contingency insurance. * Rules governing restric- tions on the amount of insur- ance Lloyd's syndicates are permitted to write are to be liberalised. Syndicates will be allowed credits for certain kinds of reinsurance providing it is placed in Lloyd's and is no more than 25 per cent of gross premium income. Housing starts increase by 12% THE NUMBER of new houses started by builders rose sharply in the three months to the end of July, according to figures yesterday from the Environment Department. Housing starts rose by 12 per cent compared with the previ- ous three months and by 7.8 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Private-sector starts rose by 11 per cent and by 9.7 per cent respectively. Starts in July rose to 16,000 compared with 13,100 in July last year. One reason for the rise may have been a response to the brief rally in sales after the Gulf war ended in February. The rally has since ended. Sir Clifford Chetwood, chair- man of Wimpey, Britain's sec- ond largest housebuilder, said on Wednesday that there were no signs of any significant recovery in the housing mar- ket, which remained severely depressed.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Hugo DIxon BRITAIN'S telephone codes will have an extra digit added to thmp in Easter 1994. Oftel, the telecom municationsregu- latory body, said yesterday the nation was running out of numbers. The shortage has been caused by the proliferation of new telephone rserices, the arrival of competitors to BT and the growing trend among businesses to have direct lines for employees rather than rou- teing calls through switch- boards. For ordinary telephone lines, an extra \"1\" will be added after the initial \"0\" in the code, so that, for example, Oxford's 0865 code will become 01865. Other digits placed after the initial \"O\" will be used for ser- BT AND Mercury Comunicationu fie a challengeto their lucrative ply on international tesle ca from th company reponsib for running the otline between the rhite House and the Kremlin. World Communications, a special t US International telecommunlca tions company, says its service, lunched this week, umdercuts Mer cury by up to 20 per cent and BT by even more. The service will nitially ta=ret businesses that ipend more than Â£5,000 a alonth on internatlmal BT cut it ternatiol prices b an average of 10 per cent at the -KIIDnIfor this wwek and* MlerO iwesitu. WorldCom an id it wa In a position torespond to mny fur- ther price cuts from it larger rivals. It best deals are on calls to the US. _t peak times, it chares 85p a min- t, compared with BT's 54p. WorldCom claims to be the first company to compete in the Interna- onl call market since the govrn- mentprEtly d it to 'impetition in June. Other new entrant are expected because profit marglns, even after this week's price cuts, are particularly good. New regulations require World- Com's customers to have a private line between their premises and WorldCom's switch in the Clfy of -Lodon. Mr Peter Motbhu, viceres- Mont of WordCom, said he hoped the regulations would be further relaed so that the iervice could be ofer eto a wider range of customers -i a dial-up basids. WorldCom says it has six custom- :r, moat of them based in the City. e company, owned by TeleColum- bus of Switzerland, already ctive I the international privatenetwork market vices such as mobile communi- cations, freefone calls and pre- mium-rate services, thus ncreasing the potential supply of numbers tenfold. The change will require users to reprint stationery and promotional material, but busi- ness and user groups generally welcomed the move. The Con- federation of British Industry said Oftel had chosen the best means of creating extra num- bering capacity, which was needed for business-to-business communications. \"It will cause minimum dis- ruption because plenty of notice has been given,\" the CBm The Telecommunications Users' Association said the code change would ultimately increase opportunities for users by promoting competi- tion and choice. For Londoners, the change will be the second in four years. Last year, the capital's old 01 code was replaced by 071 for inner London and 081 for outer London - also the result of a numbers famine. Those codes will become 0171 and 0181. Oftel added that the interna- tional dialling code would change from 010 to 00 at Easter 1Ma to harmonise with the rest of the European Community. The regulatory body said plans for other special num- bers would be announced in due course. It is expected to decide that Britain's 999 enmer- gency number should be changed to 112, again to har- monise with the EC. Oftel reaffirmed its intention to ensure that BT and other telephone companies intro- duced \"portable\" numbers where that was cost-effective. This would allow users to keep their numbers if they switched from one carrier to another. The Cable Television Associ- ation, whose members compete with BT at the local level for telephone services, said it was disappointed that Oftel had not set a definite date for number portability. Its members would find it difficult to win custom- ers from BT as long as they were required to abandon their old numbers. BT personal contracts, Page 8",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Richard Tomkins explains how central London is paying the price for road and rail links down-river Hard-headed decision: public transport minister Roger Freeman in Docklands, which has Â£.5bn of road and rail schemes under way or completed PERCHED on a bridge as he neared the end of a week-long tour of Lon- don Docklands yesterday, Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, uncon- sciously highlighted a paradox in the government's attitude to transport spending in London. His visit had been prompted by criticisms from Docklands developers such as Olympia & York, the developer of Canary Wharf, about the inadequacy of the area's transport links - in particular the notoriously unreliable Docklands Light Railway, which at present forms the area's main link with the capital. Mr Freeman acknowledged that the railway was unrelia- ble. He said that was unsatis- factory and action was being taken to put matters right. He emphasised: \"Taxpayers' money is not a constraint to the solution of this problem.\" Seconds later, facing ques- tions on the government's response to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on London Underground, he said the government would do what it could to support sensible and prudent expenditure on the network - but it had to bear in mind the overall constraints on public expenditure. \"There must be a limit to the tax- payer,\" he said. The juxtaposition of those two statements comes as a sharp reminder of the fact that investment in the capital's creaking and overburdened transport infrastructure is dwarfed by the money going on transport in Docklands. Road and rail schemes cost- ing Â£3.5bn are either complete or due for completion in the area over the next five years. The main ones are: * Docklands Light Railway. This is being extended to Beck- ton in the east and Lewisham in the south. It is also being upgraded to increase capacity. Total cost: more than Â£800m. * Jubilee Line extension. The Jubilee Line is being extended from Green Park in central London to Canary Wharf and Docklands, with completion due in 1996. Total cost: more than Â£lbn. * Roads. London Docklands Development Corporation and the Department of Transport have embarked on a big road- building programme. Total cost: more than Â£1.65bn. By comparison, investment in new transport capacity within central London has vir- tually halted. Road building has long been ruled out to ease the capital's problems. The bus fleet is ageing and no new Underground line, apart from a stretch of the Jubilee Line, has opened since the Victoria Line was finished in 1971. In January 1989, the govern- ment-sponsored Central Lon- don Rail Study concluded that the capital's transport difficul- ties were so severe as to war- rant spending Â£1.5bn on an extensive upgrading of the Underground and upwards of -2bn on constructing two new cross-city railwa lines. he government has gone only halfway to adopt- ing those recommenda- tions. It has authorli a Â£720m upgrading of the Line, much of which of renewing existing assets; it has authorised the Â£75m upgrading of the Underground station at the Angel, north London; and, most signifi- cantly, it has authorised con- struction of the Â£1.5bn Cross- Rail Line, which will take mainline trains under London between British Rail's Padding- ton and Liverpool Street sta lions. CrossRail, however, will not open until at least 1999, and dates for other projects - the desperately needed Chelsea- Hackney cross-city link, upgrading of the Northern Line and expansion of the underground stations at main line terminuses - are retreat- ing into the next century. The Docklands developers - notably Olympia & York - have made their case for better transport in Docklands on the basis of the forecast generation of employment there. Govern- nefint figures d6, indeed, pre- dict a massive surge in jobs. Docklands employment is expected to grow from 40,00C now t ,000 in 2001 and 20,000 That' '-is more than a.matched' byvthe forecast growth in central London employment. Government fig- ures predict the number of jobs rising there from 1.02m now to 1.168m in 2001 and 1.212m in 2011. London Transport does not disguise its concern over the priorities being set by the gov- ernment. Central London's transport ills, it says, are real, immense and pressing, while those of Docklands lie some- where in the nebulous future. Mr David Bayliss, LT's direc- tor of planning, says: \"From a purely transport point of view, our priorities are safety and congestion relief on the exist- ing system and major new infrastructure projects for cen- tral London, like CrossRail and Chelsea-Hackney, before we invest very large additional sums in new infrastructure for Docklands.\" Yet, as LT acknowledges, deeper political imperatives lie behind the need for transport investment in Docklands. Without good transport links, Docklands-simply will not hap- pen - and that would be more than unfair to developers such as Olympia & York which have been persuaded by the govern- ment to back the area. For central London, the obstacle is that there is not enough money in the govern- ment pot to buy good transport for Docklands and for the rest of the capital. Mr Wilfrid New- ton, LT chairman, admits that he would not want to be the minister who had to choose. Mr Freeman and his colleagues have chosen Docklands, and the rest of London appears to be paying.the price."

   "article_dc_title" : "Property Valuers Can Tender for Council Tax Work",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans PROPERTY valuers in the private sector are being invited to tender for 14m of the 21m domestic valuations in England and Wales required by the introduction of the govern- ment's new council tax in April 1993. The Inland Revenue Valua- tion Office, which will have overall responsibility for the project, yesterday launched a series of advertisements aimed at private firms keen to play a part in the valuation process. The council tax, which is to replace the poll tax, will be based on the value of each property placed in one of eight bands ranging from under Â£40,0 to over Â£320,000 in England and from under Â£30,000 to over Â£240,000 in Wales. Because of the scale of the task facing the valuation office, ministers have decided that private firms will be offered the opportunity to ten- der for two thirds of the work. The valuation office will tender for some of the work, as well as carrying out the remaining third. The work will come as a relief to many valuers and estate agents facing redundan- cies and closure because of the property decline, but govern- ment officials emphasised yes- terday that the tendering pro- cess and competition would ensure that excessive prices were not paid. Contracts will generally cover between 10,000 and 20,000 domestic properties in England and 5,000 to 20,000 in Wales, separated into clearly defined geographical areas. Properties will be banded into the eight categories on the basis of open market value - in practice, that will mean that whole streets will automati- cally be placed in the same band. There will often be no need for individual valuations. The main difficulty will arise when a valuation is close to a band border and there is a dif- ference of opinion over which band it should be in. To ensure fairness, tendering bids from the valuation office will be registered with the environment department before bids are received from the private sector. Firms are asked to register their interest at their local val- uation office from September 10 and to complete a form giv- ing details of professional com- petence and financial viability by September 27.",

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith LIBERAL DEMOCRATS should not waste time on election pre- dictions and should concen- trate on issues other than con- stitutional reform at next week's conference, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, said yesterday. Preparing for the party's gathering at Bournemouth, which will mark the start of the last pre-election conference season, Mr Ashdown said he believed a final swing or surge among the public had yet to come before the election, and that Labour had made a strate- gic error in \"not presenting a real alternative to the Conse- vatives\". The Liberal Democrats, he said, had acquired a distinctive body of policy that would be drawn together at the confer- ence, and he was prepared to \"take risks\" to help ensure that the party established a positive core vote and did not simply provide a home for pro= test votes. While making clear that the party still regards con- stitutional reform as the necessary precondition for improved policies across a range of issues, Mr Ashdown said he envisaged that the party would be \"arguing about the rest of the agenda\" next week. He will use one of two speeches next week to spell out the details of the most promi- nent risk the party has taken so far - its pledge to raise income tax by Ip in the pound if necessary to fund investment in education - by saying how much more money the party intends to raise and on which elements of education policy it would be spent. Although the leadership expects a united and aconfident conference in Bournemouth, there were some suggestions that the representatives might ive a rough ride to aspects of the proposed economic strat- egy, such as competition policy and the introduction of regional pay bargaining in the public sector. Mr Ashdown brushed aside the current memoir-driven wrangling between Dr David Owen and Lord (formerly Mr Roy) Jenkins, both of whom were among the founder mem- bers in 1981 of the Social Demo- cratic party, which merged with the Liberal party In 1988. It was, he said, \"an historical exercise\".",

The previously undisclosed report was prepared by accoun- tants Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, appointed by the Caymans to untangle and oversee BCCI's affairs in the islands. The report was filed in court this week and made available to depositors and creditors. It says the offshore banking entity, BCCI (Overseas), had two arms, both controlled by head offices based first in Lon- don and later in Abu Dhabi. One arm was a network of 63 branches in 28 countries that had little contact with the office. The other arm, known as BCCI Cayman, had $3.3bn in loans. It served as a booking unit for BCCI's sour loans around the world and had $2.2bn outstanding to 10 uni- dentified Middle East entities. More than half of the bank's $753m in deposits were also from related BCCI entities. The report said many of BCCI's non-performing loans were booked in the Caymans in 1990, when total loans out- standing more than doubled to $3.lbn. The auditors said they do not know whether the loans could be collected and could not say whether a current $168m loan loss provision was adequate. But the report said 80 per cent of the loans were covered by \"a complex agreement\" with an unnamed third party. In 1990 the losses in BCCI Dayman, excluding the branch network, were $228.7u.. Another $90.5m was built up in the first six months of 1991. 'The report said the main rea son for the mounting losses at BCCI Cayman was a drop in income. On top of earlier losses, that left BCCI (Overseas) with accu- mulated losses of $637.8m a month before it was seized.",

Although two of Capcom Financial Services officers were arrested and later con- victed in London of money laundering, the company itself was never indicted. In June 1989, the Association of International Bond Dealers suspended Capcom, the main brokers for BCCI's treasury operations, after investigations into its investment activities. About a month earlier, Capcom had also been suspended for six months by the London International Financial Futures Exchange. In July 1989 the Association of Futures Dealers and Brokers expelled Capcom because the company would not identify its owners. Later the same year the Chi- cago Mercantile Exchange fined Capcom $500,000 and the firm agreed to leave the exchange."

Eight of those companies will for the firstime in the UK attempt to tap methane gas from coalfields. Thirty-seven areas were opened for exploration as small oil companies converted old licences and won new blocks. Marches Oil won its first block between Sutton and Purley in Surrey, and Triton Resources took a new block in the Weald area of Sussex and Kent, where it already holds six licences. Few local residents will have noticed lorries covering only 6km a day through the country roads as Triton conducted its recent seismic campaign over hundreds of miles. Teredo Petroleum, formerly Marinex, operates two licences in Surrey. \"We are still hope- ful,\" said Mr Michael Seymour, Teredo's managing director. The company has already found a field in Brockham, near Dorking, which it would like to develop. The chances of finding oil may seem slim, but Humbly Grove, Kelt UK's field near Basingstoke in Hampshire, pro- duces about 1,000 barrels of oil a day. Cairn Energy's Palmers Wood oilfleld, in Surrey, pro- duces about 1,400 barrels a day. Cairn said: \"It's a very viable little field.\" Kirkland Resources, a sub- sidiary of the Norwegian oil company Kirkland AS based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is opting to tap methane from the coal-rich Glamorgan area in south Wales. \"We estimate there is around 18 trillion [million mil- lion] cu ft of methane in this area,\" said Mr Short Allerton, Kirkland's general manager. \"We can use it to generate electricity or sell it into the grid.\" He estimates the flow rate from one well could generate 1MW of electricity, enough to run 1,000 electric fires, while three wells could provide enough for a hospital.",

   "text_content" : "-? '4 Cracking under the strain: faults on BR's Class 158 diesel express trains will be repaired under warranty by Brel By James Buxton, Scottish Correspondent BREL, the railway vehicle manufacturer, is facing a fresh blow with the recall under warranty of much of British Rail's fleet of Class 158 diesel express trains. Earlier this week Brel replaced Mr Peter Holdstock as chief executive because of the company's failure to deliver trains to BR on time. He was replaced by Mr Bo Sodersten, a Swede connected with Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swed- ish engineering company which owns 40 per cent of Brel. Brel, which made the Class 158s, will pay for substantial modifications to them. The THE Health and Safety Executive and BR inspectors are to run a special train between London and Carlisle to carry out experiments as part of an investigation of train doors. Since 1979, 212 passengers have died after falling from trains and 127 have been seriously injured. The special train will be equipped with sensors and designed to simulate a nor mal BR operation. The results should be available by the end of the year. cost to the company, which was privatised two years ago, has not been disclosed. About 90 two-carriage trains, which were intended to operate a high-quality, 90mph service on BR's regional routes, are being taken out of service four at a time. Brel at Derby and BR's engi- neering yard at Springburn, Glasgow, will replace alumin- ium supports carrying equip- ment under the aluminium trains, and mend cracks in the door surrounds. The air-condi- tioning equipment, which has failed on many of the trains in Scotland, will also be repaired. The work began about six weeks ago. BR is warning passengers in Scotland that some trains may have fewer carriages than planned, which \"may lead to some overcrowding or delays\".

   "text_content" : "By Chris Tighe BRITISH RAIL's InterCity division yesterday launched its biggest-ever free travel offer, intended to boost its leisure passenger numbers at a time when economic recession has depressed business travel. The promotion - two seats for the price of one - devised in conjunction with Boots, the chemist, coincides with the introduction on September 30 of InterCity's new timetable, incorporating the full effects of its Â£550m East Coast line elec- trification. About Â£50m worth of jour- neys will be given away in the free travel promotion. Anyone spending Â£5 or more at Boots stores between September 11 and November 5 will receive a voucher allowing two people to travel for the price of one adult super-saver ticket on most InterCity or other longer. distance trains. InterCity expects 2m free rail journeys to be made as a result but has allocated more than 1lin seats, an average of 90 to 100 per train, for people taking up the offer. Launching the new timetable yesterday, Dr John Prideaux, InterCity's managing director, said Inter- City was now running more trains at over 100 mph than any other country in Europe. He indicated that among pas- sengers who used trains infre- quently, InterCity needed to tackle an outdated image of rail travel. Dr Prideaux said electrifica- tion would have knock-on ben- efits, as InterCity 125s being replaced on the east-coast line by the new 225s were being used to upgrade services else- where. About 240 sub-standard coaches will be withdrawn. The Central Transport Con- sultative Committee, the pas- senger watchdog, gave only qualified approval for the new timetable. Although east-coast services had improved, an offi- clal said, the number of Inter- City trains to north Wales had been halved. He also said all Saturday night sleepers had been with- drawn."

Union Congress last night to uiaderienewed ire roM the government' as It refirmed .terinms for the re- afflUitiom of the EETPU elec- tricinis' union, which was expelled three years ago. The TUC voted overwhelm- ingly to support a resolution saying its Bridlington rles, which govern inter-union dis- putes and which led to the EETPU's expulsion, were as important as ever. Readmis- sion of the EETPU could not be countenanced unless the union, or any union with which it sought to amalgam- ate, accepted the rules. The resolution, which con- demned the EETPU for attempting to poach members of other union, was supported by all affiliates except the AEU engineers, who are holding merger talks with the electri- cians. Mr Michael Howard, employ- ment secretary, said the resolu- tion represented a permanent cold shoulder to the EETPU and indicated the TUC was determined to reject and exclude anyone who offered modernity or common sense. The Bridlington principles were long discredited and gave unions the power to dragoon ordinary members into unions to which they did not wish to belong, he said. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU presi- dent, said he remained confi- dent that a merger would go ahead and that the combined union would be afiliated to the TUC. The AEU was the only union to vote against the expulsion of the EETPU three years ago. During yesterday's debate, Mr Jordan received a hostile reception when he said the AEU and the EETPU had been fighting together for better pay and conditions before most unions were even a gleam in the movement's eyes. The resolution follows attempts by the EETPU to recruit members of other unions, including those of Ucatt, the troubled construc- tion union. Poaching is forbid- den under the Bridlington agreement. Mr Norman Willis, TUC gen- eral-secretary, said the EETPU could not be readmitted to the TUC until it accepted the same rules as every other organisa- tion. \"The EETPU's recent con- duct is a breach of work- ing-class morality. The hand of welcome is held out to the EETPU - but it has to be by the rulebook of the TUC.\""

   "text_content" : "By Diane Summers, Labour Staff 'BT IS to offer its 1,400 field salesforce personal contracts in its first move to end collective bargaining for a largely non. managerial group. The Society of Telecom Exec- utives, the main union affected, is urging its members not to accept the deal, claiming that BT is attempting to \"buy out\" sales staff for Â£1,000 or less each. The company has been mov- ing away from collective bar ganing and towards personal contracts for its managerial grades over the past two years. The STE says about 4,500 out of 5,000 senior and middle man- agers have accepted personal contracts. The union claims that a sur vey of members earlier this year showed that middle man- agers on personal contracts had received less in pay and bionuses than those who had remained part of collective bar- gaining negotiations. BT said yesterday the move to personal contracts would give it flexibility to respond quickly on pay to market con ditions and so retain key staff. t would also allow pay to be linked to performance. There were no plans to extend personal contracts tc engineering, clerical or opera tor staff, the company said. The STE said yesterday: \"Any attempt to purchase trade union rights is not on. We have advised our members not to accept the terms.\" 0 The National Communica- tion Union, which represents BT engineers and clerical staff, warned that it might be forced to move towards an industrial action ballot if it failed to get satisfactory severance agree- ments for its members leaving the company voluntarily. Leaders of the Union of Com- munication Workers, which represents BT operators, have already announced that they will urge their members to strike over a voluntary redun- dancy offer. The NCU said it would rule out the terms offered to the UCW and would be looking for improved lump-sum pay- ments and early payment of pensions. Mr Tony Young, NCU gen- eral secretary, said the union faced significant job losses, with at least 6,300 engi- neering and an unspecified number of clerical posts being cut. He warned BT management not to risk jeopardising the commitment and co-operation of staff as negotiations pro- ceeded on the reduction of the workforce.",

   "text_content" : "A, . TTBMPTING to win employment rights for part-time workers is a full-time struggle for trade union officials. They are con- fronting a system that grants -part-timers few, if any, rights and the combined obduracy of the government, employers' organisations and the manager on the shop floor. Yet in spite of the many impassioned pleas for better ights heard from the congress floor this week, trade unions do not have a spotless record on the issue. Only recently have they actively set out to court part- timers as the reality has sunk in that, with the decline of manufacturing industry and the growth of the service sec- tor, the number of male, full-time jobs being created comes a poor second to new, female part-time posi- tions. Between 1983 and 1990, for example, nearly 1.8m new jobs were created, according to gov- ernment statistics. Women won 1.65m of those jobs and 871,000 were part-timers. During the same period, male, full-time jobs decreased by 76,000. Some 5.6m people work part-time in the UK, about a quarter of the workforce. Within the EC, only the Netherlands and Denmark have a higher percentage of part-timers. The vast majority, 5.1m, work in service indus- tries, especially retail, cleaning, education, health and hotels and catering. All projec- tions see the proportion of part-time workers growing, highlighting their importance to the economy. Nine out of 10 part-timers are women and eight in 10 are married. The unions battle in defence of those workers from the least advantageous posi- tion. Ms Christine Crawley, MEF for Birmingham East, who heads the European Parlia- ment's committee for women's rights, said: \"It isn't compul sory for part-time workers to have worse conditions than their full-time counterparts - though in the UK you'd think it was.\" The UK and Ireland are the Disadvantaged: Part-time staff, like many office cleaners, miss out on rights and benefits enjoyed by full-time workers only EC member states that distinguish in terms of legal rights between part-time and full-time work. Employees working less than eight hours a week do not qual- ify for redundancy pay or com- pensation for unfair dismissal, for maternity leave or the right to return to the job after the baby's birth. They can be dis- missed without notice. Those working more than eight hours but less than 16 hours a week must have accu- mulated five years' continuous service to qualify for those rights, compared with only two years for all employees work- ing 16 hours or more a week. Ms Maureen O'Mara, wom- en's officer of Nupe, represent- ing 600,000 health service and local-government employees, said: \"There is a really exploited workforce out there who never manage to get any employment protection.\" She says it is not uncommon for women to combine two or even three part-time jobs. \"I talk to women who leave the house at 5.30 am for a cleaning job. They are back home at 8 am to get the chil- dren off to school, then out to a midday supervisor's job at school for two hours, and finally out again at 6 pm for a couple more hours of cleaning. All without any of the benefits of a full-time employee.\" Nupe, with the highest female membership of any British trade union (450,000) and the highest percentage of part-timers (60 per cent), strongly supports the EC draft directives on part-time and temporary work published last year. The directives are aimed at winning the EC's 14m part-time and 10m temporary workers the same rights and benefits on a pro rata basis as full-time workers. The most controversial direc- tive would oblige employers to pay full social security contri- butions for part-timers work- ing more than eight hours a week and provide the same entitlement to holidays, redun- dancy pay and seniority allow- ances as full-timers, on a pro rata basis. The government has fiercely criticised the direc- tives. Mr Michael Howard, Employment Secretary, says they would increase unemploy- ment and damage British com- panies' competitiveness. The Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Direc- tors and the British Chambers of Commerce have been equally hostile. Yet many companies, espe- cially in the banking, finance and retail industries, now offer part-timers all benefits on a pro rata basis. They have been implemented, according to the Equal Opportunities Commis- sion, \"without apparent loss of job security, in fact, more part-time workers are consis- tently being employed in these areas\". The commission earlier this year began judicial review pro- ceedings against the govern- ment, challenging the legality of the qualifying periods for receipt of statutory redun- dancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal. It argues that the UK is breaching its obligations under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome - which ensures that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work - by providing less favourable treat- ment of part-time workers (most of whom are women) than of full-time workers (most of whom are men) in relation to receipt of those statutory benefits. Two European Court deci- sions strengthening the posi- tion of part-timers (Bilka-Kauf- haus 1987, and Rinner-Kuhn 1989) relied on Article 119, and many unions are now realising the potential of using Euro- pean law to ease discrimina- tion against part-timers. Employers are agreed that part-time workers provide greater flexibility - allowing them to match staffing levels to peaks and troughs in demand. As the drive for flexibility throughout industry continues, so will the increased use of part-timers. The challenge for unions will be to draw them into their fold.",

Does this mean that flying saucers have landed at the TUC's Bloomsbury headquar- ters? Has Norman Willis had a close encounter of the third kind? Will quality circles be replaced with corn circles? In 1950s B movies, such approaches invariably led to the infiltration of extra-terres- trials into the human race. Ref- erences to Arthur Scargill not living on the same planet take on a new and menacing conno- tation. However, if intergalactic explorers were indeed to turn up at congress, they would surely not recommend coloni- sation. A report on the planet Earth written from the TUC would conclude that men outnumber women by five to one. The typ- ical earthling at congress is 54, weighs 14 stone and consumes huge quantities of liquid every NOTEBOOK By John Willman evening. Their days are spent slumbering in vast chambers, while leaders tell fabulous tales of days when unions were a power in the land and fore- cast a second coming. In fact the MSS motion cov- ers rather more down-to-earth matters. The threat to life as we know it comes not from the planet Tharg but from Japa- nese inward investment. Apparently companies such as Nissan, Pioneer and Pana- sonic have been opening facto- ries throughout the UK, in fla- grant disregard of the decline of British manufacturing industry. The result has been to make the UK once again a significant exporter of cars and electrical appli- ances. What makes this really \"alien\" is that the Japanese companies invite unions to organise the workforce. The normal procedure when com- panies from countries like the US open plants in the UK is to exclude unions by every possi- ble step. MSS is particularly censori- ous of beauty contests, where a company invites unions to bid for representation rights long before the first employee is signed up. It plaintively sug- gests that there are advantages in having several unions to represent employees. And it condemns non-strike agree- ments - perhaps hoping that Japanese investors will iden- tify with the British hara-kiri approach to solving industrial disputes. The TUC general council will be recommending delegates to accept the motion, with reser- vations. But there will be a dis- senting minority who cannot swallow the sentiments - including the AEU, which points out that MSS is one of five unions currently pitching for the Toyota account. A rather better example of proletarian internationalism was demonstrated yesterday in the debate on international affairs. It involved the usual series of motions sorting out the intractable issues of eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and South Africa in just over an hour. Apart from warming the cockles of the heart, it was ter- ritory into which Mr Michael Howard. the tenacious employ- ment minister, seemed unlikely to follow. Yet it took the tiny Rossen- dale Union of Boot, Shoe and Slipper Operatives to raise the issue of exploitation in Third World free-trade zones. The general secretary of the 2,329strong union cited horri- fying examples from Indonesia and the Dominican Republic and demanded international action to enforce conventions on child labour and the like. And that really was alien, in a week in which naked self-in- terest seemed all-pervasive.",

Yet, according to an article* in the latest Harvard Business Review, McDonald's is far from a model of how a modern service businese should be run. Indeed, the article condemns the company's methods as an anachronism, increasingly handicappipr its competitiveness. The authurs, Professors Leonard Schlesinger and James Heskett of the Harvard Business School, argue that McDonald's is one of many American service companies which are being penalised by what was once their greatest strength: a stan dardised, production-line approach which deliberately emphasises tech nology, machines and systems and seeks to minimise the role of people. \"Front-line customer-contact jobs are designed to be as simple and narrow as possible so that they can be filled by almost anyone - idiot proof jobs,\" the article sauy. \"Unfor- tunately, however, this industrial model flies in the face of what ser- vice-sector customers many times value most: the things that techno- ogy cannot do at al or as well as thinking human beings. \"In fact, the more that technology becomes a standard part of deliver- ing services, the more important personal interactions are in satisfy- ing customers and in differentiating competitors.\" The result of the McDonald's- style approach is to lock companies into a \"cycle of failure\", the authors say. By offering unrewarding jobs, low wages and meagre training, they attract mediocre recruits and suffer high rates of staff turnover, further undermining customer ser- vice quality. The bleak prognosis is underlined by an accompanying article** by Stephen Roach, senior economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, whno argues that the entire US ser- vices sector is set for a shake-up as violent as that experienced by man- ufacturing industry in the past decade. Though the US services sector has invested massively in automa- tion - it accounts for more th an 85 r cent of the country's instaleI nformation technology base - pro- ductivity has stagnated because companies have not cut costs by streamlining their workforces. Roach contends this inefficiency will be increasingly exposed by competition from foreign companies ente the US services market. The three authors agree that new accounting and information systems are needed to pinpoint 'those areas where investments by service industries will yield the big- gest returns. Though such measure- ments are notoriously difficult, Schlesinger and Heskett offer some guidelines as to where companies should focus their efforts. They point to research which shows that customers' loyalty has much to do with the attitudes of sales staff: two thirds of defecting customers cite unsatisfactory ser- vice as the main source of discon- tent. Service quality, in turn, is closely linked with staff turnover. Surveys by Sears, the large US retailer, have found consistently higher customer satisfaction at stores with low staff turnover. Mar- riott, the hotel chain, estimates that a 10 per cent cut in staff turnover would lower the number of \"non- repeat\" customers by Ito 3per cent- =nd Increase annual ievenues by between O5Gm and 8150m. However, the article say, puttir service back into service ndustrie pends crucially on redefining cus- tomer satisfaction criteria and focusing human resources on ach- Taco Bell. a US fast-food chain owned by PepsiCo, is held up as a shining example. Since the late 1980s, Taco Bell has extenisively' restructured its business and intro- duced a number of innovations. They include: * Careful recruitment of highly motivated sales staff able to work well under pressure, combined with continuous training. Higher staff quality enables each supervisor to control 20 restaurants, compared with only five three years ago. * Freeing staff to concentrate on serving customers. Electronic infor- mation systems have cut by 15 hours a week the time spent by restaurant managers on paperwork, while food preparation has been removed from restaurants to large- scale central facilities. At McDonald's, where food is still prepared at the restaurants, ever more complicated menus require McD oald's Iiof m many US compnies penalleed by what was one* their greatest strength\" managers to devote increasing attention to \"back-room\" operations. * More sophisticated measurement of service quality and customer sat- isfaction, coupled with perfor- mance-related pay for restaurant managers. As well as improving staff morale, these changes have pro- duced an impressive financial per- fonarmance. In the past three year-, sales growth at company-owned Taco Bells has exceeded 60 per cent while profits have risen by more than 25 per cent a year. By contrast, McDonald's US res- taurants increased profits by less than six per cent annually over the same period and their market share is increasingly under pressure. The authors warn that raising service quality is a \"tumultuous\" process, requiring an unshakable belief that it will pay off financially in the long run. Of all the chal- lenges facing \"old model\" service companies, they suggest, the toughest is to recognise that their failures stem not from mistakes down the line but from deliberate choices by top management. * The service-driven service com- pany. \"Services under siege - the restructuring imperative.

   "text_content" : "Patti Waldmeir reports that the resources group is now forging friendships with its former critics he new South Africa is a place rich in irony. For more than a decade, the African National Congress (ANC) led a worldwide cam- paign to force Shell to pull out of South Africa. But when the ANC returned to Johannesburg after 30 years in exile, it did not let this stand in the way of a healthy com- mercial relationship with the company. Earlier this year, when Shell moved to a new building, the ANC bought Shell House in Johannesburg as its national headquarters; Shell, which officially remains on the ANC blacklist, threw a party to welcome the new owners. So as the political situation improves in South Africa, Shell's decision to remain - it was the most prominent West- ern company to resist disin- vestment - can be judged against new standards of cor- porate citizenship in a post- apartheid society. For ANC officials are discov- ering, to their dismay, that investment halted by their pro- tests in the 1980s may have been lost to South Africa for ever. \"I don't believe disinvest- ment had the effect that its architects believed it would have,\" says John Kilroe, chair- man and chief executive of Shell South Africa, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group with turn- over last year of R5.5bn (Â£1.14bn). Under new ownership, com- panies stopped complying with the liberal principles set out under the European Commu- iity and Sullivan codes of busi- ness conduct, which set mini- mum wage levels and guidelines for black advance- mient. \"The new own- ers. . .considered that these things were done for people overseas; we don't have to do them now,\" he explains. Under the new owners, edu- cational programmes were halted, social responsibility spending fell, unemployment rose. \"The people who really benefited were the South Afri- can companies which picked up these assets at bargain basement prices,\" Kilroe argues. On the political level, the ANC insists that disinvestment played a significant role in for- cing the ruling National Party to abandon 40-odd years of apartheid policy. Economists and businessmen dispute this, arguing that the disciplines of the marketplace were far more effective than either disinvest- ment or trade sanctions. Kilroe sees the political liber- alisation of the past 18 months not as proof of the coercive power of disinvestment, but as vindication of Shell's decision to remain. \"It's satisfying to know our belief that Shell could achieve more by staying in South Africa than by disin- vesting has been vindicated,\" he says in the company's 1990 business report. \"The changes now being introduced are changes for which we have worked long and hard. They represent final recognition of the evil of apartheid, a commit- ment to positive renewal, and justification of our role in the process of change.\" The degree to which Pretoria was influenced by liberal proc nouncements from business - particularly foreign-based busi- ness - must remain open to doubt. But Shell none the less did its part for human rights; week after week, it placed full page advertisements in small news papers which held out against apartheid at its most repres sive. Left-wing publications such as the Weekly Mail, the Afrikaans Vrye Weekblad and the ANC-supported New Nation faced police harassment and censorship under the state of emergency of the late 1980s; they condemned human rights abuses ignored by mainstream papers. Shell was a major source of their finance; its adverts praised a free press, condemned residential segrega tion and championed non racial democracy. So at the level of rhetoric, Shell took a high profile stand against apartheid. Indeed, the company even participated in one of the most important street demonstrations ever staged against Pretoria: a pro- test march through the streets of Cape Town (Shell's head- quarters) in September 1989. When one of the largest crowds in South African his- tory set out to march on the city hall, a Shell executive was in the vanguard, along with church and other business leaders. Pretoria's decision to allow the protest to go ahead peace- fully marked a turning point; it was the first sign that F.W. de Klerk was serious about politi- cal liberalisation. But Kilroe insists that Shell's opposition was never political; apartheid was simply not the ideology on which to base a society \"in which South Africans can prosper and Shell South Africa can prosper along with them\". That prosperity will depend, most of all, on education. \"The economy can't grow at 5 per cent a year, as it must do, because there are not enough scientists and engineers,\" says the Shell chairman. (According to Shell, out of 10,000 black school entrants, only 27 gain entrance to university, and only one enters university to study maths and sciences. Only one per cent of blacks gets any technical training.) \"We earmarked the problem with maths and sciences for special attention,\" Kilroe says. The company sponsors a train- ing programme for maths and science teachers at the Univer- sity of Natal, and offers univer- sity scholarships for blacks, who are first sent to private schools for a year-long prep course to help upgrade the poor quality of their pre-uni- versity schooling. Overall, Shell spent R6.1m in 1990 on education projects; it estimates that 2.2m children benefited from these programmes. Overall, the company spends 7 to 8 per cent of net income on social responsibility pro- grammes, which is relatively high by South African stan- dards and compares with roughly 1 per cent for other Shell companies worldwide. That fact leads Shell's main trade union adversary, Rod Crompton of the Chemical Workers union, to compare the company to \"a man who goes to the pub and buys drinks for all his friends and has nothing left for his family\". But this criticism is surely unfair: staff terms and condi tions are at least in line with the industry average; salaries are well above the minima set by the EC code of conduct; and judging by the low level of strike action, Shell employees are not seriously dissatisfied last year, only 1 per cent of working hours was lost through strikes. The percentage of black managers in Shell is still piti- fully low - though that could be said of almost every South African company. Though 70 per cent of staff are black, only 15 per cent of managers are non-white (27 per cent at super- visory level or above). Shell says its goal is to have 20 per cent black managers by next year \"to window dress,\" says Kilroe. \"People have to be promoted on merit,\" he adds, noting that the company recently appointed its first black executive. He is Hum- phrey Khoza, public affairs director - the sort of highly visible (and often not too demanding) post traditionally given to blacks in companies trying to prove their non-racial employment policies. \"You can't be an equal opportunity company and go out into an environment that's not equal at all,\" Kilroe points out, acknowledging that much more remains to be done. But of one thing he is cer- tain: that Shell was right to stay and work for change from within. And to judge from the ANC's eagerness to purchase Shell House, it seems unlikely that the company's stand on disinvestment will have any long-term impact on its com- mercial prospects. For the time will soon have passed when politics takes precedence over economics and the ANC knows it will need companies like Shell to build the new South Africa.",

   "text_content" : "IBM's mid-range computers are critical to its recovery from damage inflictedby a stagnant market, writes Alan Cane nternational Business iiMachines (IBM), the wodld's largest computer -maOufacturer, earlierthis week launched a small com- puter aimed at the strategi- cally important mid-range mar- hot. Big Blue has taken a battering In the past year in a market which has seen sales plummet and is looking to the new model for a much-needed shot in the arm. The mid-range area covers computer systems for small businesses and departments of larger ones. In the past couple of years, it has emerged as the most important area of growth in the computer business, increasing by about 10 per cent a year. In the US, personal computer sales are stagnant (0.3 per cent revenue growth in 1991), while sales of mainframe are, if anything, in retreat. At just $12,000 (Â£8,879 in the UK), IBM's new machine, the 9402 Model D02, represents a technological and performance breakthrough for IBM. For the first time in the AS/400 range - IBM's middle market sector - all the electronics of the logic circuits are contained on a single printed circuit board compared with two for the next machine in the range, the D04, and three for the original machine in the ASD/400 range. The improved technology has resulted two main benefits: the new machine offers 18 per cent better performance and is 26 per cent cheaper than its predecessor. For the first time, the operat- ing system and some applica- tion software will be provided ready loaded on the machine - the so-called \"plug and go\" concept. The launch, however, serves principally to highlight the dif- ficulties faced by customers in deciding what mid-range machine is best for them, and the questions raised by IBM's mid-range product strategy. These include: * What power range will the AS/400 range eventually span? * Which offers the lower \"cost of ownership\", the AS/400 or a an open system machine (which is compatible with that from other manufacturers)? * How should a customer choose between an AS/400 and IBM's own high-powered work- station, the RS/6000, for a mid- range application? Today's AS/400 range can, to some extent, be seen as a exer- cise in catching up with indus- try trends. Digital Equipment, the world's largest minicompu- ter manufacturer, seized the initiative in the 1980s by exploiting what was then a new trend in data processing, \"downsizing\" - the substitu- tion of smaller, cheaper com- puters for large, expensive ones. In a sense, it was no more than an extension of the trend which had seen the rise of the minicomputer in the 1970s to replace the mainframe. But the fact remains that even if customers find they can substitute a smaller machine for a larger one, they soon exhaust their machine's power capacity and seek ones with extra performance. Because Digital's Vax range uses the same operating sys- tem, VMS, from its small :Microvax through to the main frame-like 9000, it is simple for users to increase power while running the same software. Most of the Vax range also runs Ultrix, Digital's version of Unix, the operating system which is quickly becoming the world standard for \"openness\". Digital's initiative caught IBM napping. IBM had a diver sity of mid-range machines of different design and running different operating systems. Because Digital had a single family of easily upgradable and compatible machines, IBM lost business to its rival hand over fist. IBM's response to the chal- lenge was the AS/400 range, a development of its System/38 family, perhaps IBM's most technologically radical com- puter. It was launched with a built-in relational database and \"single level\" storage - which made it easier for users to retrieve information. The introduction of AS/400 also marked a new phase in IBM's relations with customers and software suppliers. Under the avuncular eye of Steven Schwartz, then general man- ager for mid-range systems, IBM consulted with its custom- ers and persuaded software houses to write applications for the new range. Schwartz's success is reflected by the fact that there are some 500,000 AS/400 systems installed worldwide, while the broader mid-range, As/400 undergoing tesung at wnm s nonesner umnnesoia plant. The plant last year won the Malcolm Baldrige award, theUS's premier badge of quality which includes workstations and top of the range PCs, con- tributes about $14bn (equiva- lent to the total sales of the third largest computer com- pany in the world) of IBM's $70bn global revenues and 30 per cent of its net income. Some 9,000 applications pro- grams exist for the AS/400 fam- ilv. However, the mid-range mar- ket has changed. It can now be served by a wide range of machines from networks of powerful PCs to workstations and small mainframes. Cus- tomers are increasingly asking for \"open\" systems which allow them to cut costs and connect machines from differ- ent manufacturers. IBM is try- ing to adapt to the speed of change in this new market. \"Application Business Systems\", as the AS/400 sector is called, is now managed by Robert LaBant, an energetic ard charismatic former general manager of marketing. He reports directly to Jack Kueh ler, IBM president. In a recent interview with the FT, LaBant argued that the AS/400 family now addressed the full range of data process ing applications. The perfor mance of the smallest member of the range, he predicts, will increase by 30 per cent a year (through technological improvements); and the price, he says, will stay at about $10,000. The top of the AS/400 range uses two processors; next year a machine with four processors will be introduced. \"It is built. We are testing it now. I intend to take the AS/400 much higher, adding image process- ing, office functions and artifi- cial intelligence. Over the next six years, I see a 100 per cent annual growth rate in terms of uerformance,\" predicts LaBant. He envisages an eight-pro- cessor engine operating at 200m instructions per second - equivalent to IBM's most powerful mainframe. But he emphasised that even the big- est AS/400s would not replace IBI(s largest mainframes. LaBant believes the physical size of the smallest AS/400 will eventually shrink from desktop to laptop and even to palmtop. On the challenge from open systems, and in particular from Unix, LaBant says, enigmati- cally,: \"Open versus closed; good versus evil. It is an inter- esting discussion.\" LaBant argues that the ini- tial cost of a Unix system may be lower than the AS/400, but over time the Unix and other competitors will cost more, given the level of features already built into IBM's AS/400 machines. \"The operating sys- tem has a lot of built in func- tionality - relational database, systems management and net- working capabilities, security management and print func- tions.\" He has no plans to run Unix on the AS/400. Risc (reduced instruction set computing) pro- cessors are another matter. Rise involves the use of simple, high speed microprocessor chips, which trade off speed against complexity. LaBant is already thinking about using rise processors in the AS/400 family. \"We have three options - we could use a rise processor as the basic engine, as an input/output pro- cessor, or as a co-processor. We are experimenting with an AS/ 400 running in parallel with an RS/6000 chip. We want to see which of our customers might be interested in such a machine. If there is interest we might announce it in 18 months.\" Bond dealers and bankers, for example, would find such machines useful for both data processing and numeric calcu- lations. On the question of which computers to use for particular tasks, LaBant's answer is again well-rehearsed. Where the application is mostly com- mercial, involving a high level of transaction processing with frequent calls to the database, the AS/400 should be the pre- ferred choice. Where work is mainly scientific or technical, the choice should be the AS/ 400. The arguments are persua- sive, but so are the opposing views held by IBM's competi- tors: namely that open system and rise offer greater cost ben- efits. The continuing success of AS/400, however, is critical to IBM's own recovery from the damage inflicted by today's stagnant computer market."

And by next year it will be offer- ing up to twenty times the power (10,000 Million Instructions Per Second). But because the 3600 uses standard Intelt i486 processors, it can offer each unit of power at a tenth of the cost of conventional mainframes. It does so by using hundreds of i486 processors in a massively ...... parallel design. How many is determined by the level of power you need. Later, you can add further 'slices of power' (anything from just two i486 processors up to the full complement). Further features include: * Up to 300 gigabytes of disk storage (over 1,000 gigabytes in 1992); * Imansaction processing in ecess of 1,200 tranactiomns per second next year, * 'aIl system bandwidth of more than 12 gigabytes per second and I/O bandwidth of 38 gigabytes per second; and * More than 380 SCSI I/O channels. At last, this is the affordable power you've been waiting for. Power to enable you to integrate systems, create huge databases, provide image storage, extract real-time infor- mation, and make TP possible on distributed open systems. The parallel design groups between two and eight i486s in an application processor - with a maximum of 32 APs. In this \"share nothing\" design, each application proces- ...............sor has its own memory, own storage, and own operating system. Thus avoiding conflicts. The 3600 can run huge databases of up to 300 gigabytes - that's 15 times the size that will run on a conventional mainframe. And because the 3600 searches its database in parallel, it can provide results 4 to 10 times faster than a conventional mainframe!

Upgrading the processor, by adding a further board to the PC, can often prove as expensive as buying a new machine. With this is mind Acer, the Taiwanese PC maker, has introduced \"Chi- pUp\", a way of upgrading the PC simply by replacing the main processor chip. By prising the old chip away from the printed circuit board and replacing it with the new one the machine automatically takes on the extra power and speed, as the input and output systems have been developed to han- dle the extra capacity.

However, it is hard to see this type of property fund inspiring the same popularity here in the foreseeable future. \"I think it will be some time before it really takes off,\" says Mr David Sproul, a property expert at Arthur Anderson, the accountancy firm. \"We are not as a nation great savers. There is still a lot of concern about where the property market i going. People may be jaundiced by the state of the residential market.\" E BTAL GROWT\"H (%) Retail Office Indutrial All Propertes Year to July 91 0.9 -3.9 2.3 -0.7 Quarter to July 91 -0.5 -2.7 0.1 -1.2 MAonth of July 91 -0.1 -0.7 0.2 -0.3 Invtmnrnt Propty Dahlabnk mm a1m 1 Mr I Aucolm Tibbits, a fund manager for Barclays Unicorn Property Trust, a Â£20m fund which was authorised this week, acknowledges the prot- lem. \"It is more difficult to pro- mote something when there has been a downward move ment in values,\" he says. \"Pe- pie will be mindful of what has happened recently to values. However, the new funds claim that their attraction lies in the assumption that the property market has hit bot- tom. \"The way to invest is counter-cyclically,\" says Mr Chris Laxton, a fund manager behind the Â£58m Norwich Union Property Trust, which was also launched as an APUT this week. \"The small investor usually tends to come in at the top of the market and get out at the bottom.\" Certainly, no one will be buying on the crest of a wave, this time. Since the Norwich Union Property Trust was launched a year ago, with insti- tutional funds, the price of the has dropped from Â£1 to 80.8p. 'This embarrassing fall was largely due to the poor perfor- mance of property company shares, which account for between 20 and 80 per cent of the fund in an effort to ease liquidity. Perhap a greater deterrent is the poor long-term perfor- mance of the Barclays Unicorn Property Trust, which was set up 20 years ago for Barclays' private clients. Its managers say that the fund has kept pace with the average performance of the property market and yet anyone who put Â£1,000 into the Barclays Unicorn Property Trust at its launch and rein- vested the income, would now be able to collect just Â£4,753. The cost of living has gone up sixfold in the period. Although the new funds believe that, by and large, the market has hit bottom, it is hard to envisage a rapid turn- round in the next couple of years. \"It is a long-term invest- ment. We are not expecting a blaze of glory on day one,\" says Mr Laxton. In the short term, income, rather than capi- tal gain, would be the main attraction of the trust, he says. \"We are not putting it for- ward as an alternative to equi- ties,\" he adds. We are trying to sell it as a means for diversif- cation.\" However, after the convulsions of the past year it may be difficult to persuade private investors of property's traditional virtues of stabilt and couater-cycllcallty witn the equityemarket. Private invesitors might also be put off by the lack of enthu- siasm for shown by many pension unds. Indeed, at the same time as Norwich Union is launching its new unit trust, its life fund is rein- ing back its property holdings and has even sold one of its buidin to the trust. Another worry for investors is the illiquidity of property investments. Investors may hark back to 1967 stock market crash, when they found they could not bail out of unit trusts because their funds could not sell their shares fast enough. Property funds may be par- ticularly prone to this to judge by the experience of Rodamco, the world's fourth-largest pro- erty fund last year, when it had to stop buying back shares at net asset value after the nosedive in the UK and Us property markets. In an attempt to overcome this, the Securities and Invest- ments Board, the City regula- tor, insists that only 80 per cent of the funds in the new trusts should be put into prop- erty. Moreover, the funds have the ability to restrict individ- jal holders to 10 per cent of the fund. \"We won't be held to ransom,\" says Mr Laxton.",

   "text_content" : "I int, the grood nw:'-e F rate at which new Soffices are coming onto the collapsing London mnkfe is slowing, writes Vanessa Houlder. In the three months to Junea the central London offic- moqntain grew by 1.5m sqft While this addition is substan tial in itself and brings the ntal available office spe to a record 81m sift it is less than half the rate of increase in e-h of the five previous quar term The bad news Is that the slowdown will not help remove the glut. A report by Debenham Tewson Research, the chartered surveyor, shows demand from occupiers crumb- aing. The central London annual take-up rate is 30 per cent less than a year ago and less than 60 per cent of the 1987 peak. \"If take-up remains at its current subdued level, avail- able offce space will continue to rise over the remainder of this year and into 1992,\" says Debenham Tewson. Vacancies in central London are likely to remain at an unprecedented 16 per cent rate for another year. The City, as usual, has the biggest show of \"To Let\" boards. However, new develop ments will be relatively \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t uncommon for several years, so the present vacancy rate of 18 per cent will probably not be exceeded. The City is Is also competing for tenants with Docklands, which also has a surplus of large office blocks. \"The prog- reps of the Docklands market is hampered by an over-supply of new offices in the City, while the City's position is put at risk by the plentiful supply of quality buildings at low rents in Docklands,\" says Debenham Tewson. In the West End and Lon- don's \"mid-town\" markets, where the vacancy rates are 12 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, most surplus space is second-hand. On the face of It, potential tenants are faced with offers that will not recur. \"Such a wide choice of large, quality units Is unlikely to be repeated within the next 3-4 years, pos- sibly longer,\" says Debenham Tewson. However, relatively few businesses can take advantage of this situation. Demand is shrinking to early 1980s levels because of the recession and a fundamental review of employ- ment levels by many big cen- tral London office employers. Redundancies have afflicted financial services firms, accountants, management con- sultants, advertising agencies, and television staff. Only solic- itors, insurance companies and energy businesses are actively looking for space. Even those businesses deter- mined to move are being frus- trated. Getting rid of a rump of a lease can be difficult at a time of severe property over- supply. \"The fear of incurring doable overheads on accommo- dation costs Is a major obsta- cle to any improvement IL demand,\" says Debenham. The problem is worsening. As rents fall, tenants are increasingly finding they have to pay more than the market rent. They (or their new land- lord) may have to make up the difference if they are to find a new tenant to take the lease off their hands. As a result, the rent price war alone may not be enough to stimulate demand. \"Eco- nomic recovery needs to have taken a firm hold and the risk of double overheads minimised before tenants can respond in volume to the blandishments of very low rents,\" says Deben- ham Tewson.",

   "text_content" : "A Â£Vm contract for a sulphate removal package has been awarded to WEIR WEST- GARTH by Matthew Hall Engi- uqering, on behalf of AGIP, for the Tiffany field.' The plant will remove sul- hates and other divalent ions rom injection water used to enhance oil recovery. The removal of these ions will reduce the tendency of barium sulphate and strontium sul- phate scale to form in the res- ervoir production tubing and vessels. In the past the problem of scale formation has been tack- led by chemical dosing. The new method, based on nano-fil- tration technology, is a mem- brane process developed jointly by Marathon Oil and Dow Chemicals' using FILMTEC NS40 nano-filtration mem- branes. Under an agreement with Marathon and Dow, Weir West- garth has exclusive rights to use the process and mem- branes in North Sea applica- tions. The Tiffany plant will treat 888 cu metres of sea water an hour, working at 75 per cent recovery to produce 666 cu metres an hour (100,000 barrels per day) of treated seawater with a maximum sulphate con- tent of 150 parts per million. The package forms a struc- ture consisting of a base and two upper decks. It uses high pressure pumps and more than 900 FILMTEC NS40 nano-filtra- tion membranes together with conventional cartridge filters. Delivery of the package, designed by Weir Westgarth, is scheduled for January 1992 to meet a critical weather window for the main platform."

   "article_dc_title" : "Asian Art is Flavour of the 1990s",
   "text_content" : "A sian art seems to be / the flavour of the S1990 - an echo of the Japonisme and pas- sion for Chinese blue and white that swept Europe and America a century before. The last few months have seen major museum exhibitions of Indonesian art in the US, and the launch of a Japan Festival in Britain that must rank as the most ambitious arts festi- val ever staged. Next month Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio presents what is billed as one of the most important exhibitions of Japanese art held outside Japan. A more durable expression of late 20th-century oriental- ism, however, is the recent resuscitation and rehousing of three of the world's most out- standing Asian art collections. Hitherto, all three were largely left sleeping in museum stores. The new T.T. Tsui Gallery of Chinese Art in London's V&A enables the museum to display for the first time the whole range of its holdings, notably light-sensitive Tang Dynasty textiles and Imperial lacquer furniture. New annexes at the Musde Guimet in Paris and the Walters Art Gallery in Balti- more not only allow the muse- ums to restore to public view long-hidden works of art of superlative quality, but to pres- ent them more or less as their benefactors intended. Emile Guimet had conceived of a museum of Japanese and Chinese Buddhist art. Such a concept found little support in secular Third Republic France after his death in 1918, and as the museum grew to absorb material from all over South- East Asia, Guimet's own collec- tion receded from view. The French government's enlight- ened acquisition of a town- house beside the museum at No 19 Avenue d'Idna at last provides for the Buddhist pan- theon that Guimet envisioned. The collection amassed in Baltimore by Walters pOre et fils is as eclectic as Guimet's is narrowly focused. William Wal- ters, whose fortune came from railroads and banking, had a penchant for 19th century painting and sculpture, and Chinese and Japanese art. Henry inherited his father's passions, and added to them a taste for Egyptian, medieval and Islamic art. William regu- larly opened his home to the public after 1873. Henry built a handsome neo-Renaissance gal- lery in 1904-9 in which, over the years, the Asian collections found ever diminishing space. By the 1970s, only 150 Asian works of art were on display; some 6,000 languished in store. A solution to the acute space problem came when one of Bal- timore's finest houses, a Greek The Chinese Library in Hackerman House Revival mansion of 1850, was bought by Willard and Lillian iHackerman and donated to the city in 1984. Given the house's proximity to the Walters, it was granted to the museum for use as an Asian wing. A new gallery of \"The Art of India and South-East Asia\" (primar- ily housing the Alexander L. Griswold gift of Thai sculp- ture) was constructed above its mews, and the courtyard link- ing house and museum glazed over to make a lofty, light- filled restaurant. This certainly trumps the V&A's \"ace-caff\". Its approach to presenting Chi- nese and Japanese art is also radically different. In London we find the arte- fact as social history - a func- tional, mass-produced item is as valid a historical document as an exquisite rarity. Aesthet- ics are almost incidental. In contrast, the Walters offers an unashamed celebration of beauty and technical virtuos- ity, a heady attack on the viewer's senses. It is an aca- demically unfashionable approach and it is a triumph. There is no shortage of clear, intelligent information and no one is patronised. One leaves enriched and exultant. The ground floor of Hacker man House retains its domestic character. Something akin to its original curtains, carpets and wall coverings has been restored. The aim is to recreate an impression of a connois- seur's interior c. 1900. Old pho- tographs of William Walters' house provide guidelines to how America's pioneering ori- ental art collectors displayed their trophies, but the clutter of his vitrines is pared down to a coherent richness. The great glory of the Wal- ters' Asian collection is its Chi- nese porcelain: its holding of 18th century Qing is rivalled only by that in the V&A. The grand 60ft long double parlour, called \"The Great China Rooms\", is lined with spare arrangements of choice late Ming and Qing blue and white, cloisonnd, famille rose and famille verte, and garnitures range across the mantelpieces. A feast of variously glazed por- celains graced with 18th and 19th French mounts rise up in a central, Dutch-inspired cen- tral display. The effect is sump- tuous. William Walters' beloved monochrome porcelains glow in the tenebrous \"Chinese Library\". Especially glorious are the rare and subtly mottled \"peach-bloom\" and \"ox-blood\" wares, and fine celadons and white ware. In pride of place is the infamous 8in high Qing peach-bloom vase, purportedly the finest specimen of its class when William bought it in 1886 for the unprecedented and staggering sum of $18,000. To some extent, the honing down of the Chinese and Japa niiese porcelain collections for display lends a misleading and rarified quality to the Walters' acquisitions, which were often bought in bulk and not always with discrimination. Nowhere is this more apparent - even after considered curatorial dis- tillation - than in the realm of Japanese art, and the \"Japa- nese Study\" with its virtual bric-a-brac of arts of Japan 1816-1904. The Walters bought fine late 19th century Hirado porcelains, but they also pur- chased the curved elephant tusk carved with monkeys, the gilt pagoda-cabinet, and -the kitsch carving of a schoolgirl acquired at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Here the collection brings to mind the Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle whose founders were also avid shoppers at the great international exhibitions. Collector's cabinet turns into museum proper after climbing the house's elegant staircase. Rooms are devoted to Chinese funerary objects, exceptional early Buddhist sculpture - including the earliest Chinese lacquered wooden Buddha known to survive - Chinese scrolls, Japanese screens, lac- quers and \"The World of the Samurai\". Both designers and curators must be congratulated for this sequence of perfectly judged installations. I have never seen works of art - notably the inro and Japanese armour - so beautifully pres- ented. Let us hope that the keeper of the antediluvian Ori- ental Museum in Venice is planning a visit.",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "SYMPHONY HALL, BIRMINGHAM Throughout the week the Leipzig Gewandhaus is in residence at Symphony Hall, the first visiting orchestra to make such a commitment to the new audito- rium. It is presenting a cycle of the Beeth- oven symphonies under its Kapellmeister Kurt Masur, before he goes off to New York to conduct his first concerts as the Philharmonic's new Music Director, while retaining his links with Leipzig. On the evidence of Wednesday's pro- gramme the New York public is unlikely to be scandalised by his interpretations, for the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies were placed very centrally in a Germanic per- forming tradition that must have stayed virtually unchanged for the best part of this century. The Leipzig is a solid, sumptuous band, supporting its woodwind instruments with thick cushions of string sound, encourag- ing its brass to a warm, refulgent glow. Combined with Symphony Hall's match- less warmth and transparency the product was often thrillingly vivid, and for the first time in an orchestral concert the auditorium's acoustic doors had been opened to add the benefits of the huge backstage resonating chamber to the sound. But if it created a memorable sonic experience it was one singularly inappro- priate to middle-period Beethoven: just why Masur and his heavyweight orchestra had felt the need for the extra resonance in such repertory remains a mystery. It is not just that the likes of Gardiner, Norrington and Brtggen have demon- strated the increased effectiveness of Beethoven's part-writing when matched to instruments of appropriate scale and tone power, for all the care in Masur's conduct- ing, his concern for rhythmic pointing and decently energetic tempi, the symphonies were generally homogenised into flavour- less textural soup. Woodwind solos had to rise above their accompaniments by sheer force of tone, and inner parts could never be distinguished, and often too it sounded just unidiomatic. The heavyweight expres. sive string lines that intertwined in the slow movement of the Fourth could have settled happily into Dos Rheingold the opening of the scherzo in the Fifth would have been so much more unsettling had the cellos seemed less fulsome, while the fearsome juggernaut launched in the finale of the same work would have brought a late Bruckner symphony home in triumph. In my review of last Thursday's Prom, conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy, I inex- cusably misidentified the orchestra involved* Ashkenazy was in charge of the Royal Philharmonic, and not the Philhar- monia. Apologies to everyone concerned. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "The upturn in the London theatre continues apace. This revival of Thornton Wildr's classic, Our Town, at the Slaf- tesbury is even closer to the ideal production than Ibsen's Hedda Gabler at the Playhowse. Wilder wrote in his preface to the play that his picture of life in a New Hampshire 0-ll lage is an \"attempt to find a value above all price for the smallest events in our daily life\". Although he modestly admitted to drawing a little from Dante, the closest literary analogy is probably with Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. The p ay starts as a comedy; it is an elegy that it ends. But it is a great deal more than that. i Wilder also claimed that; he was making fun of old-fash- ioned playwriting. In this New Hampshire village there areino nervous breakdowns d la Ibsen, only birth, life and death. There is a stage man- ager, played here withi a supreme mixture of relaxation and self-confidence by Alan Alda, to explain that to you. You must, he suggests, remain detached rather than become too caught up with the charac- ters, all of whom are destined for the churchyard in the end. The genius of the play lies in combining two approaches. Most of the characters in Our Town are fully developed. Yet above them there is the stage manager making comments and reminding you of the tran- sience of life. He also makes fun of conventional stage devices, like saying you can have scenery if you want to and it drops from the flies. The large stage at the Shaf- tesbury is ideal for this produc- tion. It is possible to have two households side by side, again with the minimum of props, seemingly living indepen- dently, then for them to coalesce. When it comes to the wedding in the Congregational Church, a suitably modest stained glass window is intro- duced. It is this restrained use of scenery that makes it so effective when it appears. The congregation at the wed- ding sit with their backs to the auditorium; only a neighbour, Mrs Soames (played by Helena McCarthy) keeps up a commen- tary, talking directly to the audience. In a folksy way, she has become for a while the stage manager. The real stage manager is conducting the wedding ceremony. Wilder stressed in his pre- face the importance of num- he in his text. They abound, sometimes comically like mar- ried people having shared 50,000 meals together, but also seriously to show the billions of people who have lived in destiny obscure. The elements Alan Alda Alastair Muir are also there: indeed the weather is seldom far from the text, for it is a play about nature. Alda is, I think, the only American in the cast. A tall man, he moves in the most pleasantly shambling way. He never patronises either the audience or the characters. His performance is gentle through- out, yet at times he commands the stage on his own, even when speaking almost from the wings. He has detachment without arrogance. It is almost incidental that everyone else is English, per- haps even a benefit, since the point is that the experience is universal. Jemma Redgrave stands out as Emily, the girl who dies in childbirth, yet reappears for the third act. Robert Allan Ackerman directs and no-one falls short. As a play, Our Town is in a category of its own. It is hard to imagine that anyone could fail to be entranced. Malcolm Rutherford",

   "text_content" : "MINERVA THEATRE, CHICHESTER Chichester is a place I always rejoice to revisit, but seldom does its theatre offer a play that develops the ideas the place lodges in my head: the historic past and the present, conservation and progress, an idyllic locale and man's work on nature. This new play, however,, draws these threads together. Louise Page has, in fact, written a modem rural gh6st story, with an optimistic ending and this accurate subtitle: \"An evocative love affair between the past and the present.\" A highly awk- ward type of play, I hardly need to remark. Doubts, however, are soon allayed by the sensitive intelligence of Page's writing. Annie, a young woman with a young son, has, after a nervous breakdown, aban- doned a lucrative advertising career. Now, working for her entrepreneur brother Luke, she reconstructs the garden made two centuries ago by the explorer-botanist Richard Stephens. Gardening is her ther- apy; but, when Luke buys the original journal Stephens kept when building the garden, Annie enters so fully into Step- hens's garden and world that she starts to see him; even to converse with him. This doesn't surprise us greatly, because he, his wife and patron have already appeared to us in several scenes. And we see how for Stephens then, as for Annie now, the garden sublimates personal desires and frustrations. Annie's interest in Stephens goes beyond archivism. She understands his ardour to invest in the future; she is, in fact, the very woman of the future for whom he made the garden. And from this she finally learns to invest in her own life. It is not hard to find fault here. Some of the dialectic about \"the past\" and \"the future,\" at once too artful and too heavy, keeps verging on corniness. relationship between Annie and Luke is not at first clear enough; in their first two scenes you could, I think, take him for her (unfeeling) husband. The unhappiness that afflicts Annie is left far too vague. Still, the play's virtues easily carry the day. Here are some of its more remarkable feats. We always see both how the char- acters see themselves and how they look to others; in particular, we can be caught up in Annie's visions and yet still see how crazy she might appear to others. We can interpret (as in Tmrn of the Screw) the scenes between Stephens and Annie as real phenomena or as the intense projec- tions of her neurosis. The writing of the late-18th-century scenes is remarkably natural, with only a few anachronisms. At present it works mainly like a good radio play. This is largely because the black backdrop of Paul Farnsworth's designs (otherwise admira- bly economical) fails to conjure up any sense of outdoor place. The cast is a fine one. Sharon Maugham (she of the Gold Blend couple) is an attrac- tive Annie, though too temperamentally normal; a dash more neurosis and individ- uality would heighten matters considera- bly. As Stephens, Simon Dormandy is out- standing, with just the nervous intensity and commanding personality I mean. Some of the best writing goes to the sec- ondary figures - Stephens's unhappy wife, Annie's difficult little son, and the gardener Mr Hodgkiss - roles played with finesse by Petra Markham, Alex Scott and Geoffrey Freshwater. Caroline Sharman directs, and must be largely responsible for the naturalness with which this tricky stage endeavour succeeds. I found Adam was a Gardener utterly absorbing. Its central dilemma - large- ness of spirit versus personal anguish - strikes home with delicacy and with force. Alastair Macaulay",

   "text_content" : "BUSH THEATRE The new plays so far provided by this decade have been a pretty earthbound lot, so it is with a frisson of excitement that one witnesses a new young writer unfurl- ing his wings; it is impossible to tell yet whether they will prove capable of long- haul flight, but at least they have lifted him, and us, above the imaginitive rut into which the fringe seems to have trundled itself. James Stock's first play A Pricksong for the New Leviathan, premieted at Isling- ton's Old Red Lion in 1989, established him as a promising new presence; his third, produced under the patronage of Barclays New Stages, is a richly imagined, chaotic and scurrilous look at one of the cardinal tensions of our age: between the drifters and the stay-at-homes; the former often in futile search of a better life; the latter armed with shotguns to keep newcomers out. It is a global issue, but Stock does not generalise, reducing his canvas to a hap- less Scots laddie, bent on self-betterment, and the Iowa outback to which an ill wind blows him in search of the promised land. Leaving behind the cosy mythology of his Scots ancestry (a reeling spectral grandfa- ther who scorns his attempts to claim heri tage by wearing a kilt), Andrew clings to the shears that are the tools of his garden- ing trade. After losing all his money in an elabo- rate New York heist, he arrives in a small- town US which disowns its daughters for the incest it licences in its sons. Ingen- uously, he blunders into a community madness - of mutilation, self-abuse and illicit consumation - which adds echoes of Peter Greenaway's films to a splat of references ranging from a reality-warping Wizard of Ok-style cyclone to distorted lines from the poetry of T.S. Eliot. It is not always easy to keep up with it all, but Stock has a clever knack of deflect- ing irritation with moments of irrisistible humour, often based on strikingly percep- tive observation. The New York heist, for instance, is no ordinary mugging, but a confidence trick involving a phony Polish down-and-out, masquerading first as a corpse, and then as a destitute seller of religious icons who just happened to be taking a nap on the sidewalk. The absur- dity of the situation reveals the absurd vulnerablity of the cultural outsider whose codings are adjusted so as to make it impossible for him to imagine that such an apparently vulnerable figure could be a racketeer. This deflationary humour is finely sus- tained by Sallie Aprahamian's direction, which allows poetic interludes - such as the repeated presence of a languid dancer behind a gauze - to co-exist with brutal images of death and decay. She has a filmic ability to focus in from a big scenes to something as small and detailed as the human hand, writhing in a single spot- light. The performances are superb, grainy, committed, from Matthew Zajac's likeable ingenu, to Virginia Radcliffe's lovely manipulator; from Lynne Verrall's grim- faced matron to the primitive sexuality of Tom Mannion as her farmer son. Where it all gets us I'm not sure, but it is certainly far from the beaten track. Claire Armitstead",

   "text_content" : "THE WEST is in some danger of repeating with the Soviet Union the mistake it made in Yugoslavia; namely, throwing its weight behind a political structure which is doomed because it no longer enjoys the confidence of the peoples it was supposed to serve. Such a course of action would be not only futile but damaging. It would waste precious time, when the problems faced by the Soviet peoples are acute and urgent. It would arouse anti-western feelings by mak- ing it seem to those peoples that the west was trying to prolong their subjection for reasons of selfish convenience. Above all, it would ensure that western arguments for the maintenance of specific eco- nomic ties between the ex-So- viet republics - arguments which are sound, and crucially important - would not get the hearing they deserve. Statements to the effect that it is a western interest to pre- vent the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which trip almost automatically off the tongue of many western politi- cians and diplomats, need to be rethought and rephrased. Clearly it is a western interest that the dissolution of the Soviet Union should not bring about an addition to the num- ber of nuclear powers, in breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But that danger is already in the process of being averted by the concentration of Soviet nuclear weapons on Russian territory. Orderly separation There must also be a general interest, which the west shares, in preventing the for- mer Soviet Union from subsid- ing into generalised anarchy or large-scale civil war. But that is not synonymous with pre venting its dissolution. Indeed, a peaceful and orderly separa tion into sovereign republics would be far preferable to any attempt to hold the Union together by force. But, while the ex-Soviet pec ples must be free to dissolve the Soviet polity, the incipient dissolution of the Soviet econ omy spells certain disaster. Of all the former Soviet republics, Russia alone could contemr plate autarky with even a degree of equanimity. If other republics are not careful they will find their factories closed and bills for their imports of oil and gas in hard currency and at world prices. They will then experience an economic collapse dwarfing anything so far. Fortunately, they have a solution. A high degree of eco- nomic integration is compati- nomic relationships is, how- ever, the answer only to the Soviet Union's problems in the longer run. First, it has to manage the transition. The assets and liabilities (including foreign liabilities) of the Soviet state will have to be divided. The budgetary and monetary disarray of the Soviet state will have to be sorted out. Basic goods will have to be procured and distributed over the com- ing year or two. The only way to meet such challenges nors through the closest possible co-operation. Even in optimal conditions, the ex-Soviet peoples will need expertise and resources which only the west and Japan are then a position to provide. The west must offer both, but only on the understanding that mini- mum conditions for economic self-preservation will be met. This means that the west must accept devolution of power to the republics - just as ict should encourage the transfer of economic decisions to the marketuts must also make it clear that it will not subsid- ise ill-considered moves towards republican autarky. The precedent of the Mar- shall Plan has been much invoked. It is indeed relevant, because the main significance of the Marshall Plan was the stimulus it gave to European economic co-operation and the dismantling of intra-European barriers. \"It is evident,\" said General Marshall when he launched the plan in 1947, \"that before the US govern- ment can proceed much fur- ther to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on the way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to the r irc ements of the situation\". The west should say the same today about the ex-Soviet republics. ex-Soviet republics. ble with independent curren- des, fiscal policies and armies. As the European Community demonstrates, this can be secured by the operation of the market within each state and free trade and currency con- vertibility among them. It would evenbe possible for the republics to have indepen- dent trade policies towards the rest of the world (like members of the European Free Trade Association). It would also be possible for new republican currencies to float vis-d-vis one another. But it would not be possible for them to be incon- vertible into one another; nor could any currency be convert- ible into those of the rest of the world while the others are not.

   "text_content" : "IF ONLY it were possible to criticise the UK government's transport policy; but this would be stretching the word policy too far. A collection of ill-considered and short-sighted initiatives has emerged from the Department of Transport over the last decade. The gov- ernment has circled Britain's transport problem, as if it were taking a day-trip on the M25. It goes round and round, but gets nowhere. The London Underground is one of the main victims of this non-policy. A recent Monopo- lies and Mergers Commission report blamed its deficiencies on \"chronic under-investment\" by successive governments. It called for investment spending of Â£700m to Â£750m a year just to halt the deterioration, almost double its current level. Ideally, it said, this would be government-funded. Sec- ond-best would be a rise in fares. The government response, announced yesterday, is to do nothing, precisely the approach that caused the mess in the first place. Moreover, it refuses to let the London Underground do anything either. There will be no increase in planned public investment - the Treasury's horror at subsidising revenue- generating public services has seen to that. Neither will fares be allowed to rise. Short-terI expediency Short-term political expedi- ency is preventing a rise in fares. The government, it seems, has a low opinion of the electorate. Most Tube travel- lers are voters; and yesterday's decision ensures they will sti fae broken ecalmtrm es tion and the nmilar stenci.

Sadly, the Treasury is wilihf tolavet In new rus h but nto e mieta the curnat r2s. Yet thie is little chance that widening the M25, or any other road, will ease the daily jams. Another lane means more space for cars to crawl. But congestion is a wasteful way to regulate road use. Much better to make users bear the cost of their trips, including the pollution they impose on others - while keeping traffic flowing. Policy mistakes These are just two in a long line of policy mistakes; the fal- ure to invest in British Rail and the myopic refusal to pro- vide adequate links between the Channel tunnel and the rest of the country are two more. The decision to deregu- late and privatise London buses will, in isolation, add to the problems of congestion on London's streets. Privatising buses, building more roads, and raising taxes on company cars does not add up to a trans- port policy. The government's failure is partly one of vision, partly of ideology. It is not possible to consider congestion n n rods, buses and trains as separate problems, as provisin one area clearly aIcan otherl s The speed and ease of public transport directly affects the number, and aver speed, of cars and lorries.

   "text_content" : "Eastern Europe is knocking on the EC's door. David Buchan and David Gardner look towards a Community of 24 - or more European Community Marting at the Atlantic and stopping not too far short of the Urals no longer seems a ri hypothesis. Indeed, IMr Frns Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, warned the EC this week it should begin thinking about how to adapt its insti- tutions to cope with 24 member states. \"f we take into account what's happening in the Soviet Union, this [number] might even increase,\" he It would of course be far-fetched to suggest that the heart of the old Soviet Union -' Boris Yeltsin's far-flung Russian republic, which stretches to the Pacific - might apply for EC membership, and even more absurd to suggest that such an approach would be accepted in Brus- sels. But other bits-of the old Union - not only the Baltic states - might one day knock on the Community door for admission. What is certain is that the EC is now broadening and deepening its approach to the east more than ever before. In the process it is piling up political and moral commitments, from the Balkans to the Baltic, and exciting aspirations in ways that will powerfully influence its future mem- bership, its trade and agricultural pol- icies and the outcome of its present constitutional wrangling on,political and monetary union. These are some of the longer-term consequences of the Community's new approach to the east, on which the Twelve hold a for- eign ministers meeting today and a possible summit in mid-October. The big question on everyone's mind is help for the Soviet Union. The Community will play a central role. This is not because of the size of the aid it has pledged collectively, which is dwarfed by that of several of its member states, notably Germany. It is more because it has given the largest pledges of technical aid (Ecus 400m - Â£279m) - to the energy, financial, food distribution and transport sec- tors - and this will probably be the most valuable form of assistance to the Soviet Union. Only the Commu- nity, too - as its sole big and wealthy export market - can offer the com- mercial concessions through which the Soviet Union can trade its way to modernisation and economic health. None of this Community effort con- fers any EC obligation to take in break-away republics. But if the Ukraine, adjoining four east European countries with clear aspirations to join the EC club, were to apply, it would be hard for Brussels to laugh the application off as blithely as it did that of Morocco a couple of years ago. Take the Soviet republic of Moldova (formerly Moldavia), too. It wants to join Romania, which in turn wants to join the EC. One of the purposes of Mr Andriessen's visit to the Soviet Union next week is to see whether republi- can leaders want some sort of direct relationship with the EC. A small beginning to such links may come with the planned visit by Soviet republics' economics ministers to Brussels next week. For the moment, however, the most direct consequence of the failed Moscow coup has been the catalytic effect it has had on the west's rela- tionship with eastern Europe. Nato, as well as the EC, has been jolted out of complacency. For months, east European leaders visiting Nato head- quarters in Brussels had received tea, sympathy but absolutely no formal commitment to their security. After the coup, however, Nato issued a statement declaring eastern Europe's security \"inseparably linked\" with that of the Atlantic alliance. Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, attacked the Community's hypocrisy, as well as complacency, towards eastern Europe. \"It's no good making fine speeches with a sob in your voice on Sunday, and then on Monday morning oppos- ing the trade concessions enabling those countries (in eastern Europe) to To IC US .Iapn LI r EC US Japan 41.5 -iLI EC U5 IDI S-EU EC US Japan 10 .20 -2222 EC US Japan 5.1 2. 4.5 EC US Japan 13A 40.7 EC US Japan 9.5 hA 43.3 sell their goods and improve their liv- ing standards.\" Today the Commission will put ministers to the test by asking them to approve dramatic trade concessions on sensitive products that would enable it to bring to a conclusion association agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. These would involve: * Phasing out all curbs on textiles from these three central European countries within six years. * Asking Germany and Spain to end their national restrictions on Polish coal imports within four years. - Reducing by 60 per cent over three years the tariff levels on imports of central European meat, fruit and veg- etables, with the quantity of imports to rise by 50 per cent over five years. Such concessions, far bolder than anything EC ministers were ready to accept earlier this summer, would silence the justified criticism from the central Europeans that the EC was only offering free access to products that they could not sell in the west. Agriculture is one of the few areas where eastern Europe has a clear comparative advantage. Scottish strawberry and raspberry growers - to take one example - may complain of unfair competition from Poland, but there is nothing underhand about the fact that Poland's costs in grow- ing soft fruit are two thirds below the UK's. Where the EC is aiding eastern agriculture, further nonsense arises. \"We are in the indefensible position of giving Hungarian pigfarmers money to make them more productive, but shutting out the pork they produce,\" says one EC farm official. The main block to eastern farm exports is the EC's own vast food mountains, the result of structural overproduction running at 20 per cent over Community needs. For example, live calves coming into the Confnu- nity from eastern Europe rose from 307,000 head in 1988 to 853,000 last year, with Poland, the main exporter, raising its earnings from $153m to $280m in desperately needed hard cur- rency. But faced with a record beer mountain and collapsing prices, the EC in April cut the import quota for the east in half. At the time, Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commis- sioner, argued that the removal of price subsidies in the reforming east had led to high food prices and a huge drop in local consumption, and that the EC could not cope with other peo- ples' surpluses as well as its own. Set Mr MacSharry is hinting now that the eastern onslaught on the common agri- cultural policy - constituting much more acceptable pressure than that from Washington in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotia- tions - is just the kick-start he needs to get his wider CAP reforms under- way. If the latest concessions get through the Council of Ministers, the commission then intends to turn the tables on other members of the Group of 24 western aid donors which have done less to help east Europe's trade balance than the EC (see chart), and demand they match the EC effort. But central Europe's galloping expectations of what the Community can do for it are far from just eco- nomic. In a letter last month to the Dutch presidency of the EC, Presi- dents Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, Lech Walesa of Poland and Prime Minister Joszef Antall of Hungary have asked if their countries can be included in some way in the process of European Political Co-operation by which the Twelve co-ordinate their foreign policies. Seeing in this a response to his idea of affiliate EC status for countries not yet ready to assume the economic responsibilities of full Community membership, Mr Andriessen backs the central Euro- peans' request. But if the idea of afiliate status was designed to put off the day of full membership for the central European states, the strategy clearly is not working - any more than Austria or Sweden were dissuaded from applying for EC entry by the current negotia- tions to include them in a so-called European Economic Area. Fresh evidence of the central Euro- peans' eagerness to press ahead came this week when Poland proposed to re-draft the preamble of its planned association agreement. Before, Brus- sels had reluctantly agreed that the preambles in these agreements should record Poland's - and Czechoslo- vakia's and Hungary's - aspiration to EC membership. Now, Warsaw wants this to state that both sides - Poland and the EC - believe the agreement will pave the way to Polish entry. If Poland gets its way, then it will set a precedent not only for Czecho- slovakia and Hungary, but also for Romania and Bulgaria. For this week, the Commission pronounced these two Balkan countries far enough down the road to pluralist democracy and a market economy to deserve similar associate status. Others may travel the same path. The Commis- sion says Albania now merits a basic trade agreement, and Mr Andriessen has the same idea in mind for the three Baltic states whose representa- tives he will meet in Tallinn, the Esto- nian capital, on Sunday. Having been the first big power to recognise the Baltic states' independence, the EC seems to have accepted a moral responsibility to see that 8m Baits can make it economically on their own. The same logic would apply to Slo- venia and Croatia, if peace efforts were to fall and the EC were to recog- nise their secession from Yugoslavia. In those circumstances, membership applications from break-away Yugo- slav republics would be impossible for Brussels to duck. Yugoslavia is the east European country with which it has the longest relationship (since 1970), and the society and economy of Slovenia is near the level of northern Italy and Austria which it borders. Lying behind the rush by Brussels to cast its net so far and wide across eastern Europe is the growing fear of instability, the knowledge from the 1930s of what an awful mixture nationalism and economic depression can produce. Nationalism is not only rife in the Soviet Union and Yugo- slavia, but also stirring in the Slovak republic of Czechoslovakia and never far from the surface in Hungary. The EC's answer to these difficul- ties is to suggest that the east Euro- peans and Soviets keep some sem- of integration, both for their own good and for the Community's, so that they do not throw themselves on Community charity. The problem is that east Europeans are not in very federative mood. When Mr Delors preached, on his two recent visits to Moscow, the virtues of Soviet economic and monetary, if not political, union, his words were ignored by everyone except President Gorbachev. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strongly-stated call on Wednesday for Soviet unity may go equally unheeded. Last year Brussels suggested temporary creation of a hard-currency union to stop trade flows plummeting within the former Comecon area, and was told by the east Europeans that this was an unac- ceptable attempt to keep them within their old geo-political straitjacket. So, the Community seems fated to get membership applications from the east, which after 45 years of state- ments about the importance of over- throwing communism it will find hard to refuse. This is what makes plausi- ble Mr Andriessen's prediction of a Community of 24 by 2000. The idea of such a populous Com- munity is bound to raise a new debate about the EC's future institutional structure. Mr Andriessen is not alone in believing a much larger Commu- nity would be ungovernable without a far greater degree of supra-national- ism than is being discussed among the Twelve's political union negotia- tors. This may be theoretically cor- rect, if a Community of 24 were to maintain the same level of collective ambition as the Twelve. But in prac- tice a larger membership might do fewer things in common; even within the Twelve, the growing likelihood of a two-speed move to economic and monetary union is a pointer to less uniform arrangements in the future. With hindsight, the Twelve should have told their political and monetary union negotiators to tackle the issue of enlargement. But to do this now would bring the intergovernmental conferences (IGCs), more than half- way through their allotted timespan, to a halt. The best thing now is to finish the business in hand, sign a new EC treaty no later than Decem- ber, and prepare for the next constitu- tional revision in a couple of years' time.",

Sir, What is the standard reply to those of us who argue that unemployment at 3m (on the OECD definition) is an appalling and unnecessary blight on our society? The reply is that we can do nothing about it, now that we are in the exchange rate mechanism. They are saying the same thing all over Europe - in France, Spain, Italy, Greece. minister after minister is on record with the same pro- nouncement: \"We are terribly sympathetic to the unemployed (the standard Michael Howard line), but the ERM means that nothing can be done.\" Each minister is afraid that reflationary action will lead to a capital outflow, and his coun- try's exchange rate will then drop out of the bottom of the mechanism. The ERM seems quite likely to lock most of Europe, east and west, into a permanent state of high unem- ployment; the east as well, because the low demand for labour in western Europe means that there will be very little trickleover into the old Warsaw Pact countries. It is certainly more difficult now (though not impossible) for any single European coun- try to return to full employ- ment on its own. Collective action is needed. The European Community should formally adopt full employment as a major objective of policy. The European Parliament - and Particularly the European - should take up this issue much more vigor- ously. So should the European trade union movement. Full employment was, for more than 20 years, one ato the great triumphs of post-war European capitalism. The states of Europe, if they act togetha, can re4staiish this basic human right the right to worL Frank Blackaby, 9 PclimM Bona 9im~hSW"

   "text_content" : "Andrew Adonis and jai-Uwe ( compare the merits ao te German and British education systems ha to facete fact thatgd mintake us, under thebest Ca-: ditians, between 20 and i0.years (at a moderate computation) to remodel our secondary and Aigher education, and to put ourselves on a level with the Germans. During that period Germany herself is not likely to be idle. Board of Education, 1902 Ever since Wilhelm von Humboldt created Prus- sia's state education sys- tem in the wake of Napoleon's military conquests, the British have cast jealous eyes on Ger- man schools. They do so now more than ever. Her Majesty's inspectorate recently issued a report on why German tradi- tions of state regulation and skill training have produced a system of vocational education superior to Britain's. The envy is not all one-sided: Germany has its own discon- tents, particularly in higher education. On both sides, how- ever,* deeply-rooted attitudes and institutions make conver- gence a fraught endeavour. An overview of Anglo-German practice in five areas - voca- tional training, 16-19 education, universities, the teaching pro- session and education policy- making - will show why. * Vocational training. Each year about 550,000 German school-leavers sign apprentice- ship contracts with companies. ::very Gennan profession has its own training programme, lasting for two to three years, and all companies employing apprentices must conform to it and hire qualified instructors. Under the so-called \"dual system\", trainees generally work three days a week and spend the other two in voca- tional school, where almost half their time is devoted not to their trade but to classes in maths, German and general studies. Trainees earn only about DM200 (Â£70) a week, which makes the system palat- able to the 500,000 mostly medi- um-sized and large companies, about a fifth of the total, which offer training places. Local chambers of commerce accredit instructors and organ- ise the standardised exams which trainees have to pass to qualify. Britain's fledgling Training and Enterprise Coun- cils, and its morass of voca- tional qualifications which few study, are pale imitations. The dual system is costly: employers spend about DM50bn a year on training, and though most recognise its necessity, there is some grum- bling about cost and inflexibil- ity. The system is tightly regu- lated by statute, but government largely confines itself to giving legal force to training programmes negoti- ated between employers and unions industry by industry. Efforts are made to keep train- ing up-to-date while avoiding over-specialisation. The dual system is not easily exportable. \"To introduce a system like this by law is com- pletely unrealistic,\" says Mr Karl-Georg Krachten of the German Employers Associa- tion. He points to the long Ger- man tradition of skill training, which has led to different organisational structures in German and British compa- nies. \"We need much less divi- sion of labour because our workers have a broader range of qualifications to start with.\" It is, nonetheless, glib simply to dismiss differences between the two countries with the word \"culture\". Technical edu- cation flowered in 19th-century Germany at the behest of determined state direction. \"Bismarck made the employers pay, and they resisted at their peril: it wasn't all a response to cultural urgings on their part,\" says Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, the Anglo-German sociologist. * 16-19 education. Germany's traditional tripartite school system - Gymnasium for the academically-oriented, Real- schule and Hauptschule for the vocationally-directed - has survived largely intact despite efforts by social democrats to promote the comprehensive ideal. Almost 90 per cent of British state secondary pupils attend comprehensives: only 5.7 per cent of German pupils do so. By contrast - but not by co-incidence - private schools, which educate almost a fifth of all British sixth-for- mers and a quarter of univer- sity entrants, are peripheral in Germany. The Abitur, gained by most Gymnasium pupils at the age of 19, is the standard qualifica- tion for entry into German higher education. In their last two years, pupils generally concentrate on two core sub- jects, but also study six others, which must include two from German, maths and a foreign language, plus history, at least r ~a~p- one science, art or music, and physical education. Early spe- cialisation is avoided, and con- tinuous assessment, including oral contributions in class, count towards the final grade - both in a stark contrast to A-levels, the so-called \"gold standard\" of the British sys- tem, to which Conservative ministers remain attached. Gymnasien command greater social prestige than Realschu- len (the equivalent of R A But- ler's technical schools-that-nev- er-were), with Hauptschulen bottom of the heap. But the latter have nothing like the \"sink school\" reputation of the old British secondary moderns, and anyway the last two decades have seen numbers attending them almost halve. = Universities. These are the weak link in German educa- tion. They are mostly over- crowded, inefficient and dispir- iting for students. University courses last an average of seven years (compared to 3.3 in Britain); with military service thrown in, a typical male stu- dent is 28 or 29 at graduation (21 in Britain). And German doctorates? A passage to the grave, goes the joke. True, German first degrees are at British masters level: but the difference is not worth four years. On the other hand, Britain's universities could ill afford their luxurious student/ staff ratio of 11.3, were they invaded by the half million extra students needed to match German levels of participation - particularly if a similar pro- portion followed capital-inten- sive science and engineering courses. * Teaching profession. Like all German professions, teach- ing is a rigid and hierarchical affair. In Britain, virtually any giiduate can move inio teaefi toft contae h, ; suthhir subject plus at college or uni- verity, and the whole process mkes a minimum of five years. The status of teachers is far ingher in Germany. A second- ary teacher with six years' experience earns. about D>M31,000 (21,000), along with ll the petks that go w'i their status as a civil servant. In Britain, by contrast, a high-fly- lag teacher can expect about Â£16,000 after six years - barely two-thirds of his or her White- hall fast-stream counterpart. Teachers have jiust been given an independent salary review body, but it will take more than a pay rise to restore teaicher morale. * Education policy-making. Under Germany's federal con- stitution, education is a state (Land) responsibility. While Mr Kenneth Clarke reigns ever more absolutely over Britain's schnools, Mr Rainer Ortleb, the Bonn education minister, can encourage, warn, and must be consulted, but decision-making - and, crucially, funding - lie with state parliaments; each nas its own education minister. Education is one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of state elections. Yet behind the sound and fury, stability and a high degree of consensus apply in practice. Per capita education -pending is more closely aligned between west-German states than between English local education authorities. A conference of state education ministers regulates key issues, like mutual recognition of each state's Abitur. With its stand- ing secretariat, the conference is also an important forum for policy debate, and a far less secretive one than the Depart- mont of Education in London. Some west German states (such as Hessen) have experi- mented more than others, but in none could a Kenneth Baker impose controversial tests on all seven, 11 and 14-year-olds, or a Shirley Williams decree away all grammar schools. For all the German social demo- crats' love of comprehensives, electoral and coalition exigen- cies, inter-state treaty obliga- tions and resolute opposition from parents and the conserva- tive parties have kept them at bay everywhere except Ham- burg and Berlin. Reproducing the west's edu- cation system in the east is Germany's main preoccupation for the 1990s. Meanwhile, sim- ply to envy German education may profit the British little; but an understanding of its strengths and weaknesses could help them set their own schnools in order.",

   "text_content" : "From Ms Jo Richardson Sir, Your report (\"High price of a minimum wage\", Septem- ber 4) refers to the latest study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It ignores, however, one of the study's major con- clusions: that a large number of women would gain from its introduction and that it may well be an effective tool in pro- moting equal pay. The IFS study gives support to Labour party estimates that nearly 80 per cent of gainers will be women. And nearly half of all gainers will be women part-time workers. Nor do these estimates take account of the 3m workers - mainly women and mainly part-time workers - who are earning below the PAYE threshold. They are, in fact, currently ignored by official government statisticians. Women's wages still lag far behind men's with the gross earnings of full-time women still only representing 68 per cent of men's. The relative position of the growing num- ber of female part-timers is actually deteriorating. If our economy is to function effectively, we can no longer afford to undervalue and under-reward women's work. All too often, low pay is linked to women's work and is a prod- uct of discrimination rather than low skills. A national minimum wage is an essential part of the strat- egy for creating the conditions for fair pay for women and dealing with the glaring inequalities in existing pay structures. So, too, is strengthened and revitalised sex discrimination and equal pay legislation and improvements in childcare and community care. They are the policies that women want and that the economy needs if it is to com- pete successfully on the basis of quality skills, low staff turn- over and high productivity. Discrimination continues to waste the skills and potential of women. It is the cost of allowing it to continue that should concern all those who wish to see a successful and vibrant economy.

   "text_content" : "From Mr Robert K Young. Sir, As one of the \"few stan- dard rate FT readers\" referred to in Mr Owen's letter (August 10) in response to Dominic Lawson's attack on tax, I can only despair. It is the custom and ritual b:oth in our courts and tax sys- tem that misleads us into believing that we are actually seeing justice being done. The effect on revenue of higher rate taxes is not small - it is negative. Mr Dominic Lawson's worth is irrelevant. A high earner automatically contributes more. More in stan- dard rate tax on his earnings and savings. More on VAT on his expenditure and, assumingrr he can accumulate assets, more in inheritance tax on his death. In all justice he contrib- utes in good measure to soci- ety. Higher rate tax is ritualised envy and a pernicious attack on endeavour with no basis in justice. It would be more equitable and raise more revenue if tax reduced after a certain level of income. We could all aspire to become lower rate tax payers to the benefit of all. Company cars and the like would cease to be provided as \"perks\". The financial services Indus- try would concentrat on ro viding real benefits instead of devising \"tax dodges\". The incentive to work and produce more eficiently would give the country the injection it needs. More tax revenue would then be raised to help those in so-:- ety who have no choice about whether to work or sit back; people like the old, sick, men tally handicapped and din- Perhaps then success would cease to be considered as anti- social as public spitting.

   "text_content" : "Mr John Major has eight weeks in which to make the most impor- ment of his remarkable piolitical career. If he gets it right he may be able to stay in No 10 Downing Street until the end of the century. If he gets it wrong the most remarkable thing about his political career will have been its brevity. The decision he must make is now well-known. Does he stand up at the Conservative party con- ference in Brighton on Octo- ber 11 and announce there will be a general election on November 7 - or does he duck and weave and hold on for May 1992? In spite of this week's stock market fizz, which is partly based on fan- cies that there will be a snap election and a fourth Conser- vative victory before the year is out, the balance of argu- ment is still in favour of May 7, which would coincide with next year's local elections. November 7 has its attrac- tions. It would herald the first anniversary of the day on which the then little-known Mr Major astonished the country and many parts of the world by succeeding Mrs Margaret Thatcher. It would precede the Maastricht meet- ing of European Community heads of government, and thus postpone any Tory or Thatcherian revolt against a compromise deal on European union. The new prime minis- ter would at last be free of the ghost of his predecessor; he could exercise the unique powers of a British prime minister and base his claim to the right to do so on a demo- cratic mandate. At present he is a Gorbachev, put in power by his party; following an election victory he would be a Yeltsin, put in power by the voters. These Russian analogies serve to remind us of one rea- son why the British prime minister seems to be doing so well. He is good at getting himself advertised on televi- sion. At the start of the sum- mer it seemed the Labour party had the monopoly of news management skills, as it presented one domestic policy initiative after another, then went back to the beginning, rqcycled, and started all over again. Mr Major blessed four close colleagues with the task of breaking this opposition monopoly. They did well. But it was the former Soviet Union that squashed the image of the formerly socialist Labour leader flat. Thebungled coup of August 19 has thrust world statesman Major on to the screen and kept him there. A makeshift podium outside the door of No 10 has become his personal soapbox, unless he is on tour. Then the backdrop is Wash- ington, Kennebunkport, Moscow, Beiing, Hong Kong. These televisual visits are not stunts: Mr Major has been travelling as current chair man of the G7 group of indue trial nations or, in the case of China, as head of the depart- ing colonial administration of At present Mr Major is a Gorbachev, put in power by his party Hong Kong. But no opportu- nity to be photographed shirt- sleeved and smiling, doing and saying the right things, has been missed. The prime minister showed how good he was at this kind of thing dur- ing the Gulf war. Now he has even managed to turn the grubby business of shaking hands with the murderers of Tiananmen Square into the anpearance of a positive act of foreign policy, partly by get- ting his deal on the Hong Kong airport, and partly by making sure that his pro- nouncements on human rights were heard. There could be an addi- tional explanation for the lat- est change of British political mood. The crumbling of the Soviet coup demonstrated that the most important state power, more powerful than tanks, is what is going on inside people's heads. Now the nightly television onslaught on the ashes of everything socialist in what was the Soviet empire may be having its subconscious effect on British public support for a Labour party that, for all its reforms, still labels itself socialist. Add up the above items, throw in the latest couple of polls (which indicate a rise in support for the Conserva- tives), tack on Wednesday's cut in base rates and cheaper mortgages, conjure up a self-fulfilling prophecy of a resurgent economy based on a growing public confidence and willingness to spend, and the case for November 7 seems compelling. The cautious Mr Major will know better. It is the polls that count, and a solid lead that counts most. My office has been compiling a weighted average of the results of all published opin- ion polls, month by month - call it the FT poll of polls. The weighting is by sample size, the dates are sampling dates. The print-out shows that a Labour lead of 12.3 percentage points in August 1990 was reduced to a lead of 3.8 in August 1991. This is good for the Tories, but not good enough. The sharpest change - a rightwards swing of nearly 9 points - came last December, following the depo- sition of Mrs Thatcher. The Gulf war kept the Conserva- tives marginally ahead until April, but they have been behind all summer. The gain- ers have been the Liberal Democrats, who stand to gain further from publicity for their conference next week. All these are good reasons to hesitate. The conventional wisdom is that a three-month run of good leads for his party is required before a prime minister can safely call an election. Questioning for last Sunday's Mori poll in The Sunday Times ended on August 27, so, private polls apart, the most Mr Major could have to work on on October 11 would be about six weeks' of sampling. All of it would have to show greater leads than Mori's two points for a decision to go to the polls on November 7 to be sta- tistically sound. In short, the case for an election this year rests on the proposition that the economy and therefore the Conserva- tives will be worse placed next year. If the polls sud- denly soar Tory-wards and give, say, an average lead of five or six points from now on that proposition may be hard to gainsay. But in any other conceivable circumstance a 1992 call could be the making of Mr Major, 1991 his down- fall."

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussels and Laura Slber in Belgrade A DECISION on whether to go ahead with tomorrow's planned peace conference on Yugoslavia's future will be taken today by European Com- munity foreign ministers. In spite of the escalation in fighting, the Dutch presidency of the EC insisted yesterday that the Community intended to proceed with the conference in The Hague. However, Lord Carrington, who is to chair the weekend peace talks, called for an end to the fighting before the con- ference - the first of its kind to be held under EC auspices to discuss events outside the Community. He said leaders of the Yugoslav republics would not be able to talk sensibly about the future while fighting continued. The final decision on whether to proceed will be taken in Brussels today, when the EC foreign ministers meet to discuss closer relations between the Community and eastern Europe. In Yugoslavia yesterday, Serb paramilitary units fired mortar rounds at Osiek, the capital of eastern Croatia, and other towns in the region, and the death toll in the last two days of fighting in the area rose to at least seven. For a second day, Serb mili- tants manned roadblocks which sealed off Osijek's popu- lation of 158,000 from the rest of Croatia, and forced the clo- sure of the main motorway linking the Croatian capital Zagreb with Belgrade, the Ser- bian and federal capital. In spite of the fighting, all the Yugoslav parties - includ- ing Serbia - have now accepted their invitations to the conference, the Dutch pres- idency said. EC diplomats yesterday made clear their expectation that the political bead of steam which had led - at Tuesday's foreign ministers' meeting in The Hague - to the clear majority among the Twelve for an early peace conference, would still be evident today. The Dutch, who currently hold the EC presidency, sup- ported by the UK, had argued on Tuesday that EC monitor- ing of the ceaseflrb agreed last weekend would need to be effective to make a conference feasible. But the majority, grouped around Germany, Italy and France, prevailed with the view that any delay would dis- sipate the political momentum for settlement. It was privately expected that further violence would precede the conference, as both the Serbs and Croats sought to reinforce their bar- gaining positions. Increasingly strident Ger- man threats to recognise the independence of Croatia and- Slovenia unless talks go ahead have strengthened the likeli- hood that the conference will open tomorrow. The first 25 of 200 EC moni- tors prescribed by the ceasefire agreement were expected to reach Zagreb last night. In Brussels, the European Commission released a sym- bolic Eculm (Â£690,000) in emer- gency aid for the victims of the Yugoslav fighting. Eastern approaches, Page 14",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomklns, Transport Correspondent LONDON Underground will not be allowed to introduce big fare increases to raise money for badly needed investment in the network, the Department of Transport announced yester- day. It also ruled out the possibil- ity that it would make up the difference by doubling central government grants. London Underground said some extra cash could be released through efficiency savings, but not enough to pre- vent the system deteriorating still further without extra cash from fares or grants. The department was responding to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on London Underground which blamed serious deficien- cies in services on \"chronic underinvestment\" by succes- sive governments. Its response came the day after the government's announcement that Â£2.8bn is to be spent on widening and improving the M25 London orbital motorway to cope with growing congestion. The monopolies commission report, published in June, said London Underground saw the need for investment of Â£700m- Â£750m a year for the rest of the decade to provide an accept- ably modern network. Current levels of investment are roughly half this figure. Given the fierce competition for scarce government funds, the commission said, it would be unrealistic to expect the government to pay for this investment. It concluded that the gap would have to be bridged by increasing fares beyond the rate of inflation. London Transport wants big increases in Underground fares, but it has been pre- vented from introducing signif- icant increases in real terms because of the possible politi- cal consequences. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said yes- terday that Underground fares had risen in real terms by 2% per cent a year over the last six years and the government was not convinced that there was a case for them to rise more steeply. He said the Transport Department and London Underground would work together to devise a 10-year strategic plan setting out safety, efficiency and quality- of-service targets.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy LONDON Weekend Television, producer of programmes such as Poirot and Blind Date, has been significantly outbid in the tenders for new commercial broadcasting licences. LWT, which holds the Lon- don weekend franchise and is one of the \"big five\" ITV net- work production companies, bid less than Â£30m a year for the 10-year licence to run from the beginning of 1993. LWT's only rival, London Independent Broadcasting, a consortium led by PolyGram, the record company controlled by Philips of the Netherlands, bid Â£35.4m at 1990 prices. This means that three of the big five - LWT, Granada and Thames - have been outbid. Of the other two main compa- nies, Central judged that it was unopposed and bid just Â£2,000 a year and Yorkshire Television defeated two rivals with a bid of about SÂ£3m. The Independent Television Commission will decide if there are exceptional circumstances to justify setting aside the highest cash bid The winners are due to be announced next month. Signs are growing that the rrC is placing great empha- sis on quality and could exclude some applicants. This should give Granada and LWT a better than average chance of survival despite being underbidders. It also means that TVS, the ITV com- pany for the south of England, which bid nearly 60mm a year in 1993 prices, is likely to have its business plan looked at closely. Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive, indicated this week that the regulatory body is preparing to take a rigorous line. He said in a letter to the Times: \"No one, least of all the ITC, supposes that these judg- ments will be easy since they amount to a much more sophisticated exercise than opening the brown envelopes and identifying the highest cash bidders for each licence.\" He added: \"If that had been the criterion laid down by par- liament the ITC would have announced the licence winners the day after the applications were received.\"",

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "IBy Guy do Jo jquires, -ndrew Jack and John Thornhill LEADING British food and retailing companies yesterday backed a plan to relieve food shortages in the Soviet Union, but many said the government would have to provide further substantial funding if the plan was to have much impact. Mr John Gummer, agricul- ture minister, and Mr Peter Li- lev, trade and industry secre- tary won the support of 40 senior executives to send experts to the Soviet Union to study ways improve the supply system. \"It is the whole of the food chain we are concerned with. You have to make sure that every link in that chain works if food is to get to the consumer,\" Mr Gummer said. Sir Ronald McIntosh, chair- man of the British Food Con- sortium, an alliance of compa- nies with interests in the Soviet Union, will lead a seven- member industry team to Rus- sia and the Ukraine in the next few days. A further five or six teams will later prepare more detailed studies The teams will study har vesting, processing, storage and distribution. Assistance may include technology trans ser, training, exchanges and providing experts to work alongside Soviet farmers. The studies will be financed by the British government's Â£50m Soviet \"knowhow\" fund. However, many companies involved said concrete action to tackle food shortages would require substantially more gov- ernment money. The two min- isters announced no plans for extra funding. Many companies said they were willing to provide person- nel, training and expertise. But few seemed prepared to com- mit large-scale financial or manangement resources. Lord Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, said: \"Our main contribution will be sensible ideas. We have no intention of investing in the Soviet Union. We are wholly committed to our existing investments in the UK and the US.\" Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive of Dalgety, the food manufacturing company, said: \"We would be ready to put for- ward some individuals to help and bring people over here to train. But it depends on money being made available. It would not be practical in terms of the returns available for a com- pany like Dalgety to put any significant funds into this.\" Mr Colin Berry, a director of Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank which helps arrange fin- ancing for investment projects in the Soviet Union, said: \"This is but the first step. The ques- tion that now needs to be addressed is how will this lead to substantial capital invest- ments. Either some form of investment insurance or guar- antees will have to be forth- coming.\"",

   "article_dc_title" : "Drawing the Line at Btr",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "BTR must regret that its current bid for Rockware pre- vented it from discussing trad- ing prospects yesterday. There was thus little to distract attention from its decision to take the profit from its Pretty Polly sale straight into the profit and loss account. This is arguably permissible under current accounting rules because BTR is a group whose business involves buying and selling other companies. But it is conventional to carry such items below the line. Without the boost interim pre-tax prof- its would have been Â£90m lower at Â£422m, a perfectably reasonable result for these recessionary days. BTR's approach appears to reflect April's draft proposals from the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) which seek to remove the distinction between exceptional and extraordinary items. If so, this only shows how much longer the debate needs to run. From the invest- ment point of view, such treat- ment makes for an unpredict- able profits flow. It also leaves unanswered the problem that arises with goodwill. The ASB still prefers goodwill on acqui- sitions to be written off through reserves, rather than passed through the profit and loss account, but that could seriously inflate profits on dis- posals that are taken above the line. The Pretty Polly sale is also striking for the low value of Â£20m at which it was carried on BTR's books. Assuming its similar conservatism in valu- ing other assets, gearing, at 44 per cent, looks overstated. That in turn makes interest cover of ten times less surpris- ing, and confirms the scope for BTR to go on the big acquisi- tion trail. With yesterday's fig- ures and the steep price he is paying for Rockware, Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, has scarcely endeared himself to investors already impatient on that score. That explains why the shares ended a net 1 per cent lower on the day. Reckitt & Colman The style may be lacking; the substance from Reckitt & Col- man is as solid as ever. Hence perhaps the market's continu- ing love affair with its shares. The truth from yesterday's interim results is that reorgan- ising Europe and digesting Boyle-Midway in the US have not proved as straightforward as management hoped. Admit- tedly, Reckitt set itself a formi- dable time-table and has stuck to it. Group margins improved despite higher spending on Ft-1 57I Shanr FT~^ 110 100 90 80 70 Soufo marl taxi highi ings provi thee As look, have way, of Â£ unde despi genei ings Â£100i Sbe ter, nattu form and eyel brani fertil cash, cals ingi core ness, with Procl basis fully Sui: Inves aboul mort after Sun . hole idly i BAT' revei ingli Give) kets; to ca defici could they Sui cent ately that and with FT-S Index: 2 3 (-1.) Share price relative to the FT-A AII-Share Index tax:Datatm marketing. But while the pre- tax line survived the effect of higher interest charges, earn- ings were held back by further provisions and the coupon on the capital bond. As for the immediate out- look, currency movements have been going the wrong way, so much so that net debt of Â£358m will probably be undented by the year-end despite the usual heavy cash generation. Next year borrow- ings should drop by at least Â£100m. Shareholders would do bet- ter, though, to consider the nature of the feast. Reckltt has formidably strong businesses and is running them with an eye to the long term - the brands will always need to be fertilised with large chunks of cash. With the pharmaceuti- cals division gradually becom- ing indistinguishable from the core household products busi- ness, Reckitt should be rated with the likes of Unilever and Procter & Gamble. On that basis, its shares are more than fully valued. Sun Alliance Investors are not much wiser about the likely scale of UK mortgage guarantee losses after yesterday's figures from Sun Alliance. The latest black hole for the insurers was viv- idly exposed last month when BAT's Eagle Star subsidiary revealed first half underwrit- ing losses of more than Â£120m. Given Eagle's 18 per cent mar- ket share, outsiders were quick to calculate that the industry deficit for this type of business could top an alarming Â£ibn for the year. Sun, which has a 20.25 per cent market share, immedi- ately countered expectations that it had been similarly hit and duly came in yesterday with a mere Â£50m underwriting r I I loss for the same period. Part of the difference is probabl due to the better quality of its lenders, part maybe explained by the size of Sun's unearned premium reserve (premiums collected but not taken into the profit and loss account). The discrepancy still looks odd, though, when both companies' numbers appear to have pro. vided for their share of build- ing society repossessions, as well as firm claims. Besides speculating what Legal & Gen- eral may serve up next week, the market will doubtless pon- der Sun's interim dividend pay- out. A 5 per cent rise is hardly commensurate with the com- posite sector's premium rating. Burmah Castrol Burmah always admitted that acquiring Foseco would be mildly dilutive; but it can scarcely attach that label to yesterday's 18 per cent reduc- tion in first half earnings. Trading profits from Foseco fell by more than a fifth, against a forecast for half that at the time of the bid. Add in the negative effects of an ineffi- cient tax structure, and the acquisition will continue to look slightly less than clever until the economy rides to the rescue. The attraction of Foseco last year was the knock-down price Burmah could pay for a strate- gic diversification. It can per- haps be forgiven for not pre- dicting just how bad its markets would become - only Castrol managed a resilient performance. But the second half will have to be strong indeed if management is not to be left with some egg on its face. Burmah shares have lost nearly a fifth of their value rel- ative to the market since the start of last year. So far, there are few signs to justify a rever- sal of the trend. Blue Circle Blue Circle is another com- pany whose experience holds out little hope of recovery in the broader economy. UK cement deliveries have stopped falling but continue to run 16 per cent below their last year's level. Careful control of costs and efficiency gains will help earnings rebound when recov- ery does finally come. Mean- while, the balance sheet is strong, with comfortable gear- ing of 32 per cent. With good demand in overseas markets, this lends the shares a curi- ously defensive quality, though the historic multiple of 12 means there may not be much excitement in the short run.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Bolger BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate, Infuriated City analysts yesterday by hang its accounting policy to produce much higher than expected proit figures. The reported pre-tax profits of Â£512m In the six months to June 80, were well above most fore- casts. However, BTR included in the profits a gain of Â£0Om from the recent disposal of its Pretty Polly hosiery business. Mr Alan Jackson, BTB's new chief executive, said the com- pany had decided to show the results of disposals In a new seg- ment of trading profits called corporate activities. This reflected the group's stated intention to become a more active trader of assets and was also in line with proposed new accountancy standards. By taking the profit from Pretty Polly above the line, BTR showed a 1.2 per cent increase on last year's interim profits, adjusted for currency move- ments. If the impact of the dis- posa were taken out, the pre-tax was down 11.2 per cent. Analysts contended that BTR had Jumped the gun by using the new approach, which is still under discussion and is not expected to take effect until Easter, according to the Account- ing Standards Board. The board alms to solve the debate over whether individual gains or losses should be treated as exceptional or extraordinary - and thus be treated above or below the line - by putting practically all transactions through the profit and loss account. BTR shares rose Op to 438p when the figures were first announced, but fell back quickly and closed at 424p, down 5p on the day. Apart from the row over accountancy policy, the results were well received. Turnover dropped to Â£3.29bn from Â£8.S2bn, adjusting for exchange rate movements, but earnings per share rose to 17.4p from 16.7p. The interim dividend was lifted to 7.5p from 7p. Mr Jackson said despite depressed conditions, a number of group businesses increased profits and return on sales was 17.6 per cent, after Including cor- porate activities. Trading profits from construc- tion plunged to Â£67m from Â£180m and the industrial busi- nesses were down to Â£85m from Â£102m. However, consumer-re- lated businesses saw profits rise to Â£16m from Â£164m. Lex, Page 16 BTR Nylex, Page 23",

   "text_content" : "By Richard La pp rj SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest composite (general and life insurer) yesterday announced a 50 per cent increase in mort- gage indemnity premiums from October. Underwriting losses of Â£50m from mortgage indemnity busi- ness - in which Sun Alliance is the market leader - contributed to overall Interim pre-tax losses of Â£114m. This was only marginally bet- ter than the Â£119m loss last yar when results were heavily influ- enced by the storm losses of Jan- nary and February, indicating a serious undedIyh deteriorantion.

For Courtaulds Textiles, with flat profits, UK trading conditions had been the worst \"for a decade.\" Blue Circle, with profits down 38 per cent, reported that its UK cemert sales had dropped a sixth from the year before. Sun Alli- ance, reporting losses of Â£114m, blamed unemployment and the housing market for losses of Â£50m from residential mortgage indemnities. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, said Britain's weather and the \"deep recession\" had held profits to a 5 per cent increase. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's group chief executive, talked of \"gener- ally depressed market condi- tions\". The company reported a 1.2 per cent rise in profits, thanks to a controversial change in accounting policies. BTR said it had cut jobs by 11,400 in the year to June. At Booker, 900 jobs went in the first half, with 400 more to go. Cook- son, where profits fell 76 per cent, has shed 1,000 UK jobs. Companies evidently believe the worst is now over in the UK. \"There is now evidence that the general recessionary conditions may have bottomed, and there are tentative signs of recovery,\" said Cookson. Mr Martin Taylor of Court- aulds Textiles pointed to lower inflation and interest rates, and the fact that \"consumer confi- dence, while still fragile, is no longer visibly deteriorating.\" There was no great optimism over the immediate outlook, how- ever. \"An immediate and vigor- ous recovery appears unlikely\", said Courtaulds Textiles. Blue Circle said it expects \"very diffi- cult conditions\" in the UK \"for the rest of 1991\". And Booker's Mr Jonathan Taylor said that although there had been some upturn in business in the last few weeks, \"I suspect that is weather- related rather than a return of consumer confidence.\"",

   "text_content" : "New Brent Walker executives puzzled by second allegedly forged letter By Robert Peston THE discovery of a secbnd allegedly forged letter and a dis- pute over more than Â£5m in com- mission payments lay behind the decision by Brent Walker's direc- tors to ask the Serious Fraud Office to investigate the group. The Serious Fraud Office is examining payments of between Â£5m and Â£6m made in 1989. Brent Walker's records say these payments were to Mr Mich- ael Eland, a Paris-based property dealer. The company found a letter, apparently signed by Mr Eland, which was in effect an invoice for more than Â£5m in commissions. Last month, Brent Walker's directors led by Lord Kindersley, who became chairman in Janu- ary, confronted Mr Eland with this letter. He disowned it. He agreed the signature was his, but said he had not written the letter and not received the payments. Investigations by the compa- ny's auditor, Peat Marwick, found the commissions appeared to have been transferred to one of Brent Walker's offshore subsid- iaries and then through a net- work of subsidiaries. There was no evidence the pay- ment had been made to Mr Eland. Lord Kindersley and his new executives were puzzled by the payments because they were much bigger than other commis- sions paid to Mr Eland on other occasions. The payments also seemed disproportionately large compared with the value of the service Mr Eland appeared to have provided. One payment was for almost Â£3m and was described in company documents as a com- mission for arranging a Â£5m investment in US property. Mr George Walker was chair- man and chief executive of Brent Walker when the payments were made. He told the FT yesterday he did not remember Mr Eland's letter but added that a lump sum was paid to Mr Eland to cover several pieces of business intro- duced by Mr Eland to the com- pany. Mr Walker added this pay- ment was approved at a full board meeting. Last month, at the same time as the company was confronted with the mystery of these com- mission payments, it received reports from two forensic experts that another letter, apparently signed by the Irish property entrepreneur, Mr Robin Power, had been forged. The two alleged forgeries and the possibility that Brent Walk- er's 1990 interim results were overstated form the platform of the SFO's enquiry. But it is also looking at Brent Walker's pur- chase of Power Corporation shares at the end of last year, when Power's share price was falling sharply. Mr Walker said that Brent Walker had invested around Â£lm in Power shares in November and December. The shares were bought through the company's Dutch subsidiary, Brent Walker Overseas BV.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE severe recession in UK and US construction markets sent pre-tax profits of Blue Circle, one of the world's biggest cement manufacturers, tumbling by 38 per cent to Â£57.5m during the first six months of this year. Turnover fell to Â£530.8m from Â£656.4m as demand from the building industry continued to decline. Mr Jim McColgan, chief execu- tive, said cement sales in Britain during the first half fell by 16 per cent as the effects of the recession in the construction industry widened. Cement and concrete sales by Blue Circle subsidiaries in the US fell by about 12 per cent after taking into account new acquisi- tions. Sales were down by more than 20 per cent in some states, said Mr McColgan. Blue Circle, which produces just under half of all cement sold in Britain, is the one of the world's largest producers. The company recently diversi- fied into household products in the UK where it manufactures boilers, bathroom and kitchen products. Last year it acquired Ceramica Dolomite, the Italian sanitaryware manufacturer. UK cement profits during the first half fell by 45 per cent to Â£20.4m from Â£37.2m. UK prop- erty development profits fell more sharply from Â£6.6m to just Â£500,000 due mainly to the tim- ing of development sales expec- ted in the second half of this year. In the US, profits from cement, concrete and aggregates fell by more than two thirds to Â£1.6m. The Atlanta market in Georgia, where Blue Circle has struggled in recent years, is expected to pick up as construction work begins for the 1996'Olympics, planned for the city. Elsewhere cement profits in Malaysia, experiencing a sharp increase in construction, doubled from Â£1.5m to Â£3m. Profits in Chile held steady at Â£6.1m but dipped slightly in Africa from Â£9.3m to Â£8.1m. Home products rose by a quar- ter to Â£23.4m thanks to a first- time contribution from Ceramic Dolomite. The group's balance sheet remained strong despite an increase in net debt from Â£262m at the end of last year to Â£316m at the end of June. Gearing at the end of June stood at 31.9 per cent. The company has declared a maintained interim dividend of 3.75p. Lex, Page 16",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Sara Webb THE TREASURY yesterday demanded cast iron assurances from the three contenders for the position of US lead man- ager in the British Telecommu- nications sale that they have never been involved in any practice which could embar- rass the UK government. Following the sacking of Salomon Brothers, after the disclosure that it had rigged recent US Treasury Bond issues, the iK 'Treasury yester- day began to put the three pre- vious finalists, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, through a due dili- gence test. The Treasury's in-house solicitors and legal advisers to the sale, Linklaters and Paines, demanded written assurances from the banks that they have never partaken in any action which could affect their abil:ty to sell the BT shares. All three are considered ads quate replacements for Saloe mon Brothers. According to government advisers, the win ner will be the bank which proves it is \"whiter than white\". The UK government is not expected to make a decision until next week. Although Goldman Sachs has been regarded as the favourite to succeed Salomon, government advisers were said -o be impressed by the fact that Mr William Schreyer, Mer- dll Lynch's chairman and chief executive, fl1w from New York to conduct his company's nego- tiations personally. According to government advisers Goldman Sachs did not help itself by the late dis- closure of its holding in Max- well Communication Cornor- tion (MCC), which represented a technical breach of the UK Companies Act. Goldman said it regretted the omission. The main concern of the UK Treasury is if it should emerge that one of the houses being considered as US lead manager in the BT sale also participated in rigging the US Treasury bond market. The Â£5bn BT sale is due to take place in November."

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harvereon in New York SALOMON BROTHERS, the embattled Wall Street Securities house, announced last night that it would not be paying compensation or legal expenses to the four senior executives who resigned over the Treasury auc- tion-rigging scandal that has engulfed the firm. The decision, taken by a special board meeting, means that millions of dollars in the form of compensation, severance pay, bonuses, or ofilce and legal expenses will be denied to Mr John Gutfreund, the former chairman, Mr Thomas Strauss, the former presi- dent, Mr John Meriwether, the former vice chairman, and Mr Donald Feuer- stein, the former chief legal officer. However, Salomon said that if the four executives were ultimately found to be entitled to indemnification under law, then the firm would honour that ooligation. Yesterday's decision is a big blow to the former Salomon bosses, all of whom earned million-dollar salaries last year. They will be ineligible for the hefty severance pay and compensationi package that would normally have been offered to them. They will also be deaied any profits- related bonuses for this year, which, baed on Salomon's record first half earnings of $451m, would probably have been substantial. In addition, Mr Strauss, Mr Meri- wether and Mr Feuerstein will not enjoy a share of the $100m deferred-pay pool due to be distributed to 115 man- aging directors early next year. Salomon's refusal to pay legal fees could also prove costly. The four have been named, along with the firm, in a number of lawsuits filed by investors and Salomon shareholders who claim they were defrauded by firm's actions Salomon stocks or options held by the four executives, however, are not. thought to be affected by the board's decision. Mr Gutfreund currently owns Salomon shares worth $31.2m, and Mr Strauss owns stock worth $18.5m. Although Salomon never stated it would pay compensation and legal expenses to the four, the firm had left the possibility open. The decision to deny the payments is seen as another attempt by Mr Warren Buffett, the new chairman, to distance the firm from everyone Involved in the scandal."

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay SAATCHI & SAATCHI, the troubled advertising group which will run the Conserva- tive Party's forthcoming elec- tion campaign, yesterday reported a slide into losses after a fall in revenues in all its main markets. The pre-tax profit of Â£13.5m turned into a loss of Â£4.2m in the six months to end-June on sales 4 per cent lower at Â£352.8m compared with Â£367.8m. The decline was by and large expected, however the group's pessimism about pros- pects for advertising rev- enues caught analysts by sur- prise. In spite of signs of recovery in the US economy, which accounts for over half of group revenues, Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman, said that would not feed through into the service sector before the second half of 1992. A number of analysts low- ered their forecasts for 1991 pre-tax profits from about Â£12i to some Â£2.5m as a result of the company's gloomier-than-ex- pected prognosis for ad- vertising revenues and mar- gins. The loss included Â£14.6m of finance charges on debt that stood at Â£206m, down from Â£15.7m as a result of a fall in borrowings and lower interest rates. The group expects debt to be broadly unchanged at the year- end. Losses per ordinary share were 1.7p for the six months compared with losses of 3.7p in the six months to March 1990. Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, changed the group's year end to coincide with the calendar year to bring its budgeting process into line with that of its clients. Again there will be no interim dividend. 'The shares eased %p tc 15'/p. The group made a Â£60m pro- vision against future rental lia bilities of property surplus to requirement, for the closure or operations and for other provi- sions. This was more than offset by the surplus arising from the group's financial restructuring in April which involved the redemption of europreference shnares at a discount to book value. The result was an extraordi- nary gain of Â£40.8m. At a trading level, profits fell from Â£28.5m to Â£10.6m. On the communications side profits halved to Â£6.6m in the US, while in the UK profits of 23.5m turned into losses of Â£900,000. In the rest of Europe profits were down 27 per cent at Â£7.4m (Â£10.1m). As a result the tax rate increased to above 100 per cent of profits."

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox BOOKER, the food distribution and agriculture group, was held to a 5 per cent rise in interim profits as the recession held back catering sales. It has also announced its first acquisition on the Conti- nent, with the purchase of 40 per cent of Jeronimo Martins, a Portuguese cash-and-carry business, for Â£13.6m. Pre-tax profits to the end of June rose to Â£37.8m (Â£36.1m) on turnover of Â£1.56bn (Â£1.28bn). Fitch Lovell, the food pro- ducer and distributor acquired last year for Â£302m in cash and shares, contributed little after finance charges. Earnings fell to 13.01p (14.76p) because of shares issued for Fitch, but the interim dividend is raised to 7.5p (7.25p). Increased interest payable of Â£12m (Â£7.5m) reflected debt assumed to buy Fitch. Despite tough trading condi- tions in food distribution over- allthe cash-and-carry operation and its other suppliers to cater- in improvedl ales. Food distri. bution trading profits were Doosted to Â£18.3m (Â£12.9m), mainly by Fitch businesses. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chiei executive, said conditions had Improved recently, but \"it is three weeks of sunshine not a recovery.\" Agribusiness profits fell 17 per cent to Â£10.9m (Â£13.2m) and health products slipped to *3.9m (Â£4.4m). Disposals worth Â£51.2m in the first half brought the total to Â£125m since the Fitch deal. T\"his reduced gearing at the half year to 95 per cent, from 111 per cent last December. First-half disposals yielded an extraordinary net profit of 215.1m. Booker plans to cut jobs by 400 to 22,000 in the second half, after losing 900 in the first half. * COMMWNT Buying Fitch to get at two thirds of its businesses was never going to be effortless. Picking a year of high interest rates increased the pressure to make disposals and job cuts, though the debt load is no bad thing if it has accelerated Booker's overdue tidying up. The strategy seems right, if laborious. It should leave Booker well placed as food dis- tribution consolidates. Immedi- ate recovery looks elusive. Hillsdown and others share Booker's message that falling interest rates have not yet fed through to more demand for catering. Analysts yesterday trimmed their forecasts of full- year pre-tax profits from about Â£117m to Â£112m (Â£103m last year). But the potential for a 1992-93 bounce in profits still looks good, particularly if the company switches successfully from building market share to profits. Booker, along with other food stocks, has been left behind during the recent rally. While the shares may be dull ahead of the important Christ- mas season, with a 6 per cent prospective yield they are hardly expensive.",

   "text_content" : "BJy Milchlyo Nakamoto A REDUCTION in interest charges helped Courtaulds Textiles produce a moderate increase in interim pre-tax profits despite a near-10 per cent fall at the operating level. In what Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive, described as \"the most difficult trading con- diitions for a decade in the UK textile and clothing markets\", profits improved to E16.6m (Â£16.4m) in the six months to June 30. Continued tight cash man- agement combined with the positive effects of last year's substantial reduction in bor- rowings, brought interest charges down to Â£3.3m (Â£5.8m). Turnover fell to Â£451.6m (Â£480.9m) while operating prof- its were down to Â£19.9m (Â£22m). The interim dividend is increased to 4.2p (4p), payable from earnings of 12.3p (11.9p). Both the clothing and fabrics businesses suffered a down- turn in turnover and operating profits. However, in fabrics sales of lace continued strongly in international markets. In its spinning operations, losses were trimmed by about Â£100,000 and a further four mills were closed. By region, North America made the only increased contri- bution, with operating profits rising to Â£6.9m (Â£5m). * COMMENT Since its demerger from Court- aulds, the textiles group has shown no small talent for cash management. Having slashed borrowings significantly last year, it has gone one step fur- ther in continuing to reduce interest charges by forging ahead with cost-cutting mea- sures, including tight stock controls. Meanwhile it is steadily improving returns on capital by moving out of less profitable businesses. The upturn for Courtaulds, when it comes, may not be as pro- nounced as for other more vul- nerable businesses, but, on the other hand, the group has a reputation for responding quickly to changes in its envi- ronment. A p/e of 16, on full- year profits forecast at Â£42m looks high, but for the resil- ience it has shown, the pre- mium makes the shares at least a strong hold."

Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said the Gulf crisis had dampened activity and caused stockpiling of lubri- cants in late 1990. \"The first quarter was the worst in my 14 years with the company.\" Trading profit rose to Â£96.5m (Â£91.5m), affected by a Â£5m adverse currency cost. Interest paid amounted to Â£24.3m (Â£12.3m). Turnover was Â£1.16bn, nearly 40 per cent up on the corresponding period. Burmah bought Foseco, the speciality chemicals and abra- sives producer, in December. It contributed Â£15.3m to trading profit and Â£269.4m to sales. Mr Urquhart said that because the associated interest costs were more than Â£18m, the net effect was to knock Â£3.7m off pre-tax profit. The Foseco acquisition also had an adverse effect on the tax rate, which rose to 47 per cent (40 pez cent), UK borrow- ings had 'ought overseas earn- ings and low UK pre-tax profit had led to a higher ACT write-off. The transfer of debt overseas would ease the prob- lem. The cheniicals side increased trading 'profit to Â£21.4m (7.5m). Foseco's metallurgical chemicals had been established as a separate division, while Fosroc was' merged with, the existing conistruction and min- ing chemicals operation. Abrasives, diamond products and UK industrials, represent- ing Â£150m annual turnover and Â£75m net assets - between a quarter and a third of the acquisition - were up for sale. In lubricants, trading profit slipped to Â£58.7m (Â£60.3m), although Castrol was 5 per cent ahead on constant exchange rates. Profits in fuels fell to Â£9.4m (Â£1.1m), as UK drivers cut on petrol consumption in the recession and the petrol station property market dried up. Disposals reduced shipping to Â£6.7m (Â£9m) and energy investments to Â£4.3m (f6.8m). Gearing came down from 60 per cent at the year-end to 56 Lawrence urqunarr: nrs qurner me worsr in 14 year per cent, or 71 per cent includ- ing convertible bonds as debt. Before the Foseco acquisition, the group had had cash in hand after selling its stake in Premier Consolidated Oilftelds for Â£138m. Earnings per share fell 28 per cent to 17.8p (24.7p).

Sharp rise at British-Borneo Announcing pre-tax profits up from Â£705,000 to Â£1.66m for the six months to June 30, Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director of British-Borneo Petroleum Syn- dicate, said the company had participated in 23 exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico, of which 11 had encountered pro- ducible hydrocarbons. Oil and gas production achieved sales of Â£1.12m, against Â£11,000 with profit on dealing activities and invest- ment income increased to Â£1.95m (Â£1.38m).

Ex-Lands almost wipes out losses Ex-Lands, the security invest- ment group which owns and deals in real estate, reported a sharply reduced loss for the year to June 30. At the pre-tax level the deni- cit was Â£8,000 after exceptional costs of Â£68,000 in connection with abortive acquisitions.

The previous first half saw losses of Â£138,000, but the out- come for the full 15 months period to December 31 1990 was Â£415,000 profit. Turnover in the period under review rose to Â£6.93m (Â£2.04m), mainly as a result of acquisi- tions. Earnings worked through at 0.33p per share (losses 0.26p). Porvair moves ahead 11.5% to Â£670,000 Porvair, the USM-quoted microporous plastics specialist, reported an increase of 12 per cent to Â£670,000 in pre-tax prof- its for the six months to May 31 on turnover ahead from Â£7.65m to Â£7.7m. After a tax charge of Â£165,000 (Â£4,000), earnings fell to 42p (4.9p) but the interim dividend is increased from Ip to L.p. Goldman Sachs cuts Maxwell holding Goldman Sachs, the US invest- ment bank, sold 5m ordinary shares in Maxwell Communica- tion Corporation on September 2.

The previous 12 months saw losses of Â£1.llm. Mr Richard Beecham, chief executive, said the second half, traditionally the stronger period, should see a significant contribution from products featuring the Simpsons cartoon characters.

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy A COLOURFUL Canadian venture capitalist specialising in \"difficult stock\" has taken a 5.9 per cent stake in TVS Entertainment, the ITV com- pany. Peter Cundill and Associ- ates, a Vancouver-based com- pany which manages two Ber- muda mutual funds, has amassed the hareholding over the past few months. Mr Cundll,; who divides his time between London, Vancou- ver, New York and San Fran- cisco, is one of the best known mutual fund operators in Can- ada. He once told shareholders at an annual meeting that they paid him to \"rape and pillage.\" Mr Cundill has decided that TVS is now undervalued. TVS has bid Â£54.1m a year at cur- rent prices to try to retain its franchise for the south and south-east of England. The company's share price has fallen from a high of 345p several years ago to its present figure of about 28p. TVS ran into financial prob- lems because of the $320m acquisition of MTM, the US independent programme production company that made Hill Street Blues. Earlier this year TVS failed to find a buyer at a price of about $70m. The TVS share price has fallen further in recent weeks because of uncertainty over the size of its bid and whether it will retain its hotly con- tested franchise. Peter Cundill has accumu- lated the shares at prices rang- ing from 50p to 28p, almost certainly less than the break-up value of the com- pany.",

   "text_content" : "uy Roland RLudd COOKSON, the industrial materials group, suffered a 76 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Â£71.4m to Â£17m in the six months to June 30. Mr Robert Malpas, chairman, said that against the back- ground of recession and the effects of the Gulf war, together with last year's crisis, when the acquisition pro gramme pushed gearing over 120 per cent, the results were \"commendable.\" After restating the 1990 fig ures to exclude the tioxide and graphics businesses which were sold in the second half turnover fell by 16 per cent from Â£806.6m to Â£675.9m. Group operating profit declined by 49 per cent fromr Â£60.7m to Â£31m. Interest charges dropped to 214m (3S.sm). A series of disposals sharply reduced last year's debt of Â£635.4m to SÂ£24.7m. Sharehold- ers' funds have increased from Â£417.9m to Â£514m. Gearing, on a debt to equity basis, fe from 129 per cent to 48 per cent. Mr Malpas said the strength of Cookson's balance sheet showed that it was no longer the \"debt-ridden basket case\" of last year. Earnings per share, after adjusting for the recent rights issue, were O.9p (11.1p). The company's confidence of an upturn in the performance of its businesses, particularly in the US and the Far East, is reflected in the maintained interim dividend of Sp. This will be paid by taking Â£8m from reserves. A rationallsation programme has lead to the loes of 2,000 jobs, of which half were in the UK. Mr Richard Oster. group managing director, said he did not expect another \"massive reduction\" in the workforce. The group's ceramics busi- nesses were badly affected by the recession. In plastics, the specialist businesses in Amer- ica have performed better. * CONMENT Mr Malpas is right to claim that Cookson is no longer the \"basket case\" it was last year. But it is still not clear whether it should be viewed as a recov- ery stock. The decimation of its profits should beset against four encouraging signs: the unchanged dividend, a much stronger balance sheet, reduced fixed costs and evi- dence of an upturn in the US. A sirgnficant profit increase - which would also help offset surplus advance corporation tax of Â£2.8m - is unlikely until 1993. If operating margins are pushed up to about 10 per cent on expected sales of Â£1.5bn, Cookson should be making profits of about Â£150m within two years. This would put the shares on a prospective multi- ple of 8. It looks promising, but there are still a lot of ifs."

The deal, announced inprin- dpe yesterday, is Mr Henry Clarke's biggest step yet towards achieving his ambi- tion of creating a worldwide ice-crea company. In February, he transformed Yelverton Investments, the USM-traded Investment com- pany, into Clarke Foods through the purchase of three ice-cream plants from Hills- down Holdings. With annual sales of Â£53m, about three times Clarke's existing turnover, Lyons Maid accounts for 15 per cent of the UK ice-cream market and has 25,000 UK outlets. Clarke plans to retain Lyons Maid's plants at Greenford, Middle- sex, and Kirkby, Merseyside. The combined group will rank second to Bird's Eye Walls, the Unilever subsidiary. Lyons Maid's brand names will be included in the sale, but Allied-Lyons will retain Baskin-Robbins, its US-based ice-cream subsidiary. The purchase price was not announced, and Mr Clarke said his company had not decided how the deal would be flaanced. If additional equity was required, the Clarke fam- ily intended to maintain its 33 per cent stake. Hillsdown said it supported the acquisition, but would not be drawn on whether it would maintain its 16.75 per cent shareholding. Clarke shares were suspended at 54p pending com- pletion of the deal, which is not expected until November."

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "I By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent WILSON BOWDEN is one of the few housebuilders which will report an increase in prof- itsduring the first half of this year. Yesterday the group announced pre-tax profits ,ahead from Â£15.2m to Â£15.4m for the half year to the end of June. Earnings per share dipped slightly from 14.5p to 13.6p after allowing for dilution resulting from the Â£34m rights issue made earlier this year. The interim dividend is increased from 2.4 to 2.5p. This is the best result so far from a UK housebuilder in what is proving to be a dismal interim results season. George Wimpey, Britain's second big- gest housebuilder, announced on Wednesday that it had made pre-tax profits of only Â£200,000 during the same period. Wilson Bowden, which is strongly based in the Midlands but also builds in southern and eastern England, increased housing profts by 13 per cent from Â£10.6m to Â£12m. Profits from sales of commer- cial property slipped by a fifth from Â£4.8m to Â£3.8m. Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, said the roup bad sold 650 homes dur. ing the first half - 14 per cent more than during the first six months of 1990. The housing market, how- ever, had become more diffi cult since the spring. Whether the group would match the 1,263 homes sold last year would depend upon how sales fared during the next eight weeks. \"There is a hint that things might be picking up again. We have just had our best week- end for three months - but, that could just as easily disap- pear next weekend, said Mr Wilson. He said that the group had increased its purchases of land to prepare for the recovery when it came. At the end of June the group had net cash of Â£10.4m compared with shareholders funds of Â£156m. 0 COMMMNT Wilson Bowden has displayed its worth in the first half. Sales and margins are up in what has been described as the worst housing market for half a century. The secret of its suc- cess is its long land bank, cur- rently standing at about 6,500 plots. Of this about a fifth was bought six or seven years ago at what remains very cheap prices. The group intends to use its financial strength to increase the number of plots it holds to more than 7,000. This would take net debt up to about Â£10m which would still leave gearing under 10 per cent. Profits, depending upon the next few weeks, could be between Â£28m and the Â£30m it earned last year. It remains a quality buy in a hard hit sec- tor.",

A wide-ranging shake-up of operations - including the clo- sure of loss-making outlets, stricter financial controls and a 50 per cent cut in stock val- ues - was largely responsible for the improved performance. \"Our base is a lot stronger now than it was at the same time last year,\" said Mr Ian Ritchie, chief executive. \"With an upturn in the economy, we should certainly benefit.\" Turnover in the 53 weeks to June 1 increased only slightly to Â£14.8m (Â£14.2m). However, sales per outlet per week increased by 9.5 per cent. Mr Ritchie said this was the result of an improved training pro- gramme, better service and new buying policies. An exceptional charge of Â£77,000 (Â£1.68m) was due to store opening and closing costs. During the year, 14 out- lets - most of them conces- sions in department stores - were closed and a further five opened in high street locations. More closures are planned. The group, which has 66 out- lets in the UK, plans to focus increasingly on the high street. Mr Andrew Noble, chairman, said the recession had resulted in good opportunities to acquire prime sites. Earnings per share emerged at 2.04p against losses of 17.18p. Fully-diluted earnings, taking into account executive and employee share options, were 1.96p. No dividend is declared.",

   "text_content" : "By Willam Dawklsm in Paris THOMSON-CSF,. the French state-controlled defence electronics group, is to shift production of its newest ground- to-air missiles from the US to Europe. Euromissile, the consortium grouping French state-owned Adrospatiale and MBB, the German aerospace group, is to take over production of the Thomson mis- sile from next year. This could herald closer co-operation in other areas between Euromissile and Thomson-CSF, which have traditionally been competitors, said executives. It comes in response to a shift in demand by hard- pressed defence ministries away from new missile systems and towards refits of exist- ing ones, said officials. \"We are not merging all our missile activities. We are Just making an economic accord for this programme,\" said Mr Nola Clavelloux, director of Thomson's missiles systems branch. However, Thomson would be prepared to increase cooperation with uromissile step by step on a \"pragmatic\" bads. The missile is the VT1, a short range weapon capable ot travelling at 3.5 time the speed of sound, much faster than exist ing missiles of its type. It has been made by the defence division of LTV, the ailing US steel company, which has produced 1,000 examples for Thomson. The French defence group asked LTV to develop the VTl five years ago, for sale on the US market, and to sell as a new generation of its own Crotale missiles, also marketed as the Shahine in the Middle East. Euromissile wil split production of the Sequally between France and Ger- any, or use in its Roland ground-to-air misaie systems and for Crotale, fonnerly oland's main competitor. The VTI can be fred from existing Crotale and Rolanu launchers, a cheap way of updating both systems. The partners refused to divulge the rice of the VT1, though Mr Jean-Louis Fache, director of Adrospatiale's tactical missiles division, estimated the potential market, the replacement of the 25,000 Rolands and 6,000 Crotales now in service, could be worth FFr0Sbn ($5.08bn). Of that, the VTI could hope to account for 20,000 replacements, depending on how fast defence ministries choose to update their ground-to-air systems."

   "text_content" : "William Dawkins on moves that could lead to wider co-operation UNTIL recently, the French defence indus- try used to pride itself on at least giving the impres- sion that competition between its different producers was being encouraged. Just how much the decline in world demand for defence equipment has cooled that old bravado was underlined yester- day when Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled defence elec- tronics group headed by Mr Alain Gomez, announced that it was to turn over US-based production of its latest missile, the VT1, to Euromissile, the 20- year-old consortium of Adro- spatiale, also state-owned, and MBB, the German missile group. \"AMrospatiale will avoid the high cost of developing a new missile and Thomson-CSF will have a broader market in which to amortise the develop- ment cost of the VT1,\" said Thomson. \"This co-operation will reduce competition between the members,\" and hence cut costs, added Mr Jean-Louis Fache, director of Adrospatiale's tactical missiles division. Not long ago, the Euromis- sile partners and Thomson-CSF had very different plans. Adro- spatiale and MBB embarked just over a year ago on a FFrlbn programme to produce a new Roland, code-named RM-5, with Matra, the French space, telecommunications and transport group. At the same time, Thomson was planning to pool its entire missiles busi- ness with British Aerospace to Alain Gomez: co-operation would be market-led create Eurodynamics, which would have been Europe's lead- ing producer. Six months ago, Thomson pulled out of its British Aero- space deal on the grounds that the market had become too uncertain to embark on a joint venture of this type. In July, the Euromissile partners drew in their horns by shelving indefinitely the RM-5. Eurodynamics was a seduc- tive idea at the time, said Mr Clavelloux, but the market has now changed so that there is far more demand for retrofits of existing missile systems, of the kind offered by VT1 for Crotale and Roland, than for completely new weapons. The decision is clearly bad news for Matra, producer of missile bodies for the early generations of Crotales, which carry Thomson-made electron- ics. Matra earns 25 per cent of turnover from defence, mainly from three big missile pro grammes. The company began to lose its involvement in the new Crotale five years ago, when Thomson turned to the missiles and electronics divi- sion of LTV, the ailing US steelmaker, to make the VTI for the new generation Crotale , the first orders for which are now being shipped. Matra has also been cut out of Roland's future. Admittedly, it had spent less than FFr2Om on the RM-5 project, and does work on other products with Thomson and Euromissile. Yet this is at a time of increased competition in an important area of its business, the Espace family van, which accounted for 14.6 per cent of group sales last year. Stock- broking analysts believe Matra will now be under pressure to limit itself to a smaller market, making air-to-air missiles, although the company strongly denies this. It is equally bad news for LTV, which has just shipped its first and last 1,000 VTI mis- siles for Thomson, and will now see production shifted to Euromissiles' four French and German sites from next year. While LTV will no doubt shed a tear, it will be unsur- prised, since a possible shift of production to Europe was fore- shadowed in the original con- tract, says Thomson.",

We therefore request our stockholders to oresent the ordinary share certificates bearing the company name 'Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft\". with the renewal coupon, during normal business hours at a branch of one of the credit institutions listed below during the period September 16 to December 17,1991 inclusive so that they may be exchanged for new ordinary shares bearing the company name \"Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft\".

Once the ordinary share certificates handed in, together with the renewal coupon, have been examined to establish that they are in order, new ordinary shares bearing the company name \"Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft\" and the date of issue \"April 1991\" will be issued, accompanied by a dividend coupon sheet containing dividend coupons nos. 31-50 and a renewal coupon. Certificates for one share (DM 50). global share certificates for 10 shares (DM 500) and 50 shares (DM 2.500), and multiple share certificates for 2,000 shares (DM 100.000) are available. If shares are held in custody by a credit institution, the exchange will be effected without special instructions from the depositor; in this case the stockholder need take no action. The new share certificates will be made available to stockholders free of commission and charges.The depositary banks are requested to contact one of the above-named exchange agents with regard to refunding of the client commission for share certificates held in separate safe custody or jacket custody/actually exchanged certificates. There is no client commission in the case of shares held in giro-transferable collective custody, as these shares will be exchanged without the particpation of the depositary banks and the depositors do not need to be notified. The newly issued ordinary share certificates will be deliverable on all German stock exchanges from September 16. 1991 onwards alongside the old share certificates. The now incorrect ordinary share certificates bearing the company name 'Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft will cease to be deliverable as of October 16. 1991. Old incorrect ordinary shar6 certificates of our company which have not been presented by December 17. 1991 will be cancelled in accordance with Section 73 of the German Corporation Act. The necessaryauthorization has been granted by the Wolfburg District Court. _ _ The Board of Management Wolfsburg. September 1991 Interim Report 1991 for Skandia Group Insurance Company Ltd. The management operating result, which includes unrealized changes in the value of assets, rose to MSEK 764 (344)- Net asset value on 3oth June, 1991 totalled MSEK I6,733 (16,105). This corresponds to SEK 218 per share, which is an increase of SEK 8 over 3Ist December, 1990. The operating result for the period was MSEK 7 (1,510). INSURANCE OPERATIONS The trend of results for the insurance operations was unsatisfactory. Premium levels in several markets are still not sufficient to cover costs for claims and administration.

   "text_content" : "By Rnald vn do Krol in Amsterdam AHOLD, the Dutch super- market group which operates four large grocery chains in the eastern US, yesterday reported a 10.2 per cent increase in second-quarter profit as strong growth in the US outstripped a more modest gain at home. Net profit in the second quarter rose to Fl 64.4m (388m) from F1 58.5m in the same period of 1990, raising first-half results to Fl140.8m from F 1l26.3m, a gain of 11.5 per cent., The figures were at the upper end of analysts' expecta- tions, and Ahold's shares rose Fl 2.60 to close at F182.50. Ahold said that operating profit in the US surged by 64 per cent to $41.2m, thanks mainly to the first-time consol- idation of the Tops Markets chain in New York state. In the Netherlands, operat- ing profit showed a slight rise to F1 39.4m. The company said that domestic profit growth had been held back by wage rises as well as the disappoint- ing performance of its institu- tional food supply division which is currently undergoing restructuring. Although operating profit was up 40 per cent overall, a strong rise in interest charges connected to the Tops acquisi- tion limited growth in net profit to 10 per cent. Ahold's dual-currency interim divi- dend has been set at F10.30 and $0.10, a slight rise from the F10.30 and $0.075 at the end of the 1990 first half. Second-quarter sales in the Netherlands increased 7.6 per cent to F12.4bn, while US sales jumped 37 per cent to $1.4bn due to the Tops takeover. Excluding Tops, the rise was just under 7 per cent. Ahold's three other US chains - BI-LO, Giant and First National - all posted sales increases, but growth was hampered by the US reces- sion, the company said. It repeated earlier forecasts that after-tax results will show a rise in the full year 1991 com- pared with 1990, in spite of the increase in interest charges prompted by its most recent US acquisition.",

   "text_content" : "By RonaM van do Krol INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the newly-formed Dutch financial services group, posted an 18.8 per cent increase in first-half net profit and forecast a \"satis- factory\" rise in full-year results. The company, formed in March through the merger between Nationale-Neder- landen, the biggest Dutch insurer, and NMB Postbank, the country's third largest bank, said net profit rose to F1746m ($382.5m) in the first six months of 1991. In the same period of last year, the partners posted a combined net profit of Fl 628m. A reason for the strong profit rise was a turnround in non- life insurance, which managed to produce a slim profit of \"l7m after a loss of Fll35m in early 1990 due to heavy winter storms in north-western Europe. This improvement helped the former Nat-Ned achieve a 27 per cent rise in net profit, compared with a 6.8 per cent increase for its merger partner NMB Postbank. Describing its first-half per- formance as good, ING announced an interim dividend of Fl 1.50, a rise of nearly 5 per cent compared with F11.43 a year earlier. The figures, the first presented by the new company, were released anter the close of bourse trad. ing yesterday. In life insurance, ING posted a pre-tax profit of Fl 220m comr pared with F1226m in the 1990 first half. The group attributed the flat life results to high start-up costs in new markets such as Taiwan and South Korea. In banking, the group saw a 33 per cent rise in international lending, helping to compensate for a modest 3 per cent growth in lending at home. At the end of June, internai tional lending accounted for 17 per cent of the total credit port- folio, compared with 14 per cent a year earlier. Overall, lending rose 6.8 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Taylor in Stockholm SVENSKA Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), the lead- ing Swedish pulp and paper company, has lowered its prof- its forecast for the current year. Earnings (after net sinan- cial items) are set to fall by as much as 10 per cent from last year's figure of SKr2.135bn (338m), the company said. The drop in profits would have been much greater if a rationalisation programme had not been pushed through which SCA estimated would contribute a net gain of SKr500m. This included the loss of 3,500 jobs. Without the cut in costs the deterioration in profits (after net financial items) would have been around 35 per cent from the SKr2.135bn achieved in 1990 rather than the 20 per cent fall predicted when the first four months' results were published. It added that earn- ings per share would be higher than last year at SKr7.70 com- pared with SKr7.26 in 1990. The company said that there were \"no indications that the market situation\" in Sweden would improve this autumn."

Mr George Jacobs, the group's president, said that weakness in the US market, particularly in the chemicals sector, had affected the results. Fierce competition in the sec- tor meant that full-year profits would be lower than in 1990. The 1992 financial year would be much better. He expected the company's anti-allergic drug Zyrtec to be licensed in the US next year. The group announced it had acquired the shares it did not already own in Radcure Speci- alities, the resins manufac- turer, by buying Rh6acne Poul- enc's 49.9 per cent stake.

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins FRAMATOME, the leading French builder of nuclear reac- tors, is negotiating to take majority control of its two US joint ventures in power station maintenance and nuclear fuel supplies. Babcock & Wilcox, the engi- neering subsidiary of McDermott International, the US energy services group, said it was talking to the French group with the aim of selling half its shares in B&W Nuclear Service Company and B&W Fuel Company. Framatome took a 50 per cent stake in the services com- pany two years ago. It earlier took a 49 per cent share in the fuel supplier, in a consortium with the French nuclear fuel producers, Uranium Pechiney and Cogema. The aim is to lift both stakes to 75 per cent by the end of the year, leaving Framatome the opportunity to buy more later. While Framatome has never sold a nuclear plant in the US, it has been keen to make use of its reputation as a large plant supplier to gain entry into the growing market for mainte- nance and servicing. The purpose of buying into the Babcock & Wilcox compa- nies was to gain a local pres- -ence, Framatome executives explained at the time.",

   "text_content" : "By Martin DIckson in New York EMBARRASSMENT and apol- ogises are not features nor- mally associated with Procter & Gamble, the giant US con. sumer products group with a reputation for caution and secrecy. But both have been evident this week following an investigation into leaks of information at the company. The probe has turned into a public relations disaster for P&G and set off a row about press freedom. Mr Edwin Artzt, P&G's chairman, admitted in a letter to employees this week that his attempts to discover who had been disseminating infor- mation to outsiders had \"cre- ated a problem larger than the one we were trying to solve\". The saga began last June when P&G asked police in Cin- cinnati, Ohio, where the com- pany has its headquarters, to investigate leaks to Ms Alecia Swasy, a Pittsburgh-based cor- respondent of The Wall Street Journal The authorities obtained subpoenas that forced the local telephone company, Cincinnati Bell, to release records of all telephone calls to the office, fax or home phones of Ms Swasy. P&G invoked a state statute which makes it illegal for an employer to \"disclose business secrets to anyone outside his or her company\". The move provoked outcry among newspapers and jour- nalists' organisations, which accused P&G of abusing the US constitution's guarantees of press freedom and setting a sinister example which other companies might follow. The attacks intensified when it emerged that the police offi- cer who headed the investiga- tion also drew a second salary as a part-time member of P&G's own security staff. In a letter to staff this week, Mr Artzt admitted that the company had made \"an error of judgment. We thought we were doing the right thing, because we had a clear legal right to seek the assistance of the authorities to investigate potential damaging leaks of confidential company informa- tion,\" he maintained. However, the result had been public controversy and \"reac- tions in the press that reflected negatively on the company\". He regretted \"the embarrass- ment that our employees have had to share in recent weeks\". Mr Artzt also gave details of the leaks - which appear not to have been traced. He said they included \"very confiden- tial business information, such as our capital spending figures\".",

   "text_content" : "By Karen Zgeor in New York SEARLE, the Chicago-based drug company which is wholly- owned by Monsanto, yesterday said it was taking a 12.25 per cent stake in Tokyo-based Hokuriku Seiyaku in a deal valued at $106m. Dr Ronald Goode, corporate senior vice-president at Searle, said the move was \"a signifi- cant step forward in our strate- gic plan for becoming a major player in the Japanese pharma- ceutical market\". Hokuriku, with annual sales of about $118m, is a maker of ethical pharmaceutical prod- ucts, including Bareon, used to treat urinary and respiratory tract infectilns; T'hiaton, an antispasmodic for gastritis; and Hokunalin, for the treat- ment of acute asthma. It Is reputed to place an unusually strong emphasis on research and development for a com- pany of its size. Searle, with annual sales of about $1.4bn, has a product line which includes the diuret- ics Aldactone and Aldactra- aide, as well as Cytotec, used to treat ulcers. Japan is the second biggest pnarmaceutical market after the US. On a per-capita basis, the Japanese are the world's biggest consumers of drugs, according to Mr Viren Mehta, an analyst at Mehta & Isealy in New York. However, Japan has been a very difcult market for foreign companies to gain a foothold. Neither Searle nor Hokuriku are dominant in the increas- ingly global pharmaceuticals industry, which is led by com- panies such as Merck with annual sales of about $8bn. The combination is expected to benefit both companies. Although Searle is paying a premium of about 25 per cent for its stake in Hokuriku, many Japanese pharmaceutical companies are undervalued.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harvm on in New York STANDARD & Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday fol- lowed in the footsteps of Moody's Investors Service by downgrading Salomon Brothers because of the damag- ing effect that the auction-rig- ging scandal was having on the WaU Street firm's financial position. The agency has lowered its rating of the senior and subor- dinated debt and preferred stock of Salomon Inc, the par- ent company. Unlike Moody's, however, S&P did not change its rating of the firm's commercial paper, because it believes Salomon has enough liquidity to meet maturing obligations until nor- mal short-term funding operations are resumed once confidence in the firm is restored. S&P also expressed confi- dence in the fundamental soundness of Salomon's operations, and said it did not expect the costs from litigation and government fines to dam- age seriously the firm's sinan- cial health. So far, the effects of the downgradings have been mini- mal, although Salomon has admitted the cost of short-term financings has risen slightly. This was primarily because a number of big US institutions bad stopped investing in the frm's commercial paper after it was rated below top invest- ment grade by Moody's. The number of lawsuits against Salomon continued to pile up yesterday. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Salo- mon said that 13 additional shareholder suits had been launched, including one that was seeking damages of at least 500m. Although precise figures are not available, it is believed that well over 20 legal actions have been filed against Salo- mon since the scandal broke in August.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Skapinker INMOS, the UK-based semi- conductor manufacturer, has secured exclusive rights to manufacture and market IBM's new chips for generating per- sonal computer graphics. Inmos, owned by SGS- Thomson, the Italian-French semiconductor group, will not sell the chips to IBM, which will make its own advanced graphics products. Instead, Inmos will sell sets of chips, known as the extended graphics array (XGA), to other manufacturers as part of IBM's drive to estab- lish the product as the world- wide standard for personal computers. IBM's agreement with Inmos is one of several collaborative ventures the US computer maker has set up recently. It has also struck deals with Apple Computer, of the US, and with Siemens, the German electronics group. Inmos is a supplier to IBM of video graphics array (VGA) chip sets, an earlier technol- ogy. The XGA chips are faster, contain more colours, and can be more easily used with soft- ware which allows users to select options from a series of on-screen windows. IBM did not exclude the pos- sibility that it might buy XGA chips from Inmos, but made clear the UK-based company's role was to ensure other manu- facturers used the technology. \"Simply stated, we want to have XGA as the graphics standard for the PC industry,\" Mr Al Testani, an IBM divi- sional director, said yesterday. Inmos will start selling IBM- manufactured XGA chip sets immediately and will begin manufacturing chips carrying its own name within the next few months. The chip sets marketed by Inmos will contain two chips, one of which will be made at the Inmos plant in Newport, south Wales, and the other at SGS-Thomson's factory in Car- rollton, Texas. The sets will be tested at SGS-Thomson's facil- ity in Malta. Inmos will retain exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights to the XGA chips for 18 months. For a further 18 months, SGS-Thomson would have the right to make an XGA product equivalent to any that IBM may develop with another company.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Westfleld in Sydney WESTERN Mining, the Aust- ralian group which is embroiled in a bitter takeover battle for Australian Consoli- dated Minerals, yesterday announced a 14 per cent fall in net equity profit, to A$361.9m (US$285m) for the year to end- June. The earnings decline was due mainly to the 16.6 per cent slide, to A$278.4m, in the con- tribution from Alcoa Australia, the aluminium producer. West- ern owns 48 per cent of Alcoa. Western Mining's consoli- dated profit, excluding equity associates, dropped 21.5 per cent to A$275.8m, from sales 11.6 per cent up at A$1.54bn. Group earnings before tax fell 20.7 per cent to A$294.6m from the previous year's A$371.6m. Pre-tax profit from Western Mining's Kambalda nickel mine fell 20 per cent to A$105m, but gold earnings were up to A$106.3m from A$64.6m last year. Most Australian gold produc- ers had boosted output dramat- ically in the months before January when gold earnings became taxable. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director, said that Western faced a tough year because of lower prices and decreased pro- duction. The outlook for the rest of the year \"is not as good as the previous year on current conditions\", he said. Directors said the group's balance sheet continued to be strong, with shareholders' funds of nearly A$3Sbn. Cash reserves and borrowings, which are mainly non-recourse and related to the group's huge Olympic Dam uranium and gold mine, largely offset each other, leaving the company effectively debt-free. The board set a final divi- dend of 11 cents, taking the full-year pay-out to 24 cents, fully-franked, compared with 30 cents last year. Western Mining, in conjunc- tion with the Normandy Posei- don group, is bidding for ACM at A$1.11 a share, valuing the target at AS266m."

   "text_content" : "Karen Zagor follows the Parretti court case A WEB of broken prom- ises and undocumented loans which does little credit to either Mr Giancarlo Parretti's business methods or Credit Lyonnais Bank Neder- land's (CLBN) lending prac- tices has emerged in the legal battle for control of MGM. The Delaware court case cen- tres on whether Mr Parretti, the controversial Italian entre- preneur, breached a corporate governance agreement signed in April. The bank alleges that financial mismanagement by Mr Parretti had brought the studio to the brink of bank- ruptcy and that it agreed to lend MGM $145m to stay in business on condition that Mr Parretti ceded day-to-day con- trol. Mr Parretti claims that the bank broke its promises, sabo- taged his attempts to run the studio, and that the corporate governance agreement is invalid. The bank is seeking a perma- nent injunction to bar Mr Par- retti and two associates from serving as directors, while Mr Parretti is fighting to regain control of MGM. In an interview, Mr Francois Gille, deputy director-general of Credit Lyonnais and a mem- ber of CLBN's supervisory committee, described the con- fused and complex negotia- tions which led CLBN to acquire an exposure of almost $900m to Mr Parretti. Credit Lyonnais's relation- ship with Mr Parretti was forged through its Dutch sub- sidiary which had a long and generally lucrative history of investments in Hollywood pre- dating its acquisition by Credit Lyonnais in 1983. Mr Parretti's involvement with CLBN dates from 1987 when he acquired Cannon 3roup, the foundering B-movie studio that was a long-standing CLBN customer. Cannon was renamed Pathd Communica- tions. But when Mr Parretti, who is appealing a jail sentence for Fraudulent bankruptcy in Naples, started putting together his $1.3bn bid for MGM in March 1990, concern about his past and the source of his funds had made him such a political liability in France that the French govern- ment blocked his bid for con- trol of Pathd Cinema. Credit Lyonnals says it told CLBN to reduce its exposure to Mr Parretti's empire before he embarked on the MGM deal. But, last July, Credit Lyon- nais admitted its CLBN subsid- iary had lent Parretti's various companies $880m, excluding about $400m in factoring. The bank, which had been silent about its exposure to Parretti through most of this year, said the litigation had allowed it to break banking protocol about outstanding loans to customers and release details. Even more embarrassing for Credit Lyonnais was CLBN's admission in the court case that it not only advanced $160m to Mr Parretti to help complete the purchase, but also failed to document every aspect of the transaction. Last year, CLBN denied it had been involved in the acquisition. As one of the terms of Mr Parretti's deal with Mr Kirk: Kerkorian, who held 80 per cent of MGM, Mr Parretti agreed to forfeit $353m if the takeover failed. Credit Lyonnais says that, only days before the deal was supposed to close, Mr Parretti went to CLBN and said he needed a bridging loan of $160m or the takeover would collapse. The bank's risk was about $200m in loans to other Par- retti entities if the deal had failed. The amount was secured by assets. Mr Gille, the Credit Lyonnais director who was brought in ea-rlier this year to help sort out MGM, is adamant the funds were pro- vided as part of a short-term loan which was to be replaced almost immediately with three permanent investments which Mr Parretti had promised. \"I recognise a lack of docu- mentation of the bridge financ- ing, for which there may have been good reasons,\" said Mr Gille. \"Looking back, I wish it had been handled differently. \"With hindsight, there may have been an error of judg- ment to believe in the promises of Mr Parretti for investors.\" However, Mr Parretti's col- leagues claim the lack of loan documentation was part of an elaborate cover-up to hide the bank's exposure to Mr Parretti. In court, Mr Parretti's law- yer said \"we do, and will, con- test that these were bridge fin- ancings and there was any commitment by Mr Parretti\" to substitute the $160m with out- side investments in MGM. The bank alleges Mr Parretti promised investments of $60m from the UK company, Rank Film Laboratories, which he said was covered by insurance bonds, and a contribution of $50m from Fininvest, the pri- vately-held media company controlled by Mr Silvio Berlus- coni, and another $50m from Mr Kerkorian. In a letter to the bank, Mr Parretti said he would reim- burse the $50m from Mr Kerko- rian one day after the closing. The bank says Mr Parretti later repaid this. Mr Parretti's deposition shows the $50m commitment from Fininvest - described in an October 1990 letter from the managing director of Fininvest to CLBN as \"irrevocable\" - was anything but irrevocable. According to Mr Parretti's deposition, Mr Berlusconi said that,if he could get a bank loan he would consider an invest- ment, but if he had to pay cash it would be impossible. Mr Par- Gliancarlo Parretti: battle over corporate agreement retti added Mr Berlusconi wanted a guarantee he would not be called upon to invest in MIGM'If he changed his mind. CLBN says it never saw a penny from Fininvest or Rank to cover the $110m outstand- ing. Both sides agree there were several contingencies linked to a possible Rank investment. Rank had merely expressed a vague interest in an investment in MGM. The bank says that insurance bonds meant to cover the Rank contribution were to be false. The bank said the negotia- ting continued with Rank and Fininvest, which is also a Credit Lyonnaise client in Milan, through June. Although the Parretti camp insists the paperwork is lack- ing in several other CLBN transactions, Mr Gille says \"the only weakness in docu- mentation at the end of March relates to the $110m loans made to cover expected invest- ments from Fininvest and Rank\". Mr Parretti's debts to CLBN have been shifted so many times it is hard to trace them. The Credit Lyonnais loans were made to a byzantine col- lection of companies of which IMGM was one. Together with Mr Florio Fiorini, the Geneva-based Ital- ian socialist financier who has been Mr Parretti's main backer, assets were juggled and multiple companies were used to fund the Hollywood deal. MGM owes the bank about $400m. Melia, a Madrid- based owner of travel agencies, in which Mr Parretti is a sub- stantial shareholder, owes CLBN about $350m. Credit Lyonnais says it has now tried to create a more real- istic balance between the autonomy of its subsidiaries and centralised control from Paris. Stung by accusations that it cannot keep track of the lend- ing practices of its own subsid- iaries in Europe, Credit Lyon- nais's Mr Gille says this \"does not mean that we don't exer- cise close control on the activi- ties of our subsidiaries and we have strengthened Paris con- trols where there were reasons to do so\". Credit Lyonnais is now set- ting up a unit in Los Angeles. The case is expected to take several weeks and will be fol- lowed by a lender liability suit in Los Angeles, where Pathe is seeking more than $lbn in damages from Credit Lyonnais."

   "text_content" : "By John Ridding In Seoul HYUNDAI Petrochemical, a subsidiary of the Hyundai Group, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, is mov- ing into the production of syn- thetic rubber through a tech- nology transfer agreement with Goodyear, the US tyre company. The new business will be the first to use materials from Hyundai's $2bn petrochemical complex, completed earlier this year. Part of the planned produc- tion of synthetic rubber will be supplied to Hyundai Motors, another Hyundai subsidiary and Korea's largest carmaker. Under terms of the agreement, which awaits approval from the Korean government, Good- year will supply technology for the production of the synthetic rubber. Hyundai declined to disclose the amount it was paying for the technology transfer. Hyundai plans to produce 80,000 tons of synthetic rubber a year after it starts production in 1994. This total will include 30,000 tons of styrenebutadiene rubber and butadiene rubber and 20,000 tons of other rubber. Hyundai will get its supply of butadiene, a key ingredient in synthetic rubber, from its naphtha-cracker plant on the west coast of Korea. The company's decision to manufacture synthetic rubber has prompted fears of over-ca- pacity in the Korean market. Yukong, Korea's largest oil refiner, and Daelim, a Korean petrochemical company, plan to move into production of syn- thetic rubber. Analysts foresee little increase in demand. A spokesman for Hyundai Petrochemical, however, said he saw little difficulty in find- ing a market for its rubber.",

Attributable earnings fell to R418m ($146.1m) from R429.6m a year earlier. Equity accounted earnings, before extraordinary items, dropped to R565.2m from R601.6m because of lower retained earn- ings from associates. The main contributor to equity-accounted earnings was platinum, which kicked in with R196.2m, an increase of 9 per cent over the previous year. JCI controls Rustenburg Plati- num, the world's largest pro ducer. Mining overall contributed 60.1 per cent of earnings, with diamonds and coal contribut- ing 13.9 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Gold contrib- uted only R11.3m, or 2 per cent, reflecting the weak gold price and the more conservative div- idend policy of JCI's mines. Only slightly behind plati- num was income from indus- trial investments, which con- tributed R193.2m.",

   "text_content" : "I By Mark Westfield in Sydney BRAMBLES Industries, the Australian transport and waste management group, yesterday announced its first profit decline for 18 years. The com- pany posted net earnings down 13.4 per cent to A$192.12m (US$150.8m) for the year to June 30. Group operating profit for the year before tax and abnor- mals slid 6.7 per cent to A$311.83m on the previous year's earnings of A$334.29m. Sales revenues were 11.2 per cent up at A$2.29bn, due partly to the inclusion of revenues from recently-acquired bulk haulage and heavy haulage operations in France and the UK. Elsewhere, revenues were flat, with recession in its main market in Australia as well as in the UK and the US holding back performance. The stock jumped 15 cents over the day, peaking at 20 cents above Wednesday's close, after directors decided to pay a special 5 cents fully-franked dividend with its unchanged final dividend of 25 cents, tax- free, to take the payout for the year to 55 cents fully franked. Brambles said the special dividend was a partial distribu- tion of its surplus franking credits. * BTR Nylex, the 62 per cent subsidiary of BTR in the UK, joined the growing ranks of Australian groups reporting sharp falls in earnings. Equity net profit for the six months to June 30 fell 41.6 per cent to A$151.14m from A$258.93m (US$203.24) for the corresponding period last year. Profit falls in most of its markets in Australia and the US were only partly offset by improved earnings in operations in Malaysia, Thai- land, Indonesia and Japan. Sales in its main market, Australia and New Zealand, were down 12.6 per cent to A$1.24bn, and earnings for the region dropped 44 per cent to A$177.1m as a result of tight margins in its automotive, building products and commer- cial interiors businesses. BTR shares closed 3 cents up yesterday at A$2.76. In May they reached a high of A$3.46."

   "text_content" : "By Sar Wbb in London and Karen Zagor in New York JAPANESE government bonds reached new highs in the cash and futures market on hopes of an easing' in interest rates. However, the cash market fell back on position-closing and profit-taking to end slightly lower on the day. Overnight unsecured call money rates slipped to 7A per GOVERNMENT BONDS cent from 715 per cent, but the market hopes to see a further easing in interest rates soon. Traders are waiting for the release today of the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic \"Tankan\" report. It is widely expected to show a slowdown in the Japanese economy, with a fall in capital investment and personal consumption. The market will also be watching today's US employ- ment report to see whether the US Federal Reserve eases inter- est rates. A fall in US interest rates would put pressure on the Bank of Japan to lower its official discount rate. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB reached 6.245 per cent, as the bond price hit its highest level since February. The yield closed at opening price of 6.275 per cent, slightly up on its opening of 6.265 per cent. *UK government bond prices rose yesterday, helped by the government's improved stand- ing in the opinion polls and sterling's continued strength despite Wednesday's base rate cut. Short and medium-dated gilts showed strong gains while long-dated gilts only edged up. The 10 per cent gilt due 1996 opened at 100% and traded up to 100H, while the benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 edged up from 112% to 112f. Traders expect the Bank of England to announce either a gilt auction or tap issue shortly as part of its funding pro- gramme. *The French government bond auction yesterday was well-received, allowing the Treasury to sell a total of FFr6.73bn of bonds. However, government bond prices fell between % to % of a percent- age point during the day, fol- lowing the US Treasury bond market. The French Treasury sold FFr4.43bn of the 9.5 per cent OAT due 2001, at an average yield of 8.94 per cent, and FFr2.3bn of the 8.5 per cent bond due 2019 at an average yield of 9.03 per cent. The bid- to-cover ratios for both of the auctioned bonds were high, traders said. On the Matif futures exchange, the September bond futures contract closed at 106.14, down 0.14 from late Wednesday on volume of 75,977. Elsewhere, German govern- ment bonds slipped back, fol- lowing the US Treasury bond market. Traders reported fur- ther switching out of German and French government bonds into Ecu bonds yesterday.

The market's weak under- tone was set by a statement from the Federal Reserve Board governor, Mr John Laware, who said the US econ- omy \"is in the early stages of a genuine recovery\". The impact of Mr Laware's comments was short-lived, however, as the market returned to the employment data. Pessimism seemed to take hold in the afternoon, with the 30-year long bond slid- ing H to 100%, yielding 8.09 per cent, after trading about A lower through most of the morning. At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year note was A lower for a yield of 6.31 per cent.

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Watera THE FORMER head of equities at Drexel Burnham Lambert has been appointed to run the equities business of County NatWest, the investment bank- ing arm of the UK clearer. The move marks the latest in a series of senior manage- ment changes at County, which has been through a tur- bulent four years since the 1987 stock market crash. It has been threatened with clo- sure if it cannot return to sus. tained profitability in the near future, though its performance this year has been on target. Mr Arthur Kirsch, who takes over as managing direc- tor of County NatWest Securi- ties from Mr Tim Ferguson, took 60 Drexel staff to County after the US securities firm closed in early 1990. He will remain president of County's US equity operations. The departure of Mr Ferg- uson after two years completes another round of senior man- agement changes at County, leaving it with its third revamped top management team since the equity business was created during the UK's Big Bang reforms five years ago. Mr Ferguson was said by County to have left \"for per- sonal reasons\" and could not be contacted yesterday. He had done much to bring County's cost base under control in the past two years and rebuild its flagging reputation in UK equity research. However, the firm's revenues remain too low, and Mr Kirsch hinted yes- terday that more should have been done to get different parts of the bank to work together. Mr Kirsch, a former top- rated US beverage and tobacco analyst, said both US and UK equity businesses were per- forming well, and that his aim was to develop greater strengths in corporate finance on both sides of the Atlantic, where County has been weak in the past.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter John SIMEX, the Singapore futures exchange which last year saw a fall in turnover for the first time since it began trading in 1984, has been seeking links with leading London financial markets in an attempt to boost European interest. A five-strong delegation headed by Mr Francis Yeo Teng Yang, chairman of the Singapore International Mone- tary Exchange, has been in discussions with the Interna- tional Petroleum Exchange (IPE) and the London Sinan- cial Futures Exchange (Liffe) In the hope of developing a collaboration agreement Simex already has a rela- tionship with the Chicago Mer- cantile Exchange, its partner in pioneering the world's first mutual offset trading system. As the first step to 24-hour trading, mutual offset allows a trade opened on one exchange to be closed on the other and be treated as a single transac- tion. Mr Yeo would like a similar relationship with Liffe. He said nothing concrete had developed during the visit, but added: \"Discussions are under way with the IPE on energy contracts. Life is not so firm but we have exchanged views to see where our common interests are.\" Mr Peter Wildblood, the chief executive of the IPE, said yesterday: \"We are exploring various avenues with Simex and we are hopeful that we will be able to develop various possibilities.\" Liffe had no comment at this stage. The Simex delegation has also been making presenta- tions in London, Frankfurt and Paris this week to repre- sentatives of more than 75 financial iastitatitos.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London THERE WAS a more cautious tone in the international bond market yesterday as the mar- ket digested the weight of new paper launched over the past two days and investors waited for release of important employment data in the US today. Compagnie Bancaire, the French state financial institu- tion, came with a $250m four- year deal lead managed by Paribas Capital Markets. The deal carries a 7% per cent coupon and was priced to yield 61 basis points over US Treasury securities. Participants in the deal reported slow demand, and the yield spread had widened to 63.5 basis points by the close of trading. Syndicate managers noted that the issuer had bor- rowed heavily in the interna- tional bond market this year, added to which the coupon was not high enough to attract much retail buying. The Canadian dollar sector also saw more supply, with Ford Motor Credit and Banque Indosuez launching three-year deals via Goldman Sachs. The C$150m Ford deal offered a higher 10% per cent coupon and a yield spread of 95 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The Banque Indosuez paper was priced to offer a yield spread of 49 basis points over government paper. Participants said that the pricing of both deals was com- petitive but fair. Syndicate managers said that both deals should attract retail buying over time, although yesterday sales were much less brisk INTERNATIONAL BONDS than for similar paper earlier in the week. The European Investment Bank added Â£150m to its out- standing Â£386m 10 per cent issue maturing 1997. The fungible tranche was fully underwritten by Barclay's de Zoete Wedd and priced to yield 23 basis points over UK government bonds - the tight- est yield spread on a new Eurosterling issue since April 1989. However, the outstanding paper in the issue ras trading at a yield spread of just 10 basis points. There have been few equity warrant bond issues by Japa- nese companies in the past month but yesterday Arabian Oil, Japan's largest oil pro- ducer, offered a $200m deal lead managed by Nikko Securi- ties. The company produces almost wholly in the Gulf and has, therefore, had mixed for- tunes this year. Yesterday, shares were trad- ing at Y5780, against a year's high of Y8,500 and a low or Y4,880. However, investors appeared to view future pros- pects as encouraging and the deal traded up to 105%/ bid from an issue price of par. * Pemex, the Mexican state- owned oil company, plans to make a seven-year $150m bond Issue, the longest dated Euro- bond issue by Latin American borrower. Swiss Bank Corporation has been awarded the mandate for the deal, which will be priced to yield between 245 and 249 basis points over US Treasury nonds.",

   "text_content" : "BANCO SANTANDER, Spain's second largest banking group, has become one of the first continental European banks to issue perpetual preference shares in the US market with a deal which could substantially cut the cost of raising core cap- ital, writes Simon London. The $150m issue, lead man- aged by Merrill Lynch, was made through a Santander sub- sidiary based in Puerto :Rico However, the deal has been structured such that the pro- ceeds strengthen the balance sheet of the parent bank directly, rather than being accounted for as a minority interest. Moreover, because the issue was made through an offshore subsidiary the shares can be sold to investors in jurisdic- tions outside the US. Merril Lynch said that issuing via the off shore subsidiary also offered tax savings to the bank. The issue of non-cumulative, irredeemable preference shares counts as Tier I or core capital under the Basle agreement on international bank capital ade- quacy. The only other Tier I instrument allowed under the agreement is common equity.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters ATTEMPTS to standardise European securities regulation look once again to be stalled, meaning that the target dead- line for new rules of January 1 199 will now almost certainly be missed. The European Commission had planned a meeting of rep- resentatives of member-states for next Wednesday to try to push forward discussion on the Investment Services Direc- tive, which has been the sub- ject of heated disagreement in recent months. However, the meeting, scheduled to take place in Lux- embourg, has been cancelled and no replacement has been arranged. According to one securities regulator, EC offi- cials have been too busy on other matters to attend to a directive which, on recent showing, none of the member- states are eager to see adopted. An EC official said yester- day that the timetable for the directive was now almost cer- tain to slip. \"It will be very difficult. A one-year imple- mentation period for member- states would be very ambitious - even if the directive was adopted by the end of this year.\" Sir Leon Brittan, the EC minister responsible for com- petition and financial services, had set himself the ambitious task this spring of overcoming resistance to the directive through a series of bilateral meetings with member-states. Yet he has been unable to overcome differences of opin- ion, particularly between the UK and France, over Issues such as transparency of securi- 16-&16 - & 3 - uL mraWa k nuuu wuui eu- ing should be centralised on regulated markets. The EC official did not explain why the latest meeting on the directive has been can- celled, but added: \"Another date will, we hope, be fixed soon.\""

   "text_content" : "APANESE investors' love of trading on margin is just one of the unusual features of the country's stock market thrown into sharp relief during the recent spate of financial scandals. The practice may be well-es- tablished elsewhere, for instance in New York, but even US investors are not nearly so addicted to margin trading as those in Japan. It accounts for 19 per cent of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and constitutes almost half of trading by indi- viduals. Margin buying involves pay- ing a percentage of the transac- tion value in cash or placing securities as collateral and then borrowing the rest from a broker or a securities finance company. Margin selling involves putting up collateral and then selling borrowed shares in the hope that the market will fall. Margin trading in Japan has some unique features - nota- bly that it's financing is domi- nated by a little-understood hybrid company, Japan Securi- ties Finance (JSS), which is the sole independent institution, other than brokers, empowered to give loans and lend securi- ties to brokerages and inves- tors for margin transactions. In the US, by contrast, insti- tutional investors and speci- alised companies are free to lend stock for margin transac- tions to earn commission and fees. JSS is a private profit-mak- ing company but is charged with a public duty of ensuring that margin trading goes smoothly. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is officially empowered to raise margin col- lateral requirements on stocks it considers the targets of spec- ulative trading. However, JSS, in liaison with the TSE, can also limit stock lending for margin trading in volatile stocks with high margin posi- tions, thus in effect restricting speculative activity. JSS was set up in 1955 by the Bank of Japan, and its senior staff come from the central bank or the Ministry of Finance. JSS generated Y172.2bn in operating revenue for the year ended March 1991, mainly through the issue of loans for margin transactions and bond financing. The com- pany employs 380. Currently three stocks on the first section of the TSE are under stock lending limits set by JSS in agreement with the TSE. But due to the recent increase in speculative activ- ity, the number of issues on the TSE watch list of stocks of which price movements are thought speculative, has risen to 11 from five in late 1989, the peak of the bull market. To be placed on the list, a stock price needs to fit criteria such as a price fluctuation exceeding 50 per cent of a stock's daily limit for a few days, some investors argue that a commercial company should not have the power to restrict trading, and that JSF's regula lions go against the free opera tion of the market. M-r Fumio Kimura, senior managing director of JSS, says that one of the major functions of JSS is to ensure that margin transactions are carried out smoothly. He says that although the company is an unique institution, it does not have a monopoly. JSS accounts for 10 per cent of lending for margin buying transactions, and between 30 to 40 per cent for stock lending for margin selling. The broking houses account for the rest of the market. SSS is quite open about its close ties with the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance. Every president has been an ex-Bank of Japan offi- cial, and the company claims to work in close contact with the Ministry of Finance and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Some market participants amue that instead of control- ling the quantity of stock lend. ing, JSS should increase lend- ing rates as demand increases. This way, it could use market forces to curb speculators. They also argue that more securities finance companies should be allowed to operate. But Mr Kimura says that while loans on margin buying transactions can be controlled by fluctuating rates, lending stocks is a different matter, There is a limit to the avail- ability of stock in any particu- lar company - something offi- cials at the TSE also point out. \"If there is a possibility of stock procurement difficulties in the near future, it is in our interest to prevent it,\" says Mr Kimura. Investors who sell a stock on margin will have to return the borrowed stock when the six-month margin period expires. A sharp rise in margin selling means that, at the end of six months, there will be a surge of buying and a possible shortage of stock. At a time when the authori- ties are moving toward deregu- lating Japan's financial mar- kets and removing business monopolies, it might seem strange that reviews of JSF's role in the stock market are not on the agenda. However, Mr Kimura con- tends that increasing competi- tion by setting up new securi- ties finance companies would only create confusion. \"Stock- holders who lend us the stocks do so because they trust us. They will not lend their stocks to just anyone.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London UK COMPANIES which account for convertible bonds as near-equity would have to revise their balance sheets to show new liabilities under new proposals made by the International Accounting Standards Committee. The IASC's exposure draft on accounting for financial instruments suggests that convertible bond issues should be accounted for partly as debt and partly as equity - \"split accounting\". At present, UK companies which have issued convertible capital bonds, ranging from Sainsbury and Tesco to Blue Circle Industries, often account for the proceeds as near- equity. They argue that the bonds will be converted into shares and offer holders something close to equity risk because they are deeply subordinated. Under the IASC proposal, they would be required to look at the cost of raising straight debt of the same maturity when the convertible bondwas launched and decide what portion of the proceedsof the convertible issueshould be included as a liability and what portion as near-equity. IASC standards have no formal authority in the UK. However, the UK Accounting Standards Board is expected to publish a discussion paper on the subject of debt and equity in November. The IASC exposure draft will increase pressure for the UK body to follow the route which argues that convertible bonds contain both a debt and an equity component. However, bankers said that there were considerable practical difficulties in deciding how much of a convertible issue should be considered debt and how much equity. \"It is difficult to assign verifiable values in practice to the debt and equity components,\" commented one banker. The IASC exposure draft also suggests: * Preference shares which are redeemable at the option of the holder should be accounted for as debt rather than equity, even if the legal form of the shares is equity. Again, the UK Accounting Standards Board is working on its own draft standard on the issue. * Securitised assets should not be removed from the balance sheet of a company where it is still exposed to \"risks and rewards\". These might include a residual risk of default on securitised mortgages which has not been fully passed on to the holders of mortgage-backed bonds. * Companies should only be allowed to offset financial risks where they have the legal right to offset those risks against each other in practice. Hence, financial risks on foreign exchange contracts undertaken with different counterparties could not always be offset.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent BELEAGUERED URANIUM producers, already suffering from extraordinarily low prices because of Soviet exports, face a new threat - better relations between the world's superpow- ers means that military stocks might now be sold. There is the equivalent of 250,000 tonnes of natural ura- nium, or five years' require- ments, in the military stocks of China, France, India, the UK and the US, according to a study published yesterday by the Uranium Institute. This new threat could hit the market just as its present prob lems begin to fade. The institute suggested there were at present up to 80,000 tonnes of surplus uranium stocks at power companies in North America, Western Europe and East Asia. That alone would be enough to cover the 52,000-tonnes gap between the 500,000 tonnes it forecasts will be required by nuclear reactors in the 1990s and the potential supply of 448,000 tonnes. In addition, producers in the western world also hold stocks equivalent to last year's depressed output of about 28,300 tonnes. This was 36 per cent below the 1980 peak and the lowest since 1977. Output this year is expected to be even lower at about 26,000 tonnes. Uranium has only one appli- cation - for nuclear energy. Demand depends entirely on nuclear generating capacity in the 25 countries using that Uranium proedution In the western world (thouand tonnes) 40 30 20 10 0 i form of power. Spot prices of uranium oxide are now well below the produc- tion costs of most mines at US$8.55 a lb. Prices peaked at US$45 a Ib in 1978. The market changed dramatically in the 1980s when brokers and other intermediaries began to act for their own accounts. By selling material from the huge stocks they have become important alternative suppliers. Producers themselves are taking advantage of low spot prices and are buying on the spot market rather than re- opening mines to meet their commitments. Mr Phillip Crowson, senior economic adviser to the RTZ Corporation, the world's larg- est mining company, suggested yesterday that the drawdown of stocks would continue to 1995, albeit at a slowing rate. Presenting a paper on supply and demand, prepared by him- self and Mr Wolf Gehrisch, the Institute's senior economist, Mr Crowson suggested it was unlikely that the Soviet Union and China would export more than their combined target of 6,000 tonnes of uranium a year, even though they obviously had the capacity to do so. \"There must be concern over security of supply and unease over political conditions which should ensure these goals are not greatly exceeded,\" he told the institute's annual sympo- sium in London. Then he raised the question of potential supply from mili- tary stocks. He said: \"We assume military uranium will not be a significant source for several years at least. But will this become the uranium industry's next Trojan horse?\"",

   "article_dc_title" : "Jamaican Company's Soviet Bauxite Deal 'Not Threatened'",
   "text_content" : "By Canute James in Kingston A JAMAICAN company that sells bauxite to the Soviet Union has denied a suggestion that its supply contract is in danger following recent devel- opments there. But it says it is watching the situation \"care fully\". The state-owned Bauxite and Alumina Trading Company (Batco) has a contract to sup ply 1m tonnes of ore a year over five years, starting this year. The agreement is expec- ted to earn the island about USS125m. Mr Audley Roberts, managing director of the com- pany, admitted that shipments to the Soviet Union were behind schedule, but he said that resulted from problems that arose before the start of present crisis. Earlier, Mr Ruel Cooke, a consultant with the Jamaican Bauxite Institute, suggested that Batco's contract was in danger because it had been agreed with a Soviet agency in Moscow, but that the ore was being used by a refinery in the Ukraine. Jamaican industry officials said that the future of the con- tract was secure as long as the Ukraine remained part of the Soviet Union. They said that if the Ukraine moved to indepen- dence either the contract would have to be renegotiated with that government, or the Soviet government would have to find another refinery that was technically able and will- ing to process the ore. Failing this, the contract would be threatened. Mr Roberts said there had been difficulties with the con- tract before the current wave of unrest. He said that the shipment of the ore had fallen behind schedule because the Soviet Union \"has recently been diverting their ships to earn hard currency\". The Soviet Union took deliv- ery of 30,000 tonnes instead of 250,000 tonnes in the first quar- ter of this year. A lack of hard currency to pay for the bauxite was reported by Jamaican offi- cials to be the cause. Discussions between repre- sentatives of both governments led to a resumption of ship- ments in June. Batco is proj- ecting that it will ship 180,000 tonnes of ore between this month and December. That would make total delivery of bauxite to the Soviet Union this year about 600,000 tonnes. \"The shortfall of 400,000 tonnes will represent a reve- nue shortfall of US$8.5m,\" the company said. And it will reduce the Jamaican industry's growth rate. Ore production in the first six months of this year was 5.53m tonnes, 1.4 per cent more than in the corresponding period of 1990. The Jamaica Bauxite Institute is forecasting 1991 production at 11.lm tonnes, 1.6 per cent more than actual output in 1990. Ore pro- duction in 1990 was 13.7 per cent more than in 1989.",

In New York the arabica market was looking for direction at midday, with traders reluctant to be short as they awaited further details of financing for the producers' stock retention plan. On the LME copper prices moved ahead on short-covering against a background of concern over the tightness of September delivery metal and the unrest in Zaire, which accounts for about 5 per cent of world production. Nickel retreated further, but closed above earlier 18-month lows. Further declines are expected, with physical supply likely to outpace demand in the final months of the year, while recent arrivals of Soviet metal Into Europe should show up in Rotterdam warehouses soon. Platinum lost Wednesday's gains on news that Impala had reopened the Bafokeng North mine which had been closed for just one day. Niymex platinum futures were also down at midday, weighed down by heavy Japanese investor selling.",

   "text_content" : "By Da vld lackwell THE RISE in cocoa prices over the past week or so might con- vince some of the delegates arriving at the annual meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) in London today that there is a break in the clouds of gloom that have enveloped the market for a couple of years. Both on the London and New York terminal markets, cocoa prices have advanced sharply by recent standards as players have become increas- ingly convinced that the 1991-92 season might be head- ing for the first supply deficit for eight years. Yesterday December cocoa closed at Â£747 a tonne, a rise of Â£66 from the .previous week . New York December cocoa closed at $1,190 a tonne on Wednesday, $118 ahead of Wednesday last week. Delegates are anxious to make progress at these talks after agreeing last June to set up a working party on the moribund cocoa agreement. The working party is open to ideas from anyone with a legit- imate interest in the cocoa market. However, the first meeting of the working group does not take place until the end of next week. The group will meet again at the beginning of December, followed by a further full council meeting of the organisation to discuss its findings. That leaves only routine business to be done today and next week, along with the familiar arguments that arise at every ICCO meeting - nota- bly over the 150m still owed by producer countries to the buffer stock. Even so analysts feel that the pact talks could add to the mildly bullish tone of the cocoa markets. But the main reason behind the rise in prices is a funda- mental change in the outlook for the supply and demand bal- ance. According to Mr Tony Chadwick, analyst with Pru- dential Bache, the deficit for 1991-1992 could be in the order of 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes. The fall in world cocoa prices to 16-year lows has left producers with little option but to cut the use of pesticides, ser- tilisers and even labour. In Brazil, where dry weather has compounded problems, witches broom and black pod disease have spread through planta- tions. According to GNI, the London futures broker, Brazil. ian production could fall to 270,000 tonnes 1991-92 com- pared with 365,000 tonnes this season. West African and Malaysian production is also seen falling. At the same time consump- tion continues to grow strongly. \"Grinding rates have been growing at an exceptional rate for 10 years and there is a strong likelihood of an 80,000 to 90,000-tonne expansion in global demand in 1991-92,\" says GNI. Mr Chadwick points out that Soviet consumption has fallen in the past two years from 200,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes. While it could still fall further, the potential for a revival in Soviet demand remains in the background. Similarly demand for chocolate could grow strongly in eastern Europe. The current season's surplus is put at 139,000 tonnes by Gill & Duffus, the London trader, and world stocks stand at 1.46m tonnes. While such an overhang will continue to keep the brakes on the cocoa market, GNI believes that \"with many producers probably oversold on forward contracts, nearby tightness may none the less push prices up to Â£1,000 a tonne by the year-end.\"",

   "text_content" : "HE WORLD cocoa mar- ket may be in a slump but Malaysia can still \"sell every bean we produce,\" says Mr Tay Eong Beok, dep- uty director-general of the Malaysian Cocoa Board, the country's powerful regulatory body. He heads the board's research division. With sales of the commodity being helped by a rapid growth in domestic cocoa processing capacity there has been none of the build-up in domestic stockpiles that has plagued other producers. Between 1988 and 1990, Malaysian grinding capacity rose by 50 per cent to 66,000 tonnes. This year, it is expec- ted to rise another 36 per cent to 90,000 tonnes. Counting 40,000 tonnes of capacity in neighbouring Singapore, facto- ries in the two countries will be absorbing nearly half of this year's output, forecast to rise to 280,000 tonnes from last year's 260,000 tonnes. Cocoa processors are dou- bling and trebling their capaci- ties because the pressing mar- gin (the price premium for cocoa butter over beans) has grown from two or three times the price of beans to four times. The boom among local cocoa processors contrasts sharply with depressed state of the commodity market, where low bean prices have encouraged stockpiling. One result has been a world- wide squeeze on supply of cocoa products, particularly butter. So European buyers have joined US chocolate max- ers as eager buyers of Malay- sian products, says Mr Alan Maclachlan, representative for E.D. & F. Man, the London- based commodity broker. Malaysian cocoa butter exports have been surging since 1989, when they far out- stripped a 2.3 per cent rise in world bean consumption to advance 22 per cent. About 75 per cent of locally-produced cocoa butter is sold to the Netherlands, the UK and the US. \"There is a lot of profit being made,\" says Mr Maclachlan, from the anomaly between prices of cocoa products and beans. \"It may be good for manufacturers but it is not healthy for the industry as a whole.\" Cocoa plantations, like Golden Hope (formerly Har- risons Malaysian), are respond- ing to the situation by raising their investments in cocoa grinding: the Malaysian gov- ernment has issued processing licences for 14 plants, on top of 10 already operating. But Mr Tay says that, in the short term, farmers can only com- pensate for low bean prices by raising their yields, although at nearly 700 kg a hectare the Malaysian average is already the highest in the world. The cocoa board is aiming for 1 tonne a hectare, not necessar- ily an unrealistic target as some well-managed plots already yield as much as 1.5 tonnes a hectare. This means that, even with- out further expansion of culti- vated land, Malaysia hopes to reach an output of 340,000 to 400,000 tonnes by 1995. But Mr Tay doubts that Malaysia can produce the volumes achieved by Ivory Coast because of a shortage of suitable land. Set up this year, the board has a 1989 parliamentary man- date to help reform cultivation and establish a system for the physical grading of beans. For this purpose the board issues a certificate, which gives quality a legal backing. The grading system involves six levels of physical quality standards, based on bean size uniformity (100 beans per 100 gram is optimum) and the level of mouldiness and other defects, says Mr M.J. Musa, also the board's deputy direc- tor-general. He heads the mar- keting and regulatory division. The board is critical of cur- rent international grading methods, which make little dis- tinction between the subjective standards of flavour and the tangible, physical quality. The establishment of the board is symbolic of Malaysia's determined push towards improving its regulatory and research work. Aside from these functions, its other main occupation is finding more food and non-food uses for cocoa. \"Most agricultural producers focus on production rather than industrial research,\" says Mr Tay. \"I think the Malaysian approach is the right way.\" Its ambition is to become a big market player not simply in cultivation but also in cocoa products manufacturing. These efforts are partly aimed at the Asian Pacific region. This is \"a brand new market\", says Mr Musa, who hopes to persuade the Chinese to drink as much cocoa as they do in tea. \"I think it is easier to convince them to switch to cocoa than to convince coffee drinkers,\" he says. While Swiss annual con- sumption of cocoa is 4 kg a head, the Japanese, who have equivalent income levels, con- sume just 600 grams each. China's consumption is just 200 grams a head. This, Mr Tay thinks, is a problem of image. Asians tend to regard cocoa as \"an expen- sive, imported product\", although just 10 to 12 per cent of the price of a chocolate bar represents the cost of the cocoa in it."

The executive committee of the 7-member ANRPC will alsc press for early renegotiation of the International Natural Rub- ber Agreement, a pact - due to expire in December 1993 - to maintain buffer stocks in order to stabilise prices. \"We want a new pact which provides better price mecha- nisms. The current agreement has failed to provide fair and remunerative prices for us,\" Mr Madjid said. The International Natural Rubber Organisation, which administers the agreement, will meet next month in Malay- sia to consider renegotiating the agreement.",

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto CANADA'S PRAIRIE wheat harvest is expected to be some- what lower than last year, despite near-record yields in the key province of Saskatch- ewan. With more than half the crop now harvested, the Department of Agriculture has forecast a total yield from the three western provinces of 29.6m tonnes, down from 31.1m tonnes last season. The relatively large harvest has failed, however, to lift the sombre mood among Canadian grain farmers caused by low world prices. Canada is the world's third biggest wheat exporter, after the US and the European Community, and regards itself as one of the chief victims of the wheat sub- sidy war. The Canadian Wheat Board last month lowered ini- tial payments to producers for the current crop year to C$95 (Â£50) a tonne, from C$135 last season. Mr Gordon Reichert, an Agri- culture Canada forecaster in Winnipeg, said the drop was mainly due to an expected 1.2m-tonne fall in the harvest in Manitoba, where excess moisture early in the season damaged parts of the crop. The prairie barley harvest is expected to fall to 12.6m tonnes from 12.9m tonnes. But the canola (rapeseed) crop is set to balloon to 4.3m tonnes from 3.2m tonnes, thanks to a 24 per cent increase in acreage. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool said it expected the prov- ince's grain harvest to total 24.8m tonnes, the second larg- est on record. Spring wheat will contribute 14.5m tonnes and durum wheat 3.5m tonnes. The Pool said that dry weather had allowed farmers to make \"excellent progress\" in bring- ing in the harvest.",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR was firm ahead of today's US employment report, while sterling had a good tone despite Wednesday's cut in British interest rates and expectations of further reductions. Dollar sentiment has been weak since the currency failed to gain support from a strong August purchasing managers (NAPM) index and July con- struction spending on Tuesday, but there was a move to cover short positions yesterday ahead of the employment fig- ures. A rise to 6.9 from 6.8 per cent in the August unemployment rate has been generally fore- cast, but there are wide varia- tions in expectations of non- farm payrolls. A similar figure to July's fall of 51,000 would prompt speculation about lower US interest rates and weaken the dollar, but most economists are looking for an increase. The median of mar- ket forecasts is for a rise of about 50,000. Comments yesterday by Mr John Laware, a Federal Reserve Board governor, were encouraging. He said the US economy is in the early stages of recovery and predicted that real gross national product will expand at 3 to 4 per cent dur- ing the second half of the year.

On Bank of England figures the dollar's index rose to 66.3 from 66.2. Sterling showed no sign of political nervousness, as specu lation built up about a possible UK general election in Novem- ber. In fact the pound appeared to be supported by the political situation following an opinion poll last week-end giving the ruling Conservatives a lead over the Labour Party. This week's reduction in UK bank base rates and expecta tions of another cut in the near future have not had an adverse impact on sterling. The market has taken the view that lower rates will increase the chances of the present government remaining in power, and it therefore reduces the political risk of holding the currency.

The pound's index was unchanged through- out at 91.0. The only change in position among members of the Euro- pean exchange rate mechanism was sterling's move up above the Irish punt in the grid. Trad- ing was quiet in the ERM, with the D-Mark steady in the mid- dle of the system and the French franc anchored at the bottom. The D-Mark eased to FFr3.3972 from FFr3.3986 at the Paris fixing. A factor causing some distor- tion to currency trading at present is demand for the yen by Japanese companies, repat- riating funds to Tokyo ahead of this month's financial half- year end. This is keeping the yen relatively firm although there was no obvious indepen- dent move by the currency yes- terday."

   "text_content" : "INTEREST RATES eased on the London money market yes- terday as speculation contin- ued that the UK Conservative government is creating an opportunity to hold a general election this year. It was suggested that this may involve another cut in bank base rates around the time of the Conservative Party conference and publication of September's UK retail price index in October. Next Friday's data are expec- ted to show that August year- on-year inflation fell to around 4.7 from 5.5 per cent and for September it is hoped the fig- ure will be under 4 per cent.

Dy4oey mcnadit vairnry short supply on the cash market, but most of the shortage was absorbed by an early round of official help. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Â£1,550m. This was revised to Â£1,500m at noon and to Â£1,450m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Â£1,450m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Â£1,270m bills, including Â£7C8m outright, by way of lÂ£9bm Treasury bills in band 1 at 10% per cent and Â£586m bank bills in band 1 at 10% per cent. Another Â£486m bills were purchased for resale to the market in equal amounts on Settember 25 and 26 at an interest rate of l0-1Oi0 per cent. There was no further intervention before lunch, but in the afternoon RI8m bank bills were bought in band 1 at 10% percent.

   "text_content" : "Wal Street TRADING WAS subdued for a second day on Wall Street as the market continued to wait for today's employment figures for August which should give more evidence of the state of the US economy, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged on the day, closing at 3,008.5 on mod- erate volume of 171m shares. The Standard & Poors 500 was off 0.83 at 389.14. Among featured issues, IBP tumbled $21% to $16% in active trading after Occidental Petro- leum said that it would sell its 51 per cent stake in the com- NYSE volume Daily (million) 350 300 250 200 150 100 22 2326272829302 3 4 5 August 1991 Sep pany in the form of a rights offering that will allow holders to buy IBP shares for $15 apiece. Shares in Occidental eased $% to $24%. Borden dropped $2% to $33% on expectations that the com- pany's third and fourth quarter earnings will decline if recess- ionary pressures continue. Shares in Heinz slid $2% to $41 on reports that analysts expected the price to fall. Recent takeover rumours have bolstered the stock. International Specialty Prod- ucts dropped $1% to $16% after Merrill Lynch cut its earnings estimates for the company. Merrill Lynch, underwriter for the company's initial public offering in June, is concerned about flat sales. Aydin dropped $2% to $23. A 500,000-share offering was priced at $238/%. Browning Ferris, the second biggest US waste management company, whose stock has been hit by its gloomy fourth quarter earnings projections, recouped some of its recent losses, adding $% to $21/%. Waste Management, however, eased $% to $37%. Beazer's American Deposi- tory Receipts climbed $% to $6%I in active trading amid expectations that the compa- ny's banks were close to approving a plan to spin off some of its European assets. Beazer would not comment on the stock activity but said it would soon publish its earn- ings for the year ended June 30 and give shareholders updated information on negotiations on its restructured bank facility and the status of its proposed floatation of CHB Group. Among active blue chips, PepsiCo fell $1% to $29% after an analyst at Salomon Brothers repeated a rating of underperformance, although earnings projections have held steady. Boeing climbed $1% to $52 Va. Canada TORONTO SHARE prices ended steady in light trading. According to preliminary data, the composite index fell 1.35 points, closing at 3,485.49, with declining issues beating advances 275 to 220. Volume of 20m shares dropped from yes- terday's 22.24m shares, and trading value fell to C$234.2m from C$271.7m. Eight of 14 sub-groups ended lower, led by transportation issues, off 2.4 per cent on index. In that group, Laidlaw 'B' stock fell C$/% to C$12%, and the 'A' stock fell C$% to C$12%. Gold was off 1.2per cent on index. Consumer prod- ucts and energy issues ended steady. Financial services closed up 0.6 per cent, while industrial products were slightly higher. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, up C$% to C$32%1/, said it had flat third-quarter earnings of 96 cents a share, compared with 97 cents a year ear\"ier.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo LOWER short-term interest rates and the higher yen sup- ported share prices yesterday, with volume rising above 400m shares for the first time in nearly two months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 96.96 at 22,499.65, after a day's high of 22,620.64 and a low of 22,369.67. Volume grew from 350m to 450m shares on activ- ity by foreign investors, arbi- trageurs and individuals. Insti- tutional investors were also seen cross-trading to secure profits ahead of the September book closing. Advances outnumbered declines by 625 to 330, with 161 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first sec- tion stocks put on 9.70 to 1,749.39, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 6.48 to 1,332.24. Lower short-term interest rates encouraged hopes of an imminent discount rate cut. The overnight call rate, which fell from 7.5 to 7.24 per cent on Wednesday, hovered around 7.25 per cent throughout the day. Traders said this con- firmed the central bank's dis- count rate intentions. The recovery in volume reflected an improvement in sentiment. Individual inves- tors, who had been net sellers for the past few months, were seen buying in small lots. For- eigners continued to purchase actively. Large-capital shares were heavily traded on the lower short-term rates. NKK advanced Y13 to Y400 and Ishi- kawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Y26 to Y667. Foreigners bought shipbuild- ers. Mitsui Shipbuilding climbed Y13 to Y592 and Hitachi Zosen Y19 to Y666. On the negative side, Mitsu- bishi Material, the most active issue of the day, lost Y20 to Y585 on speculation of lower earnings, after an announce- ment that it would report revised earnings projections after the market had closed. Trading in the issue was briefly suspended in the after- noon owing to the heavy trad- ing. The company later said pre-tax profits would fall 16 per cent this year; it had previ- ously forecast a 5 per cent rise. Automobile issues were weaker, hit by a 12.6 per cent year-on-year decline in sales of small cars. Investors saw the new tightened car parking law as an additional negative sac- tor. Toyota Motor fell Y20 to Y1,530 and Honda Motor retreated Y20 to Y1,480. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 163.23 to 24,646.01. Volume was 86.8m shares, the heaviest since March, on buying of earnings-backed issues and low-priced large-capital stocks. Rohm, the linear integrated circuit maker, moved ahead Y280 to Y2,880 on reports of an upward revision of earnings for the current year to March 1992 to a 60 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Y13bn. Roundup WITHIN narrow limits, the Pacific Rim put on a mixed performance yesterday. SEOUL reversed Wednes- day's recovery on tight liquid- ity in the market, rising infla- tion and an expanding current account deficit. The composite index receded 8.73 to 674.81 in turnover down from Won335bn to Wonl72bn. NEW ZEALAND closed off earlier highs, but the NZSE-40 index still added 5.77 at 1,432.15 after an initial burst of foreign buying orders. Turnover expanded from Wednesday's NZ$17.9m to NZ$19.3m. TAIWAN was narrowly higher in thin trade. The rise was mainly attributed to short- covering and limited bargain hunting as the weighted index inched up 7.11 to 4,515.37 after a loss of 117.33 on Wednesday. Turnover shrank from T$23.2bn to TS14.8bn. Apart from the failure of the central bank to reduce its rediscount rate, investors were worried about the possibilities of confrontation in an island- wide demonstration to be held this Sunday by the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's largest opposition group. HONG KONG continued to consolidate, the Hang Seng index slipping 16.29 to 3,990.16 in HK$1.14bn turnover, against Wednesday's HK$1.0Bbn. SINGAPORE closed softer, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 4.93 to 1,421.49, and KUALA LUMPUR saw par- ticularly choppy trading, before the composite index ended 0.67 higher at 562.50. AUSTRALIA finished off the day's high, with the All Ordi- naries index 3.7 up at 1,571.1.",

   "text_content" : "RENCH DRUG company shares received a tonic recently from govern- ment plans to reform pharma- ceutical policy. If adopted, the plans, which were drawn up by Mr Bruno Durieux, the health minister, and Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, social affairs minister, will lead to a rise in drug prices, curb drug makers' publicity budgets and encourage them to spend more on research and develop- ment (R&D). The broad aim is to encour- age the French pharmaceutical industry - which is still more dependent on its home market than are its main counterparts - to be more competitive internationally. It also aims to limit domestic drug consump- tion, which is among the high- est per person in the world. General outlines were dis- cussed at a cabinet meeting at the end of last month. Details are due to be settled at next week's cabinet session for pre- sentation to parliament in October, so that they can take effect next year. The proposals received an Index & share prides ebased 120 115 110 105 100. soumcem: Dtngm enthusiastic response in a radio interview last week from Mr Lolk Le Floch Prigent, chairman of Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group which con- trols Sanofi. \"If we could ever fnd an intelligent and negoti- ated way to reduce promot- ional expenses, we would be delighted because we would increase our research spend- ing,\" he said. This was accompanied by a share price rally across the sec- tor, surprising some analysts who argue that the benefits will not show in company prof- its for several years. Yesterday, the share prices of Sanofi and Rh6ne-Poulenc stood 2 per cent higher than their August 29 level, in spite of declines this week. Over the same period, the Institut M6rieux share price was up 9 per cent, Roussel-Uclaf 7 per cent and Synth6labo 5 per cent, compared with a rise of only 0.6 per ce nt in the CAC 40 stock market index. The scheme comes as a relief to the mostly state-controlled French drugs industry, after a period when the government has been it to help curb this year's security bud- get deficit, by imposing tax increases on drug publicity spending and price cuts for some pharmaceuticals. The government has also removed so-called anti-asthenics or ton- ics from the list of drugs for which patients can claim state reimbursements, which still remains - with roughly 12,000 products - nearly twice the length of the UK list of reim- bursable pharmaceuticals. Under the proposals, prices of drugs - one of the few prod- ucts still subject to price controls in France - would be more in line with European levels, says the prime minis- ter's office. This would apply to- \"innovative drugs\" only, but implies significant increases considering that French drug prices are on average 30 per cent below the Euronean Community average, according to one survey. It is understood that compa- nies would have more flexibl- ity In deciding prices, by being given an average ceiling for their whole range of products, rather than being given set prices for individual drugs. It is suggested that the increase in the state health bill created by price rises for reim- bursable drugs would be offset by another roxind of delisting of non-essential medicines. he government also says prices would be fixed in order to encour- age R&D, which stockbroking analysts take to mean that companies with high R&D would be allowed to charge more for their drugs. In addition, the state would limit individual companies' promotional budgets, which currently average 18 per cent of sales across the industry, as against R&D spending of 12.5 per cent of turnover. There would also be a central drug licensing agency. Mr Andrew Tivernen, ana- lyst at James Capel, argues that the recent share price rise is overdone and that drug com- panies will feel the effects of this year's health spending curbs before the wider margins implied by the price reform package come through. If the plan succeeds in improving French drug compa- nies' research, this could make the larger players more attrac- tive partners for the kinds of international alliances they are already making in growing numbers, argues Mr Mark Tracey, analyst at Paribas. This includes, over the past year alone, Rh6ne-Poulenc's acquisition of Rorer, of the US, and Sanofi's co-operation deal with Sterling Drug, of the US. Another likely consequence is a reduction, possibly through mergers and take- overs, in the number of small and medium-sized French drug producers, say analysts. The victims will be unable to sup- port large research bills and will be dependent on the kind of non-essential drugs that the government may have in mind for removing from the list of reimbursable products.",

   "text_content" : "BOURSES MARKED time yesterday, although Wall Street's opening rise helped some of the late-closers to end at their best levels of the day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT virtually stood still, the FAZ index losing 0.35 to 681.57 at midsession and the DAX 0.74 to 1,647.17 at the close. Volume rose from DM2.7bn to a still-derisory DM2.9bn. Wednesday's news that the IG Metall union is to seek a 10 per cent wage rise for Volkswa- gen workers - after the 10.5 per cent claim on which negoti- ations began with insurance companies this week - did not seem to hurt VW, which rose 20 pfg to DM385.50. However, Mr James Cornish, a strategist with County Nat- west, said that the VW claim could be more successful than some, given the launch of the new Golf model. He added that there were signs that the Ger- man economy is not growing as feebly as some economists had expected in the second half of 1991; and that there could be trouble with the Bundesbank this autumn, given its rise of only 25 basis points in the Lombard rate in August. There was a flurry in steels, as Hoesch rose DM7.80 to DM300.30 and speculators turned their attention to Klockner-Werke, rather than the UK's British Steel, as a pos- sible marriage partner. K-W, too, showed an increase, closing DM3.30 higher at DM148.30. Traders justified this by saying that a merged group would have more critical mass, raising the spectres of 'industrial logic', which afflicted British industrial poli- tics in the 1960s, and 'synergy', which held sway 20 years later. All this was so exciting that Preussag, which owns the Salz- gitter steel operation, rose DM6.50 to DM309 and Thyssen added DM2.30 to DM238.30. Another speculative favourite, tyremaker Continental, put on DM2.60 to DM225.80 for a three- day gain of DM10.80.

Turnover was fairly heavy, rising from FFrl.9bn to about FFr2.2bn. The total included FFr580m worth of trading in LVMH as it went ex a one-for-10 scrip issue. Oil refiners were boosted by Wednesday's first-half figures from Total. The Total share price rose FFr46 or 5.4 per cent to FFr894 in the day's second highest turnover of FFrl51m. BP France gained FFr9 or 8 per cent to FFr121 and Esso added FFr32 or 5.4 per cent to FFr625. Fives Lille jumped FFr30 or 11.8 per cent to FFr284 on unusually strong volume of 109,850 shares, after the hold- ing company forecast 1991 prof its of FFrl60m rising to FFr250m in 1994, following its loss of FFr236m in 1990. Michelin, the tyremaker, was also firm, rising FFr6 to FFr124.90 in 345,366 shares. AMSTERDAM closed at its session high in moderate trad ing, with the CBS tendency index up 0.7 at 92.5. Ahold, the retailer, gained Fl 2.60 or 3.3 per cent to Si 82.50, after it announced a 10 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits. Internationale Nederlanden, the newly merged banking and insurance group, rose 60 cents to F149.30 before it announced first-half net profits at the top end of analysts' forecasts. MILAN was flat, the Comit index easing 1.52 to 555.29 as stockbrokers said that settle- ment of the August trading account, already delayed by one week owing to Milan's lat- est stock trading scandal, will now take place next week. Banks settled back as buying interest dried up, BCI falling L70 to IA,800 and Credito Itali- ano L41 to L2,640. Fiat lost L47 to L5,638; while Italian car sales rose in July and August, Fiat's share of the market fell from 45.3 to 38.3 per cent last month, against 46.6 per cent in August, 1990. ZURICH was sluggish, although a first-half operating loss of around SFr200m at Oer- likon-Bfihrle left the arms and engineering group SFr7 lower at SFr405. The Crddit Suisse index rose 0.2 to 534.9. STOCKHOLM edged higher on foreign blue-chip buying. The Affirsvarlden General index added 3.5 to 1,065.0. Turnover grew from SKr382m to SKr579m, boosted by a SKrl79m deal in Volvo B shares, which rose SKr5 to SKr355. MADRID was barely changed, as the general index slipped 0.27 to 274.35 in light turnover of about Pta9bn. VIENNA stayed firm on for- eign buying, the ATX 18-share index rising another 18.06 to 1,143.97. OMV, the state-con- trolled oil group, rose Sch21 to Schl,032 on a 29 per cent rise in first-half profits. ISTANBUL dropped 3 per cent, with the 75-share index down 93.13 at 2,987.52.",

UK Stock Market Editor FURTHER consideration overnight of the latest cut in domestic base rates failed yes- terday to ignite a UK stock market unsettled by sugges- tions that share prices might have overrun themselves or the present. Hints of the Impending publication of an opinion pol indicating sub- stantially increased support for the Conservative government helped share prices to steady towards the close of trading. After moving narrowly around overnight levels, the FT-SE Index closed last night at 2,6863.3, with the loss of 13 on the day relecting mixed for- tunes for the blue chip stocks. Seaq.reported trading volume showed only a modest fall at 457.9m shares against 507.7m in the previous session; but trad- ers said the balance had tipped A Sp 2 Soep 1 Aumg Sep13 Sep27 towards retall, or customer, activity. According to institu- tlonal dealers, fund were responding to from equity strategists that the market might have limited fur- ther upside at resent by switching into stocks regarded as likely to hold on to current levels. Beneficiaries from these tac- tics included Grand Metropoll- tan, which was strongly recom- mended by Panmure Gordon, Iud Glazo, which has moved erratically recently and is aow seen as offering a -buying uchofl thei attention focaued around the day's 114 01 company profits news, although in the event thiere were few surprises on this score. Sun Allance stead following its dividend and - its statement, but other insur- ance issues were uncertain after reports, late in the day of staff lay-offs at a leading ie company. The possibility of a UK en- eral election in November, prompted by the latest reduc- tion in domestic interest rates and the prospect of a further half-point cut very soon, pro- vided a fresh cause for uncer- tainty among investors. \"We are now in for a season fiirumours about impendiA- pinion poll readings,\" com- mented one l iganaly ome swcuritiies yea a Y -e 4A dusted off their forcasts *f the likely effects on the ock market o, respectively.

There was no conflrm- tion last night of reports that this morning would bring news 6f an opinion poll result vwouring the governing Co-n ervative party. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss irnbull agreed that the latest cut in base rates will be aen Sincreasing \"the political risk Sthe market\". However, he oined with others in the stock market in suggesting that th government was sti in a posi- ion to postpone a general elec- ion until June next year. The strategy team at County NatWest, noting that the lack- nstre response to this week's oase rate cut confirms that the market was \"wll up with the Ownewe\", held to I orecast &hat a Footsie at 2,700 will prove a high hurdle for the -aus term. There re few sllens in the market yesterday and equity analysts hesitated to suggest that the bull phase for sehanes was over just yet. At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Simon Williams pointed out.that com- pain, have largely protected ividend groth during the recession in the UK. Kleinwort Benson remains confident that the Footsie Index will achieve the firm's six-month target of 3,000 which, it believes, could be atta ined by the end of the year.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Switch Boosts Glaxo",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "GLAXO, which is expected to report healthy full-year profits next Thursday, bucked the easier trend of international stocks yesterday by recording a rise of 20 at 1365p. The mar- ket's attention was attracted by a weighty analysis from securities house Lehman Brothers, which apparently prompted a switch by institu- tions from Rothmans, down 16 at 1070p. Lehman had sent out a 470- page review of the world drug industry which looked at 140 companies. The review con- cluded that by the year 2,000 Glaxo would be one of the four companies to market the most significant drugs. The broker was modest about the note, arguing it \"merely confirms that Glaxo is one of the most innovative drug companies\". However, the sharp rise in the shares was fuelled by a report from Reuters' wire ser- vice yesterday, which said Glaxo would be one of two \"biggest winners in the race to develop blockbuster drugs by the year 2000\". The report describes blockbuster drugs as those with global sales of more than $500m (Â£295.8m) a year. Sun Alliance rallies Sun Alliance closed the com- posite insurance sector report- ing season with disappointing half-time figures, but calmed the market with a 5 per cent rise in the interim dividend and indicated an increase in the final dividend. Sun's interim losses came out at Â£114m, only modestly below a comparable figure of Â£119m last year, and were inflated by Â£50m-worth of losses in the group's mortgage indemnity business. The stock fell away to 370p in the wake of the losses that had taken many analysts by surprise. But dealers edged the share price higher after what was described as a reas- suring post-results meeting with analysts. At the close the shares were a penny up on bal- ance at 377p. Most analysts expect Sun Alliance to report a full-year loss of between Â£180m and Â£200m to accommodate a sharply increased mortgage indemnity loss of around Â£150m for the period. Mr Andrew Goodwin, com- posite specialist at UBS Phillips & Drew is looking for a full-year loss of Â£195m but expects the dividend total to be raised by 7 per cent. The UBS analyst said he expected the shares to drift back in the short term but labelled the stock a long-term hold \"given the strong dividend-paying capacity\". BTR volatile Confusion over BTR's interim results prompted vola- tile performance in the share price. At first glance, the pre- tax figure of Â£512m coupled with a raised dividend seemed surprisingly good and the shares moved ahead 9. How- ever, when analysts left the meeting with the company, it was appreciated by the market that the profits were boosted by the recent Â£90m gain on the disposal of Pretty Polly, BTR's hosiery subsidiary, and the shares retreated. The realisation that underly- ing profits were really far lower was coupled with a state- ment from the chairman that \"in the UK the construction and allied markets continued their downward trend, posing difficulties to our companies\". The shares ended a net 5 down at 424p after turnover of 6.9m. At least one analyst felt the company had \"shot itself in the foot\" with the way it presented its accounts, because once the poor results from BTR's Aus- tralian subsidiary BTR Nylex were stripped out the profits were ultimately encouraging. Allied-Lyons added 4 at 619p on turnover of 4m as it contin- ued to attract bid speculation. Trade was enlivened by talk that executives of US brewer Anheuser Busch, recently con- sidered a potential bidder, had visited one of the group's brew- eries. However, many believe that if such a visit had taken place its aim was more likely to have been discussion of the NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 N EWM (1) aMTI Pums(Ms Tre. 8pc 1092. Tr o10iap Cv 1992.

Among second-line brewers, a bear squeeze was noted in Vaux, which rose 11 to 240p. Wolverhampton & Dudley shares were wanted and appre- ciated 6 to 573p. Lloyds Bank ran up 9 to 399p on keen turnover of 3.4m as strong demand followed pre- sentations by Hoare Govett and suggestions that the bank may be about to sell its New Zealand banking interest to Westpac, the leading Austra- lian bank. Reckitt& Colman was firm in early trading as the market responded to interim results that came in above the top end of expectations. However, at its meeting with analysts the management signalled addi- tional launch costs and said it saw no signs of recovery. After being up 15 at one stage, the shares closed off 5 on the day at 721p after turnover of 1.1m, high for the stock. Investors took note of the outperformance of ICI and the shares dipped 15 to 1346p. Nomura Research became a seller of the stock this week, arguing that the price ignored warning signals from the Ger- man majors which reported interims last week. Burmah-Castrol put on 9 to 598p in spite of a wave of full- year earnings downgrades after the interim figures, described by specialists as \"predictably poor\". The rise in the shares was attributed to the absence of a rights issue. However, analysts pointed to the unchanged dividend and 71 per cent gearing and said the share price was \"up with events\". The majors were unsettled by two developments. Iraq is to be allowed to export 750,000 barrels of oil a day, & Colman. Do. 9a5pc Cv. Bond, Scaps Securty AiMv Sero. Son Healhcan. Shaetla McEwan.

BP shares were additionally restrained by a bearish note issued by Strauss Turnbull and closed unaltered at 848p. A flurry of buying interest late in the session drove Beazer shares 11 higher to 94p; turnover reached a much-heav- ier than usual 10m. Details of the flotation of C.H. Beazer, encompassing Beazer's non-US businesses, are expected shortly. Blue Circle Industries edged up 3 to 271p as the market absorbed the figures, the absence of a cash call widely suggested in the press, and what was described as a posi- tive post-figures meeting with building analysts. Wilson Bowden advanced 10 to 485p after delivering a rare achievement in the sector, an increase in profits. The com- pany's profits improved from Â£15.2m to Â£15.4m and the interim dividend was lifted from 2.4p to 25p. A sharp fall in Cookson's interim profits had been antici- pated and the shares gained a penny to 129p. However, observers are divided over the company's prospects, and the range of forecasts for next year's full profits is said to be between Â£90m and Â£155m. Interim figures for Court- aulds Textiles were only mar- ginally ahead of forecasts, but the higher dividend signalled confidence for next year and the shares jumped 14 to 410p. Ebto climbed 14 to 212p on renewed bid speculation. The shares have risen by more than 15 per cent since last week's announcement that Oceana, of South Africa, had gained only 83.6 per cent of the company in its I5p per share offer. Wickes was also sought, advancing 6 to 70p. Booker lost 4 to 472p after announcing interim profits up Â£1.7m at Â£837Am, in line with analysts' forecasts. The shares initially moved ahead but then retreated as the company expressed caution on catering, distribution and the salmon price. Analysts lowered their forecasts for the full year slightly and estimates are now in a range of E10m to Â£112m against Â£110m to Â£115m previously. Dalgety slipped 9 to 429p on unease before its final results, due on September 16. Profits of around Â£110m are expected, compared with Â£118m last time. Sidlaw, the Scottish-based group which provides logistical services to the oil and gas dril- ling industry, moved up a fur- ther 6 to 206p. British Airways advanced 9 to 190p as 8.5m shares changed hands amid widespread reports of buying by UBS Phillips &Drew and scattered sugges- tions of interest by European institutions. Turnover was boosted by a late trade of 4m shares which was recorded on the Seaq screens at 198p.

   "text_content" : "A PROGRAMME trade was executed in the options market yesterday for the first time in almost three years, raising hopes that investor Interest is begining to stir in the depressed traded options mar- ket, writes Jim McCallum. The transaction was spread across 60 stock options and amounted to 3,000 contracts or am shares. The programme was weighted towards the sell side. All the options were at- the-money calls, which makes them a close substitute for stock. According to Socidt6 G6enr- me Strauss Turnbull the trade took a neutral view on the immediate outlook for the stock market. But the illiqund- ity in some stock options made some parts of the trade more difficult to execute. Elsewhere on the options market, buyers of BT Novem- ber 390 and 420 puts and sell ern of 420 calls helped to depress the shares in the wake of BTR's interim results. The equity futures market was taking a more cautious outlook on the immediate prospects for the share market after its recent gains. The September FT-SE closed at 2,682, up 3 points. Its pre- mium to the spot index ended at 19 points, against fair value of 10, which dealers said was neutral to mildly bullish.",
