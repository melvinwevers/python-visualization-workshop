   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff A SHARP fall in UK core inflation was reported yester- day, giving the government further encouragement on the economy and raising specula- tion that it would try to hasten a pre-election recovery with another interest rate cut. The Bank of England attempted to suppress market expectation that a reduction in the bank base rate could come so soon after last week's sur- prise half-point cut to 10.5 per cent. Though the Bank deliber- ately kept the money market short of funds, this failed to stop the three-month interbank rate from closing at around 10&A per cent, below the current level of base rates. Labour yesterday taciti acknowledged that a recover might be under way by droi ping its sceptical stance abou the upturn. In speeches by M Neil Kinnock, the party leadei and Mrs Margaret Beckett, th shadow chief secretary to th Treasury, the opposition sil nailed a tactical switch in it earlier criticism of the goverr ment and began warning of new \"boom-and-bust\" cycle. Hopes of an easing in mom tary conditions were ignited b: clear evidence that underlyha inflationary pressures in th economy were subsiding ral idly.

   "text_content" : "By Chris Tighe and Ralph Atkins POLICE were last night dismantling barricades and dis- persing crowds in an attempt to prevent a repetition of Mon- day night's rioting on the trou- bled Meadow Well estate in North Shields. The government earlier rejected charges that the riot- ing had been the consequence of its social policies and Mr John Major received a Home Office report arguing that the violence had erupted spontane- ously. Four people were arrested last night on the Meadow Well estate for'the alleged posses- sion of offensive Vaipohs and sent to different police stations in the area. During the late evening police received calls from local people reporting cars being set on fire and youths gathering but a police spokeswoman said the situation was relatively calm. Seven people had earlier been arrested in connection with the previous night's dis- turbances. Home Office officials described the events of Monday night as an \"operational mat- ter\" for the police.

It is just not an 9- acceptable way for people to behave.\" Is On Monday night about 200 iy police, including members of it- the Special Patrol Group, struggled to bring the riot n, under controL Many local people claimed the police had avoided the area for five hours while the riot was in progress - an allega- tion denied by police. The sister-in-law of one Asian shopkeeper said she was told \"we can't do anything\" when she repeatedly rang the police, in response to a call for help from her terrified rela- tives. Mr Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North, said the rioting in North Shields showed \"law and order has broken down and that crime is out of control in many parts of the region\". This week, Nor- 1 thumbria reported crime levels I k among the highest in Britain. 1 t Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow i home secretary, said the public 1 had to be defended but i e believed that, at least in part, s \"these outrages were a product 1 I of the despair that comes from i i unemployment\". r In his report to the prime I minister, Mr Kenneth Baker, i home secretary, backed the r action taken by Sir Stanley I Bailey, chief constable of Nor- 1 3 thumbrla, who was praised by i s Home Office officials for his i s commitment to community f policing. Sir Stanley said the police had deliberately avoided injury to police or civilians. \"I would much rather we kept the iron fist inside the velvet glove,\" he said. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, called for more resources for the police. \"We have to provide them with the resources to do the Job that is necessary to preserve law and order,\" he said. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, described the attacks as a \"criminal attack on the com- munity\" and hoped the police would catch the ringleaders. Deprivations, Page 9",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Donkin, in Abu Dhabi and David Laselles in London A KEY Abu Dhabi government department, headed by an offi- cial singled out in a report to the Bank of England as having knowledge of the fraud more than 18 months ago, was behind the detention of 36 senior executives of the Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter- national at the weekend. According to one source familiar with the Abu Dhabi financial establishment Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler, has taken personal control of the handling of the BCCI affair, deciding to move against many of the principal figures in the bank. These include Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief execu- tive of BCCI, who was among those arrested on Sunday. As police released 12 of those originally detained, the round-up was being interpreted by some of the remaining BCCI managers as a purge of the bank's Pakistani hierarchy and the boldest attempt yet by the Abu Dhabi authorities to dis- tance themselves from the scandal. The list of senior executives held for police questioning about their involvement in the fraud was drawn up within the Department of Personal Affairs. The department is headed by Mr Ghanem Faris al Mazrui, the only one of Sheikh Zayed's advisers singled out by Price Waterhouse in its June 22 report to the Bank England as knowing about the fraud. Mr Mazrui, Abu Dhabi's sole representative on the main board of BCCI, appears to have the complete trust of the Nahyan family. The Price Waterhouse report alleged he was involved in the illegal inflation of BCCI's share base. His signature also appeared on the confirmation document of a fictitious loan although he had said his name might have been forged. An Abu Dhabi official main- tained that the police hit list was drawn up by lawyers and accountants. But a BCCI insider said the main responsi- bility for compiling the list rested with Mr David Young- man, a former Ernst & Young accountant who now works in Mr Mazrui's department. Abu Dhabi law allows the Continued on Page 20 Elder statesman, Page 10 BCCI Continued from Page 1 detainees to be held for seven days before the police must seek permission from the Min- istry of Justice to extend their investigation for 21 days before charges must be laid or the suspects released.

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow SOVIET business leaders yesterday pleaded with the republics to postpone their drive towards independence in order to conclude a strong eco- nomic agreement which would moderate the effects of the cri- sis. \"Independence today is not as important as the economic issue because people must live better, both today and tomor- row,\" said Professor Yevgeny Yasin, economic adviser to the Scientific Industrial League, which represents state and pri- vate enterprises. The appeal to the republics comes amid a struggle within the interim government over whether it will be possible to keep the Soviet economy func- tioning while economic and political authority is devolved to the republics. Mr Arkady Volsky, SIL chairman, is also deputy chair- man of the Committee for the Management of the National Economy, which now carries on the day-to-day business of Union government. Prof Yasin has worked with Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, also a member of the committee, on a plan for an inter-republican economic agreement which calls for a common monetary, fiscal and banking policy between those republics signing the agree- ment. Mr Volsky and Prof Yasin said that, without a strong cen- tral authority, reform was impossible. They contrasted the Yavlinsky plan with that proposed by Professor Stani- slav Shatalin, author of last year's 500-day plan for radical reform, which calls for a loose association in which republics could retain their own curren- cies and monetary pro- grammes. Mr Yavlinsky's plan, details of which were printed in the newspaper Izvestia last night, proposes the retention of a common currency, common rules for economic activity, a common credit policy and a rapid transition to free prices and to opening up republics to the world market. When asked if the Soviet Union would have to seek rescheduling of its debt, Prof Yasin said \"it would do every- thing possible not to - but we hope we may get some agree-. ment from foreign partners to postpone part of our debt servi- cing\". His remark adds to the impression that debt reschedul- ing is now a live issue among the Soviet authorities, even though it is still said to be a last resort. Current debt servic- ing is running at about $15bn (Â£8.8bn) annually. Meanwhile, a further indica- tion of the disintegration of the Union came yesterday when a senior central banker warned that republics might begin to sell gold independently. Mr Eduard Gostev, deputy chairman of Vneshekonom- bank, the foreign trade bank, told the official news agency Tass that \"hasty, unco-ordi- nated activities could very eas- ily spoil the market and lead to a fall in the prices for gold\". The deputy chairman was reacting to reports that Uzbeki- stan, a Central Asian republic which has recently declared independence and which accounts for a third of Soviet gold production, had passed a law allowing it to create its own gold reserves."

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington MR James Baker, US secretary of state, last night pledged that the US would offer direct eco- nomic aid to the Soviet Union on condition that the new lead- ership offered a clear commit- ment to economic reform. Mr Baker's statement en route to Moscow, where he is due to have talks this week, represents a marginal shift in the Bush administration's posi- tion towards offering the clear prospect of aid to the Soviet Union beyond emergency humanitarian assistance this winter. In the aftermath of the failed coup, the US stressed it would not offer an \"open cheque- book\" to the Soviet Union and called for a credible economic reform plan coupled with cuts in defence spending and mili- tary aid to Cuba. Under pressure from allies, the US has begun to sound more positive. Mr Baker, who has generally taken a more flexible position on Soviet pol- icy, said last night the Soviets could expect US aid if they committed themselves to free. market reforms. Speaking to reporters, Mr Baker said: \"They don't have to take the steps first, but com- mit to take the steps.\" Mr Baker plans to meet a far broader range of Soviet offi- cials than usual, including key reformers such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin, KGB Chief Vadim Bakatin and Kaz- akhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. His remarks came as senior monetary officials in Washing- ton waited to open direct talks with Soviet reform economists. President George Bush is due to hold talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl next Monday in Washington, and will shortly meet President Francois Mitterrand of France. He has already met Mr John Major, the British prime minis- ter, who chairs the Group of Seven industrialised countries, the main forum for discussing aid to the Soviet Union.

   "text_content" : "By Barbara Durr in Chicago THE Soviet Union will have difficulty taking advantage of $315m (Â£186.3m) worth of US agricultural credit guarantees because western commercial banks consider the fast-dissolv- ing country to be an increas- ingly poor credit risk. anking officials are loath to finance Washington's offer to make the $315m available immediately, and question what legal entity in the Soviet Union is able to commit itself to the obligations involved in borrowing at this stage. \"Why would banks lend money in a situation where it seems very difficult for the ultimate borrower to repay, even with credit? It's not good sense,\" said Mr Michael Yavor- sky, in charge of export sales at Chase Manhattan. The US Department of Agri- Opposition demonstrators erect barricades in Tbilisi yesterday after rumours that Georgia's President Zviad Gamsakhurdia planned an attack against them THE upheavals in Moscow have bbighl ted the Impact on world commodity markets of the Soviet Union's economic decline over the paut two years. The question noW concerns the extent to which ncreased western aid, ad allowing food imports, will ease the coun- of try's appetite for hard currency and stem a he flood of metals exports which have been us undermining western markets. Id, Page80 culture's programme provides credit guarantees for 98 per cent of the principal and 4.5 per cent of the interest on the loans needed for Soviet pur- chases from US agricultural producers. A further $585m worth of credit guarantees have been promised by Wash- ington between next month and March. However, banks that have participated in the agricultural credits programme in the past say they might be willing to consider financing the Soviet sales again if there are \"addi- tional comforts\" in the deals. - . __ These would include guaran- teeing 100 per cent of the prin- cipal and a larger portion of the Interest. The credit risk involved in the limited cover on the inter- est, however, appears to be causing the main concern, according to officials at both US and European banks. The fixed guarantee on inter- est was not attractive because \"this is a floating-rate world,\" said Mr Paul McGonagle, chief of international risk manage- ment at First Chicago. European banks, which have participated more actively in the programme than their US counterparts, have also adopted a \"wait and see atti- tude,\" according to Ms Whak- yung Lee at Credit Agricole's New York office. A number of the bankers said they intended to discuss possible changes in the terms of the Department of Agricul- ture programme, which is run by the department's Commod- ity Credit Corporation. In the past the US has eased terms of foreign purchases of US agricultural goods. In the case of Mexico, for example, it provided guarantees for 100 per cent of the principal and tied the amount of covered interest to that of 52-week Treasury notes. Bankers acknowledged the political expediency of finding a way for the Soviet Union to buy the agricultural supplies it needs, but said the US govern- ment's presumption that the banks would step up to shoul- der the loan risk was naive. Some bankers suggested the Department of Agriculture might be obliged to offer direct credits, instead of credit guar- antees and thus accept the risk itself. The Soviets have succeeded in buying 100,000 metric tons of maize this week under the credit programme. But it is believed that this used a pre- coup financing commitment from a European bank.",

   "text_content" : "Ariane Genillard on the escalating claims to Nagorno-Karabakh R Elshad Gassanov, an Azerbaijani vil- lager, sits in his home under a family portrait showing his five-year-old son holding a machine-gun. \"Don't ask me how many members of my family have been killed. Ask me how many remain alive,\" he says. Thir- teen children in his village are fatherless. Normal life is now out of the question. With the roads too dangerous to travel, outsiders can only reach the village by helicopter. This is Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave within the republic of Azerbaijan which is mainly populated by ethnic Armenians. The terri- tory has suffered recurrent outbreaks of violence in the past three years as Azerbai- janis and Armenians vie for power. But sweeping changes in the Soviet Union are exacerbating rival claims on the area. Last weekend alone at least 13 people were killed, bringing the number of casualties this year to more than 150 and making it the bloodiest region in the Soviet Union for ethnic clashes. Two Armenian deaths, at the hands of unidentified assailants, were reported yes- terday by an independent Azer- baijani news agency. Such is the violence that Azerbaijanis say only the inter- vention of the Soviet army is preventing a slide into full-scale civil war. The Azerbaijani leadership is fearful that Moscow's support will ebb away. Soviet troops, as well as Soviet Interior Ministry forces, have been stationed in the area since a state of emer- gency was declared in January 1990. Together with Azerbaijani Interior Ministry forces, they claim to defend both communi- ties but in practice protect Azerbaijani villages from Armenian attack. In the small village of Mesh- all, Soviet soldiers almost out- number Azerbaijani inhabit- ants. Colonel Ion Dima, who comes from Moldova, explains how Armenians encamped in the surrounding hills fired 71 rockets last Friday night. But the colonel is quick to add that this conflict has noth- ing to do with him. After 17 years in the army he is now ready to join the National Guard in Moldova, which declared independence from the Soviet Union on August 27. Azerbaijan declared indepen- dence three days later, but the next day Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the republic's president, flew to Moscow to seek guarantees that Soviet forces stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the border with Armenia would not be withdrawn. Yet Mr Mutalibov shows no intention of trying to disarm combatants. Instead he has made it clear that Azerbaijan's military forces would replace Soviet troops as soon as a \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t i national guard was created in the republic. However, the new Soviet interior minister, Mr Viktor Barannikov, said yesterday i there were no plans for a rapid Spullout by his troops from eth- k nic flashpoints like Nagorno-Karabakh. He added he would present President Mikhail Gorbachev with pro- posals to set up special \"inter- r republican rapid-deployment r units\" to send to such areas. he Azerbaijani leader- ship's stance hardened . . after Nagorno-Kara- bakh, which has been an autonomous region since 1923, declared its independence on r September 2. 5 \"We have no intention of i negotiating with any indepen- t dent republic,\" Mr Mutalibov I said in an interview this week. \"Nagorno-Karabakh is insepa- > rable from Azerbaijan and all I citizens there must respect the i Azeri laws.\" Both the authorities in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, and in k Nagorno-Karabakh point out that previous negotiations k have failed. They cite as evi- ai dence the recent murder of Mr b Valery Gregorian, an Arme- cl nian from Nagorno-Karabakh U who headed a delegation to C open talks in Baku with Presi- dent Mutalibov. Mr. Gregorian a] was shot dead in the streets of tl Stepanakert, capital of the dis- DI puted region, but it is not ol known by whom. sl \"The situation there has ci reached a deadlock,\" said Mr b, Mutalibov. \"The place is under a the control of certain destruc- a tive elements who point on the n map to the area they are going to occupy next,\" he added, p referring to Armenians. 1H The armed Armenians in si Nagorno-Karabakh are referred r to as bandits. Most Azerbai- ti janis believe they are armed by d the CIA and Israel and are set te to reconquer the disputed ii region. c Armenians say, however, e that Azerbaijani forces, along ; with Soviet troops, are attempting to empty the area of Armenians, who make up 75 per cent of the population. Wit- nesses allowed to visit the Armenian side say locals have been forced by Azerbaijani i troops to desert whole villages, I which they then take over. In the enclave itself the z spirit of vengeance is so omni- I present it is hard to see how any peace agreement would I hold; for three years now local Azerbaijani and Armenian vil- \" lagers have been waging ter- rorist attacks against each t other. \"This land must be cleared \" of Armenians, or the conflict will never end,\" says one man in a typical outburst of anti-Ar- . menian anger. Next to him lies a bullet-ridden bus in which six of his fellow villagers died . in an Armenian attack. As he speaks, shooting can be heard in the surrounding hills.",

   "text_content" : "By Steatn Wagetyl in Tokyo JAPAN is softening its hard-line policy towards the Soviet Union in the wake of the failed coup, and playing down the importance of a terri- torial row which has long plagued bilateral relations. The shift in attitude could allow Tokyo to abandon its insistence on linking large- scale financial aid to the Soviet Union to a settlement of Japan's claim to the southern Kurile islands, seiaed by Soviet soldiers in 1945. Japan would still be reuc- tant to ofer massive financial assistance without dastic eco nomic reform in the Soviet Union.

But one senior official concedes that it \"would not be right\" to press territorial claims now. Hints of a shift in Tokyo's attitude came this week during meetings between Japanese ministers and Mr Ruslan Khas- bulatov, acting speaker of the Russian republic's parliament and a top aide to Mr Boris Yelt- sin, the Russian president. Mr Khasbuatov is the most senior Russian or Soviet official to visit Tokyo since President Mikhail Gorbachev came in sprins. Mr Toshiki Kaft, Japan's premier, and other Japanese acibbls havea, as before, asked far a resolutin of the territo- rial dispute. But they have avoMded preing hard for a set- tlement, as they did during Mr Gorbachev's trip. Japmn ae ak have also am -d a ej- elflatoy _ er- iiea YMur Y am ii vered by Mr Khasbulatov in which the Russian leader promised to \"accelerate\" talks with Tokyo. When Mr Gorbachev made sin- ilar vague pledges in April he was repeatedly urged to be more specific. A senior foreign ministry official said Japan was abiding by the policy it presented at the London summit of the Group of Seven, namely that Tokyo would respond favoura- bly to positive changes in the Soviet Union The foreign ministry has rea- son to be coy about softening its approach. It runs the risk of angering right-wing poltical groups in Japan which have long campaiged for the return of the Nortern Territories.

A second senior foreign ministry official said Japan's \"funda- mental position\" was that it wanted to help the Soviet Union. \"But we have some doubts whether finance would really help unless they recon- struct their economy.\" Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a for- mer ambassador and an adviser to Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics group, puts it more bluntly. \"There will be no change in Japanese policy [on aid] because the coup has not changed anything in the eco- pneale situation, only in the potc situation.

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd THE Soviet Union has conjured up a modern day equivalent of the alchemist stone which turns base metal to gold. It takes the form of hidden foreign assets of the now ille- gal Communist party, which are said to be so fabulous that they could, if found, save the Soviet economy. The newspaper Komsomol- skaya Pravda, once the organ of the party's youth-wing but now an independent and popu- lar daily, together with the weekly economic newspaper Commersant, have in the course of investigations into the party's secret funds vari- ously estimated that they stand at $12bn and $100bn (Â£59.5bn). Urgent investigations are under way. Mr Nikolai Kruchina, the party's business manager and the main controller of the party's fortune, committed sui- cide soon after the failure of the August 19 coup. Komso- molskaya Pravda says the USSR Prosecutor's Office found a file in Mr Kruchina's flat giving the name of indi- viduals who controlled access to the party's hidden business dealings - but which reveals little else. The rest of the evidence so far presented is vague. The newspaper quotes an unnamed source in Gosbank, the state bank, who says he saw documents describing four big financial transactions in which Rbs280bn were changed into $12bn and then put into foreign accounts. These deals took place in December last year and January, May and August of 1991, the source says. The most mouth-watering detail is provided by yet another unnamed official, this time from the Moscow Conven- tion of Businessmen, a private entrepreneurs' association. He told Commersant that party funds of up to $100bn were kept in some 7,000 bank accounts - mostly in small banks in French ports. Further caches were lodged in banks in Uruguay, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Cuba and Iran. Asked for evidence, the anonymous official proved less than convincing. He said Mr Ivan Frolov, the former editor of Pravda, had flown to Diis- seldorf immediately after the coup for medical treatment, but that after \"only an hour in a Diisseldorf clinic he then dis- appeared, probably to draw money from CPSU accounts\". No one doubts Communist party funds were substantial. However, the salaries of thou- sands of workers, and in recent years the subsidies paid to publications with sharply declining sales, had, according to party sources, cut deeply into the reserves, officially claimed by party officials earlier this year to be Rbs4bn.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels THE Netherlands, which holds the presidency of the EC, is likely to face strong opposition from some northern member states if it attempts to abandon the technical paper on eco- nomic and monetary union dis- cussed at Monday's meeting of Community finance ministers. The paper suggested that a group of economically strong member states could move ahead to the final phase of Emu ahead of their weaker counterparts, based on strict economic criteria. It was welcomed by the UK and Germany on Monday and yesterday morning Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said on BBC radio the plan rep- resented an acceptance of real- ity by other EC members. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to raise the question during talks in Paris today with French Presi- dent Francois Mitterrand. The British leader is also expected to discuss it with other EC states in the margins of tomorrow's Paris meeting of the European Democratic Union which is to be addressed by Mr Major. The issue of a two-speed Emu met sharp criticism from mainly southern EC states which felt that they would ini- tially be left out of the final phase. In the wake of this response, Mr Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister, said after Monday's meeting that he had not approved the paper and that it had \"no political status\". He also said he favoured a system of derogations for weaker economies, rather than a two-speed approach. Italy - a principal opponent of the original paper - would welcome any return to the idea of derogations. It would keep the group of 12 together in the final move to currency union and eliminate the risk of Italy being excluded from the first division of strong economies.",

Mr Hoffmeyer, who at 66 is the longest serving EC central bank governor, was elected by his EC counterparts. He is highly regarded by his peers as a straight talking pragmatist, with a dry sense of humour, who played an important part in solving the problems of high inflation and a persistent cur- rent account deficit that had bedevilled the Danish economy for many years. He takes over chairmanship of the EC central bankers' group when important deci- sions are looming in negotia- tions on European economic and monetary union. His ten- ure of office until the end of 1992 is expected to be marked by a continuity of policies from those of Mr Karl Otto Pdhl, his predecessor.

Here, he will have an important role to play in the discussions over the transitional second stage of Emu and over the treaty and structure of stage three, in which monetary union is due to be achieved.

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsy in London and Laura Siber in Belgrade BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA will press the European Community to send monitors to what is one of Yugoslavia's most potentially volatile republics, a senior Bosnian oficial said yesterday. EC monitors are already in the repub- lies of Croatia and Slovenia which declared independence from the Yugo- slav federation on June 25. Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, the dep- uty prime minister of Bosnia-Hercego- vina, said Serb paramilitary forces were now stepping up their attempts to carve a greater Serbia out of that republic. Any carve-up of Bosnia-Hercegovina would provoke ethnic conflict between the republic's three largest ethnic groups which have peacefully co-existed since the second world war. These groups consist of Moslems, which make up over 43 per cent of the 4.3m population, Serbs, (33 per cent) and Croats (17 per cent). Mr Mahmutcehadic said Serbs in the west of the republic, which borders with Croatia, already control large parts of the border areas. \"Croat forces are fighting Serb rebels from Krajina. However, Serb paramilitary forces from Bosnia-Hercegovina are attacking Croat forces in Croatia,\" explained Mr Mah- mutcehajic. He added that the Serbs in the Kraj- ina, a region in south-western Croatia, who earlier this year declared their autonomy from the republic, and Serbs in northern Bosnia-Hercegovina, have almost achieved their goal in forming a corridor which would link the Krajina with the republic of Serbia. \"We have asked monitors to come to Bosnia-Hercegovina. It is very, very important for us that they come,\" said Mr Mahmutcehajic. EC monitors will step up their work for ceasefire talks yesterday I- as the EC sponsored peace conference t, reconvenes tomorrow in The Hague. r The monitors, which will number more s than 300, have already spent the past e several days travelling around Slavo- a nia, eastern Croatia, a region which has a taken the brunt of attacks by Serb mili- tants and the Yugoslav federal army. o Belgrade radio yesterday reported y that \"15 Croats soldiers and four Ser- d bian territorial defence members were killed during overnight battles between k Croat security forces and Serbs in Kusinje, a village two miles outside of Pakrac. Croat security forces remain in control of Pakrac, a town 70 miles east of the Croatian capital Zagreb.\" Five out of 79 EC observers in Yugo- slavia were earlier in the week deployed to Osijek, the capital of eastern Slavo- nia, where they will rotate teams through the war-torn region. Mr Jan Ruysink, chief of operations for EC observers, said yesterday: \"The team plans to meet with as many local representatives as possible in order to create a masterplan of local agreement to extend monitors to those areas at war.\" Meanwhile, Serbian security forces yesterday broke up a demonstration of several thousand ethnic Albanians in Pristina, the capital of the southern province of Kosovo, who were protest- ing against Serbian policy in Kosovo. Serbian government measures this year will prevent an estimated 350,000 Alba- nian pupils and students from attend- ing school.",

   "text_content" : "LANS by the ruling Social Democrats to increase state sharehold- ings in industry have emerged as the main issue in Sweden's general election campaign, which ends with voting next Sunday. What has provoked the debate is a government's proposal to expand the role of the compulsory ATP national pension funds in the capital markets. The funds would be merged with the trade union-affiliated wage-earner funds to create five huge funds with a total of SKr500bn (Â£46.7bn) in capital assets. Half of this capital could be used for investment in equities, five times the size of the share portfolio now held by the ATP and the wage- earner funds combined. John Burton looks at what is shaping up as the main election issue The five new funds together would be allowed to acquire a quarter of the voting rights in any industrial company, with the trade unions holding half of that stake. The government says the proposal will guarantee the future of the country's pension scheme by widening the funds investment opportunities. The opposition calls the plan a case of creeping socialism. The ATP funds are now allowed to invest SKr25m on the bourse, while the wage- earner funds, which were financed until this year by a corporate profit tax, has another SKr20m in equities. They are among the biggest shareholders in companies such as Volvo, the car maker, and Astra pharmaceuticals. Abolition of wage-earner funds will be among the first actions the non-socialists take if they gain power, which the opinion polls suggest will hap- pen. In contrast to the Social Democratic policy of selling minority stakes in state compa- nies while retaining majority government control, the non- socialists favour full-scale pri- vatisation, albeit over a lengthy period. The goal is to sell assets val- ued at SKrlObn per year through general share issues a on the Stockholm bourse. An I amount greater would swamp . the market, where total new ;t share issues averaged around i SKrlObn a year during the r, 1980s. Early candidates for privati- Ã½r sation would be the state com- it panies already listed on the ,e bourse, including pharmaceuti- ie cal and food group Procordia - and the steel concern SSAB. These would be followed by i Nordbanken, the Swedish state Ig share in Scandinavian Airlines a- System and the mining, for- y estry and defence companies - owned by Fortia. Utilities slated for privatisa- a tion include Televerket, the telecommunications agency, 1- and Vattenfall, the hydroelec- ir tric power group. bs It would take 25 years to complete the privatisation pro- gramme under the non-social- ist proposal since the state companies and utilities have a total value of SKr250bn. But the non-socialists are also con- sidering selling some of these concerns directly to other com- panies in order to accelerate the process. Foreigners would probably be allowed to participate in some share offerings and cor- porate acquisitions, although it is still unclear how the non-so- cialists would change rules governing foreign ownership. Foreigners are not allowed to own natural resources, such as mines and forests and may also be prevented from acquiring defence companies for national security reasons. Reshaping the model, Page 18",

   "text_content" : "By David Goodhart in Bonn JUNE industrial orders for east Germany rose by 10 per cent over the previous month giving further grounds for cautious optimism for the economy. However much of the increase came from promised Soviet orders which increased foreign orders by 63 per cent. Domestic orders in fact fell by 4.5 per cent and the overall order level remained about 25 per cent down on the average of the last six months of 1990. The main sectors to benefit from foreign interest were heavy machinery, steel, rail- way wagons and textiles. EC 'cooling off' for time-shares Mr Karel van Miert, EC com- missioner for consumer affairs, is planning to introduce Com- munity legislation which would allow buyers of time- share properties a \"cooling-off\" period during which they could change their minds about a deal, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. The Commission may pro- duce a draft directive aimed at protecting time-share custom- ers before the end of the year. Certain time-share operators are notorious for offering potential buyers \"prizes\" if they sit through presentations about holiday developments. The free gifts often prove to be illusory or are attached to unreasonable conditions. Editorial comment, Page 18 Poland 'must stay with austerity' Poland must stick to tight monetary policies despite a recession which could last another 18 months, Mr Marek Dabrowski, central bank gover- nor-designate, said yesterday, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. Mr Dabrowski told parlia- ment's budget committee that \"an expansion of money supply now would lead to catastrophic hyper-inflation\". But he admit- ted that a continuing recession carried \"an enormous threat of an unco-ordinated outbreak of social discontent\".

   "text_content" : "By Nancy Dune in Washington I CONGRESSMAN Richard Gephardt, US Home majorit leader, yesterday urged r- dent Bush to move quickly to take the lead among western nations to create a Soviet aid programme linked to economic reforms for which the US would provide $8bn a year over the next four-five years. In a speech to the Institute for International Economics in Washington, Mr Gephardt urged passage of aggressive new trade legislation. He pro- posed a \"new Gephardt Amendment\", to force US trade partners to live up to trade pacts, urging the filing of an Article XXIII case against Japan under Gatt, claiming \"general nullification and impairment of our rights\". Another proposed provision would provide incentives for US companies setting up in Mexico to enforce labour and environmental standards, a d proposal modelled on the \"Sol- - ltvan principles\" developed for South Asia. The p3bn Soviet to aid could be taken from the US r defence budget Besides grant- id lng the Soviet Union Most ie Favoured Nation status, the US US should help set up a stabl- mr lisation fund to back rouble convertibility, provide guaran- te tees for investors in eastern in Europe, boost credits for sale dt of western grain, and send ye advisers to help the Soviets ro- create a modern financial sys- 'dt tem. US The administration, even to after the failed Moscow coup, ng persisted in \"mumbling politi- Lse cal cliehs about 'not writing tt, cheques'. They are more com- on sortable defending an outdated \". 8300bn defence establishment on than in helping the Soviets ror move decisively to economic in reform.\" nd His proposal would \"put a teeth\" in \"Super 301\", a provi- sion in the 1988 trade bill, s] much feared by US trading partners, which has lapsed. It ca would force nations to open I their markets to both US and h foreign exports. Mostly, the 6t proviion- seems targeted a against Japan, which \"contin- h ued... to practise adversarial b capitalism\". The legislation' a would reduce the president's ti discretion to impose sanctions. h If he failed to retaliate, the ih president would have to give ri Congress an action plan \"that u includes clear, measurable a milestones for success\". Con- ft gress would have to approve C these milestones, and retalia- n tory action have to follow, if a they were not met. Mr ti Gephardt lost much of his n labour and farmer support this a year by falling to oppose the h administration's proposed free n trade accord with Canada and a Mexico. He proposed legisla- te tion he claimed would \"help n shape a good agreement\". US companies which relo- cated operations in Mexico would he rged to abide by high labour and environmen- tal tandards; fallre to do so would open them to stock- holder suits for potential lia- bility. Companies which loved to Mexico to get access to the US market would also have to abide by the high labour and environmental rules or become actionable under US trade law. * US-Chinese relations sus- fered another jolt when the US Customs Service last week raided the 23 American-based offices of Chinese government trading companies, seizing money and millions of dollars' worth of goods suspected of having illegally entered the US market.

   "text_content" : "AT a buffet next week I promising a fine selection of Danish pork dishes, Japanese officials will be expected to chew over a promise by Mr I Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's prime I minister, to end a pork import i fraud allegedly involving Tai I wanese pigs and Japanese i gangsters, Robert Thomson i reports from Tokyo. Since Mr Kaifu gave this 1 pledge three months ago, Japan's Taiwanese pork I imports have kept rising, Euro- pean exports have kept falling, Tokyo is again arguing no pork 1 problem exists, and the EC is I squealing over lost share of the market. Japanese officials have even hinted that while Mr I Kaifu is free to make promises, I the government does not nec- I essarily have to keep them. I This lack of action has prompted the EC to co-host a . seminar with the Danish pork i industry next Tuesday, and 1 offer the Japanese guests a i menu of politically-flavoured ( pork loin. The EC delivered a Note in April complaining some Tai- wanese pork is sold at unfairly low prices in Japan because of invoice falsification, and ask- ing Tokyo to \"suppress fraudu- lent pork importsW Falsified invoices are used to take advantage of a \"differential duty\" system designed to pro-. tect Japanese farmers by charging extra duty on imports priced at below a minimum of Y612 (Â£2.67) per kg. By marking invoices at Y612, the EC say, some Japanese importers slice off a profit on pork bought for, say, Y400 from Taiwanese suppliers; distribu- tors and retailers also benefit. It is not suggested all Japanese traders are involved, but the EC has made a list of suspect companies, and is awaiting Japanese police action. \"It's easy to see something's wrong. The minimum import price is supposed to be Y612, but you can buy pork for Y450 in Japa- f 1 1 e t J 1 I- Kaifut pledge to act i nese stores. If the import price was true, they would be losing Y200 on every kilo sold,\" a a Danish official said. e In the first half of this year, t pork imports from Taiwan rose { 28.1 per cent; those from Den- i mark fell 13.4 per cent. By end- July, Taiwan had a 51 per cent B share of the $1.5bn (2880a) 1 market against Denmark's -2 per cent. The Danish industry had already recorded a 22 per cent fall in exports last year, and lost its pace as market leader. The issue is compli- cated by the role in meat imports played by a Japanese underclass known as the bur- akumin, traditional slaughter. ers of livestock, discriminated against and feared. Japnese gangsters are also thought to have won .a.prime 6u tf the illegal market by using short-lived front companies and passing themselves off as burakumin, whom police can be reluctant to prosecute. Japan's Ministry of e ture insists the ECs r- g ating the impact of the rau. a lent imports, and that Taiwan's proximity and its r, strength in chilled pork are e important reasons for the growing share. But the EC says I- chilled pork sales have hardly Sfluctuated, and Commission ifbcials are planning a tougher 2 approach, if the pork buffet y does not work.",

Yesterday, ICL said that in a break with its accepted busi- ness practice, it intended to market in Poland and Czecho- slovakia mainframe computers built by its Japanese parent, as well as its own Series 39 machines. It claims to lead in supplying imported computer systems in the two countries. Mr Peter Slavid, ICL's corpo- rate systems business man- ager, said the decision to sell Fujitsu mainframes was a local response to eastern European market conditions and would 1 not be repeated elsewhere. Fujitsu has stressed ICL should be seen as a member of a loose confederation of Fujitsu sub- sidiaries, free to compete with its parent in world markets. ICL has decided to sell Fujitsu mainframes in Poland and Czechoslovakia since the Japanese machines are closer in design to the \"Ryad\" main- frames formerly built in east- ern Europe than ICL's Series 39 computers. It will be easier for Polish and Czechoslovakian computer users to move from their obsolete Ryad main- frames to Fujitsu's M-series mainframes than to Series 39. The Ryad range was intro- duced by the Soviet Union and its east European allies in 1972, based on the design of IBM's mainframe computers. They have become the de facto stan- dard in the former Soviet bloc but after local makers closed, they will have to be replaced by western systems. The Ryad design is no longer adequate for the growing infor- mation needs of countries like Poland, Hungary and Czecho- slovakia as they try to revital- ise their economies. Eastern Europe probably has about 1,200 Ryad machines ready for replacement by modern west- ern computers. IBM can capi- talise on this need, with a stock of machines available through its leasing subsidiary.",

Mr Rene Garcia, CVM direc- tor, said on Monday two SAo Paulo broking firms and eight individuals were involved. The CVM accused the traders of having advance information on large purchases in the market, which led them to speculate on their own account. \"We are taking this case to the end, to show to the world that insider trading is not acceptable in Brazil,\" said Mr Garcia. Telebras has become a favourite share among foreign investors lately. Over the past five months, the share price has almost quadrupled in dol- lar terms. As a result, the com- pany has moved from 13th to third place in market capitalis- ation rankings, and is now val- ued at about $1.7bn (Â£lbn).

His call to Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, follows a Chilean judge's finding that Mr Moyle was murdered and did not commit suicide as the Chilean authorities originally ruled. Mr Mote, the editor of Defence Helcopter World and a former AS pilot, was found hanging from a sheet in the clothes cupboard of his Sant- iago hotel in March last year. He was attending the FIDAE air show, the biggest exhibi- tion of military hardware in Latin America. Chilean homicide police said he had committed suicide. However, his death gave rise to press reports that he was murdered because of informa- tion he had obtained on sales of military technology to Iraq. Mr Tony Moyle, his father, believes this to be the case. Judge Alejandro Solls's ver- dict closes an 18-month inquiry dogged by a lack of co-operation from both British and Chilean authorities. The inquiry failed to shed any light on who killed Mr Moyle or why. Mr Soils said he decided to close the case tem- porarily in the absence of fur- ther evidence.",

The programme, launched in December 1988, has become the president's most visible domes-i tic policy. As Mexico's econ- omy has grown and public finances strengthened, spend- ing on the programme has risen to $1.7bn (Â£lbn) this year, a 60 per cent rise on 1990.

   "text_content" : "I By George Graham in Washington JUDGE Clarence Thomas yesterday faced a barrage of tough questioning from sena- tors on the first day of hear- ings on his nomination to the US Supreme Court. The eight Democratic mem- bers on the Senate judiciary committee served notice that they planned to question Mr Thomas closely on his views on abortion, civil rights and the constitutional role of the Supreme Court. They warned him that they would not be satisfied with the evasive responses they had received from the last two Supreme Court nominees. \"Many of us are concerned about the direction the court has taken in recent years. It has increasingly abandoned its role as the guardian of the powerless. It has repeatedly sought to turn back the clock on civil rights,\" complained Senator Edward Kennedy. \"Many fear that we are wit- nessing the creation of a mono- lithic right-wing court that is going to favour the state and the power of the state over the rights of the individual,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy. Senator Joseph Biden, the committee's chairman, ques- tioned Mr Thomas closely on his controversial writings about the application of \"natu- ral law\" to the Constitution, but Mr Thomas responded that he had been speaking of politi- cal theory rather than juridi- cial interpretation. The committee's Republican minority came to Judge Thomas's aid with glowing praise for his ascent from pov- erty. \"I'm so doggone proud of eay: \"concernea\" you I can hardly stand it,\" said Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who said he could understand Mr Thomas's childhood experi- ence because he, too, had grown upin a home \"without indoor facilities\". But even Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, warned that he was concerned about Judge Thomas's apparently low opin- ion of Congress. \"I believe that deference is due to the president's nomina- tion, but that could change if the trend continues to turn the court into a super-legislature,\" he said. Judge Thomas, whose nomi- nation has divided political interest groups, is expected to face three days of questioning from the 14-man committee. A New York Times/CBS opinion poll yesterday showed that 65 per cent of those ques- tioned had no opinion on the nomination. Of those who had formed an opinion, twice as many favoured Mr Thomas as opposed him.

   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagutyl in Tokyo THE Japanese ministry of finance yesterday unveiled a package of reforms aimed at stamping out stock market abuses revealed in recent financial scandals. The proposals, which are likely to be passed into law in the next few weeks, were accompanied by the publica- tion of a tough new code of conduct from the Japan Securi- ties Dealers' Association. They are also likely to be followed in the next few days by the publication of detailed plans for the overhaul of the supervision of securities and banking. A finance ministry official said that, taken together, the planned legal changes and the securities dealers' association's code were an important reform of the securities markets. But critics said the measures would not go far enough. \"It's a pretty mild reform in the light of the furore caused by these scandals,\" said Mr Robert Zie- linski, an analyst at Jardine Fleming, the stockbroker. The ministry's draft bill con- tains a legal ban on stockbro- kers compensating clients for trading losses. Both the broker and the client will face fines and possible prison sentences if they knowingly paid or received compensation, or if they made an agreement guar- anteeing such payments. Foreign brokers, however, pointed out that the ministry's proposed penalties were very small - a maximum fine of Ylm (Â£4,300) for brokers paying compensation and Y500,000 for an investor receiving. Admittedly, guilty individu- als would face fines and up to one year and six months imprisonment, respectively, but they said such sentences would be very rare since it would be difficult to prove a particular individual had paid or received compensation. The fines would be paid by their employers. The ministry's Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, risking his political future, appealed to parliament yes- terday to back his plans to overhaul the cash-driven electoral system, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Kaifu's package con- sists of two bXls to reform the election law and political funds law and a third calling for controls on parties. draft bill also proposes a ban on brokers managing discre- tionary funds on behalf of cli- ents. Compensation payments made for losses suffered on such discretionary accounts are one of the main elements of the financial scandals, which also involve links between bro- kers and criminal groups and illegal loans made by banks. The securities dealers' asso- clation's code sets out guide- lines for defining what, apart from cash payments, consti- tutes compensation. The rules define acceptable price ranges for dealing in unlisted securi- ties, to prevent brokers selling such securities at artificially low prices. They also set limits on the allocation of new securi- ties to particular custom- ers - another possible means of compensation. Brokers said the associa- tion's code closed the loopholes exploited in the recent scan- dals but left open others. Meanwhile, a special panel reporting to Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister, is in the final stage of preparing plans for the reform of the supervi- sion of the financial markets. The ad hoc commission on administrative reform is due to report to Mr Kalfu on Friday. A draft version proposes the establishment of a new watch- dog independent of the finance ministry. It would take over from the ministry the inspec- tion of banking and securities.",

   "text_content" : "MR DOUGLAS HURD, the British foreign secretary, arrives in Kenya, today for a two-day visit to Britain's most favoured former colony and the second largest recipient of British aid in sub-Saharan Africa, writes Julian Ozanne in Nairobi. He will find a nation gripped by politically explosive newspaper head- lines, most recently devoted to Presi- dent Daniel arap Moi attacking multi-party advocates as \"anarchists\" and accusing them of a plot to give marijuana to youths to incite them to demonstrate. He will be told about growing fears among Kenya's international donors ish about the concentration of wealth in ya, the hands of politically connected n's businessmen and mounting govern- the ment corruption. aid And, if Mr Hurd meets the govern- lan ment's critics, he will find deep dis- content with Britain's failure to by implement a policy, first announced ad- by the foreign secretary himself: link- esi- ing British aid to democratisation, Ing clean government and respect for its\" human rights and the rule of law. ive Since the birth last year of the pro- t to democracy movement, a collection of former politicians, lawyers and ars clergymen, things have never been ors quite the same in Kenya - a country which for years was praised as a peaceful, pro-western bedrock of sta- bility in an otherwise turbulent region. At least 20 people were shot dead in three days of riots last July, after the government detained a num- ber of pro-democracy advocates. Since then the government has been under constant pressure to implement the kind of democratic political changes happening in other parts of Africa. Mr Mol, however, has nailed his col- ours firmly to the mast of the one- party state. The president argues that multi-party politics would degenerate into tribalism. The government's critics say this is a an excuse for perpetuating rule by an L- undemocratic dlite. They say that t Britain's quiet diplomacy has failed t and they want Mr Hurd to cut back r, British aid, worth Â£42m last year. L- It is unlikely Mr Hurd will respond e to these demands and most British r officials believe that the opposition e goes too far. More worrying, perhaps, a to the British government are the growing claims of corruption and the I- apparent concentration of wealth in > the handi of senior government offi- t cdals. Mr Nicholas Biwott, the minis- e ter of energy, was accused recently at a public inquiry of allegedly asking s an Italian company for a Â£1.7m bribe. Trade with Kenya amounted to Â£380m last year and there is at least Â£lbn of UK investment. Concerns are also growing about the scale of takeovers of large local and foreign private companies by Asian businessmen believed to be act- ing as front men for senior govern- ment figures. Mr Hurd will not go into detail about these matters. He is more likely to encourage the government to move towards a more open political and economic system, reassure them of continued British goodwill while reminding them that the world has moved on and that nations which stand still do so at their own peril.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox GOVERNORS of the International Atomic Energy Agency, meeting today in Vienna, are expected to recom- mend more intrusive inspec- tion of countries which have signed the Nuclear Non-Prolif- eration Treaty to help detec- tion of illicit nuclear weapons programmes. The move is prompted by the IAEA's discovery since the end of the Gulf war that Iraq had breached NPT agreements on a \"massive\" scale. A signatory of the NPT, Iraq had agreed not to develop nuclear weapons and to allow IAEA inspection of nuclear facilities. The IAEA's success in detecting embryonic nuclear weapons programmes in secre- tive countries will be under particular scrutiny as the gov- ernors are also expected to approve a safeguards inspec- tion agreement negotiated with Communist North Korea after five years of \"painful diplo- matic ballet\". The most important discov- ery of the IAEA team headed by Mr David Kay is that Iraq was pursuing three parallel ways of enriching uranium, the essential and most difficult step in making nuclear bombs. Fissile uranium makes up less than 1 per cent of natural ura- nium and bombs need that concentrated to around 90 per cent. While the most developed of the Iraqi enrichment methods, electromagnetic separation, looks primitive by present western standards, it is essen- tially that used by the US in the 1940s to make the Hiro- shima bomb and \"it's wrong to dismiss it - it worked back then,\" said Mr Kay. Enrichment by centrifuges, a method Iraq had nearly made operational before the war, is of western sophistication. The IAEA concluded that within 18 months Baghdad could have produced up to 30kg of enriched uranium, enough for a weapon.",

Late last night, the upper house met to con- sider a proposal that would allow about five senators currently opposed to the treaty to cast a yes vote conditional on the pact being approved by a popular vote. Twelve of the 23 senators are known to be against the pact, which needs 16 votes to pass. Mrs Aqulno's attempt to ! ' i rally in sup- port of the treaty, which requires acceptance by Monday when US leases expire, attracted less than 50,000 people instead of the 500,000 expec- ted, an indication of the wane in people power, the force that helped topple the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos 5%' years ago. In an echo of Mr Marcos's politics of manipulation, most of the people at the demonstration arrived by bus and had their meals provided. Underlining the groundswell of nationalism, demonstrators opposed to the bases thronged the streets outside the senate building last night. The demonstration appeared far more spontaneous and was at least as large as the government-financed rally. Gen Lisandro Abadia, head of the armed forces, accused senators rejecting the bases treaty of taking the line of the country's ban- ned Communist party. But he denied there was substance to ramours that the military might launch a coup to reinstate the Americans. Pres- ident George Bush has reiterated that there would be no new concessions to entice an elev- enth hour ratification by the Philippine senate. After 15 months of negotiations, in which the US made significant concessions, Washington is disinclined to talk further, diplomats say.",

Mr Bond said he believed the guarantee would not be enforced because of an assurance from the then-chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Mr William Purves. Mr Bond is challenging bank action to wind up his private company, Dallhold Investments. The case could ultimately result in bank- ruptcy for the former chairman of the Bond Corporation. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, Bank of New Zealand and Tricontinental Corporation are seeking to enforce a $194m guarantee given by Mr Bond in 1990 on a $340m loan to fund the Greenvale nickel project in Queensland. US group condemns Kuwait A US-based human rights group has condemned the killings, torture and deportation of suspected collaborators in Kuwait since the country was liberated in February and accused the US administration of a \"disturbing unwillingness\" to protest. Middle East Watch, in a report out today, said most of abuses were committed by the security forces or by irregular armed groups working closely with them. The State Security Secret Police are singled out as the worst offenders, Victor Mallet writes. The group claimed \"the highest levels\" of government shared complic- ity in the killings because none of those responsible have been arrested and because government members have called for Kuwait to be cleared of a supposed fifth column. US to recompense Israel on loans The Bush administration promised Congress yesterday it would bear any additional costs to Israel resulting from a four-month delay in approving $10bn in loan guarantees for building housing for Soviet immigrants, Renter reports from Washington. The promise was among commitments made by the administration as it sought to avoid a row in Congress over President George Bush's request to delay the government loan guarantees to Israel.

Mr Stafford Taylor, Cellnet's managing director, claimed that the company had won a \"very significant victory\", because it had successfully defended itself against a more serious charge of subsidising one business from another.

The warning was issued by Sir Gordon Borrie, director- general of fair trading, at a Confederation of British Indus- try conference in London on European Community and UK competition law and policy. Sir Gordon said that the new vol- untary pre-notification proce- dure for UK clearance of straightforward mergers had been welcomed by business. The procedure had been used in about 20 per cent of cases, ay and most had been cleared ay within the initial 20-day period to for consideration. dr But publicity had been given in to the extensions required by to the OFT where there were con- Les cerns about the competition effects of a merger. by These extensions were used >r- \"when advisers should know a the case may be referred to the is- Monopolies and Mergers Comn- on mission - several pre-notified IK cases having gone to the ir MMC\", Sir Gordon said.

   "text_content" : "Emma Tucker reports on the rising tide of mortgage arrears IGNALS that the economy may be on the upturn are unlikely to come as any comfort to the thou- sands of mortgage payers facing repossession of their properties. Many arrears have reached a level payers are unable to cope with, even after the recent cuts in interest rates. Lenders and advisers warn that repossession rates are likely to rise, even above the current record levels. Recent figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) put the number of repossessions at 36,610 in the first half of the year. Halifax, Britain's largest building society, is expected to put aside more than Â£54m in provisions on residential mortgage lending in its results this week. The CML said that 162,210 loans were in arrears by between six months and 12 months at the end of June, suggesting thousands more homes could join the already high number of repossessed dwellings. A glut of empty repossessed houses will further depress an already sluggish housing market and see yet more fam- ilies. made homeless, often at the expense of local authorities who have to house them. For a government that champions home ownership the difficulties facing many mortgage payers could prove embarrassing, especially if predictions of worsening rates of possession prove correct. The CML has proposed that the government provide a Â£100m sub- sidy to the Housing Corporation, which provides housing associations with finance. The associations would be able to bid for a share of the money to buy homes from owner occupiers in default who would be entitled to be rehoused by local authorities. Mr Clive Soley, Labour's spokes- man on housing, has called for a mortgage rescue scheme with a part-rent/part-buy element for those still able to pay some, if not all, of their mortgage. For those unable to meet any of their mortgage commitments he has suggested allowing local authorities or housing associations to take over the property and transfer it to the rented sector. This would require some element of subsidy, but Mr Soley argues that the CML's Â£100m estimate is conservative and that any element of subsidy would be less expensive than rehous- ing families in temporary accommoda- tion. The disadvantage to both schemes is that the government is unlikely to make any subsidies available for fear of being seen to be bailing out mort- gage defaulters.",

   "text_content" : "AEMA A-WWF V W^ By David Churchill THE HOTEL industry is unlikely to recover from the effects of the Gulf war and recession until 1993 at the ear- lest, according to a survey -published yesterday. Hotel consultants Horwath Consulting, part of the Stoy- Hayward accountancy group, say that the severity of the recession in the US and other countries meant that rapid recovery after the Gulf war \"could never seriously have been expected\". Mr Jonathan Bodlender, Horwath chairman, said: \"We have to face a scenario where only a modest upturn in busl- ness can be anticipated during the rest of this year.\" He predicted that hotel bankruptcies in the UK would continue this year, and that it would be \"the end of 1992, and perhaps even 1993, before there is a full recovery\". Mr Bodlender said the key determinant of an upturn in the hotel industry would be the extent of the US economic recovery and the dollar's strength in comparison with sterling next January, the prime booking period. Almost 30 per cent fewer Americans came to the UK in the first six months of this year compared with the first half of 1990. The Horwath report says room occupancy last year was 65.5 per cent compared with 68.1 per cent in 1989. London occupancy rates fell from 76.2 per cert to 75.0 per cenit.

   "text_content" : "By Als.on Smith AN INDEPENDENT central bank and rapid progress towards European economic and monetary union are at the heart of the wide-ranging eco- nomic policy approved by the conference yesterday. The party's aim is to limit the ability of the government to intervene in macroeconomic policy and in the market for political ends. Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman, told delegates that \"economic liberalism is not safe in the hands of illiberal politicians\". Where markets worked, government should simply set a framework of law and tax, where they did not, government should remove obstacles, and macroeconomic policy should be geared towards promoting stability. But the policy paper's new commitment to the regionalisa- tion of public-sector pay caused dismay among some representatives, and sparked an attempt by Scottish Liberal Democrats to scrap it, against the wishes of the leadership. Though the move was defeated, it marked the closest call the leadership is likely to face this week. Mr Martin Ford, the party's prospective candidate in Aberdeen North, said that the party had long argued for equal work for equal pay, and regionallsation of pay would be \"completely incompatible with a commit- ment to social justice\". He reflected the views expressed by a number of speakers in warning that pub- lic-sector pay was important to the economies of depressed areas: adopting the policy would be \"exacerbating inequality\". Mr Beith said that the policy paper, which includes plans for a strengthened and combined Office of Fair Trading and Monopolies and Mergers Com- mission, independent of minis- ters, offered an \"unashamedly free-market policy\". Among the most radical poli- cies, which have been attri- buted variously to the influ- ence of the former Social Democratic Party and to the Liberal party's economic roots, are the breaking up of BT, allowing private sector ser- vices to run on the British Rail network, and challenging the monopoly of the clearing banks in the business sector. Mr David Howarth, the pro- spective parliamentary candi- 'th, date for Cambridge and chair- mg man of the working- party for which produced the paper, said ion the de-centralisation of public ely sector pay was a consequence Ait- of the party's commitment to devolution. ws Not giving a Scottish parlia- of ment power over public sector ab- pay in Scotland would mean it :to was in the same position as ied county councillors in England, Icy having to pay public sector sal- ng ary increases over which they had no control, he added. Icy A move by Liberal Democrat for trade unionists, to reintroduce led commitment to a national eco- nd nomic assessment on the basis im- of consultations between gov- ds- ermnent, unions and employ- ily ers, was also defeated. The leadership said it was about Ull- trying to restore national pay tri- bargaining, which was not a lu- practicable option. ial Presenting the paper, Mr the Beith said there was no ratio- fts, nale in the Tories' aim of a IT, balanced budget over the eco- er- nomic cycle. He claimed that if ail in 1988 Mr Nigel Lawson, the he then chancellor, had been fol- ks lowing a savings target he would have seen that the Â£6bn ro- tax cuts' in the budget were di- too much at the wrong time. / I kmiwN Alan Beith: told conference that econom was \"not safe in the hands of illiberal p c liberalism n&\"-n&---to",

   "text_content" : "THERE have been times this week when the Liberal Demo- crats have IM' exuded the air of a bunch of late holidaymak- ers who cannot quite believe the good fortune that has kept a September sun blazing over Bournemouth's beaches. At others, it has been hard for a dispassionate observer to remember that there is more to Britain's third political force than a man called Mr Paddy Ashdown and 3,500 earnest local councillors. But if the innocent exuber- ance of the party activists who have forsaken the beach for the conference rostrum had a habit still of running far ahead of reality, it would be churlish to deny them a more modest celebration. When they gathered in Brighton two years ago in the aftermath of the break-up of the Liberal/SDP Alliance, the party was a shambles. It was divided even about its name. It was constantly overshadowed by the rancour of Dr David Owen. Its sup- port in the opinion polls stood at 5 per cent, trailing even the eccen- tric Greens. Mr Ashdown was a leader who had yet to learn chat in politics, energy must be fused with finesse. It does not look like that in Bournemouth. The polls put Liberal Democrat support at 15 per cent; they suggest also there may be another 4 or 5 per cent to play for in the election campaign. If that campaign is delayed until the spring, Mr Ashdown will have the opportunity to add a by-election victory at Kincardine and Deeside to those in Eastbourne and Ribble Valley. All the signs are that the Liberal Democrats will overturn the 2,000 majority which the late Mr Alick Buchanan-Smith delivered to the Conservatives in 1987. In personal terms, Mr Ash- down can reflect that polished performances during the Gulf war and the Soviet coup have lifted Mi& pubic-proflf and- popuart The \"you get what you see\" factor which helps explain Mr Major's place atop the ratings is equally relevant to Mr Ashdown's lead over the The woolly hats of Liberalism have been discarded in favour of earnest discussion of electoral reform, education, Europe, the economy and the environment badly-trailing Mr Neil Kinnock. There are signs, too, that policies are beginning to find their place in a party so long dominated by a combustible combination of high-minded idealism and factional in-fight- ing. The responsibilities of office that come with winning council seats have turned the conference into an altogether more sober affair. The woolly hats of Liberal- ism have been discarded in favour of earnest discussion of Mr Ashdown's litany of Es - electoral reform, education, Europe, the economy and the environment. The policies still sometimes reveal themselves as the product of a gleam in Mr Ashdown's eye rather than careful analysis of the possible. Nor are all in the party happy with its leader's decision to position much of its economic policy somewhat to the right of Mr Major's. But there is probably enough coherence in plans for a radical shake-up of competition policy, for an independent central bank or for an injection of an extra Â£2bn into edu- cation to sur- vive the casual analysis of the floating voter. As one senior party figure admitted with a candour +h.+ 4aoaawir\"- that deserves precise repetition: \"It is not the detail that counts. We have to persuade people that we have policies. That means they must be distinctive. Beyond that it hardly matters what they actu- ally are.\" For all Mr Ashdown's care- fully-scripted disclaimers, he is acutely conscious that at this election his party's fortunes will depend on how the vote splits between the Conserva- tives and Labour. An outright victory for Mr Kinnock would puncture the third-party bandwagon. But the impact on Labour of a fourth defeat or the uncertain- ties of a hung parliament just might open the door to the per- manent realignment of politics on which Mr Ashdown has staked his future. What he might justly claim in Bournemouth s that if the -chips do fall thefright way, the Liberal Democrats should be credible enough.to seize the opportunity."

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy THE ITV companies have decided to leave all options open on the setting up of a central scheduler to run the future Channel 3 network until after the new broadcasting licences are awarded. They believe it would be wrong to foreclose on any options before the future shape of ITV is known next month. A number of ITV companies including Thames, Granada and London Weekend Televi- sion have been outbid in the tenders, and some could lose their franchises. The Independent Television Commission, which will award the new licences, has also decided that the Channel 3 national programme schedule should be put together by a central scheduler who might have more than Â£400m a year at his or her disposal to com- mission programmes. An ITV committee has been working all year to draw up ground rules for such a power- ful figure. The rules would be ratified once the new licence holders were in place. D The main issues have ; involved the scheduler's level I of autonomy, the size of the a commissioning structure, 1 whether independent produc- I ers should have direct access or go through a sponsoring ITV company and how to Sorganise the split between the a holders of the London weekday t and weekend licences. The ITV companies have i decided to leave a wide range i of options open on all the issues until the new ITV or Channel 3 council members a can meet - probably in early November.

   "text_content" : "By David Owen THE MAIN opposition parties have followed the Conserva- tives in seeking advice from US political and communlca- tions consultants In the run-up to the general election. All three leading political parties have established con- tacts with transatlantic com- panies offering advice on how to win votes. Labour's contact with the US companies is Mr Philip Gould, of the party's Shadow Communications Agency (SCA) - the body which organises its specialist market- ing, polling, advertising and public relations programmes. Those in touch with Mr Gould have included: * Mellman & Lazarus, a Washington-based political strategy group, which has worked for many international figares including Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. * Sally Hunter Productions, a New York-based outfit which advised the film maker Hugh Hudson on his striking 1987 party political broadcast for Labour. * Napolitan & Associates, a New York political strategist which has worked for certain \"well-respected large trade unions in Britain\". * Doak Shrum Associates, one of the most experienced consultants working for the US Democratic party. These contacts have been made in spite of an ambivalent attitude within the party towards accepting US advice directly. Mr Colin Byrne, the party's chief press officer, said: \"Labour has never consulted American consultants. It is right that Philip [Gould] should acquaint himself with what is happening in America because the Tories are arming themselves with their tech- niques.\" The Liberal Democrats are using Bidder Braden, the Colo- rado-based company whose cli- ents have included senior sen- ators. The company has conducted polls and written a book about telephone campaigning for the party. It has also worked on occasional by-elections.",

   "text_content" : "Chris Tighe reports on an area in Tyneside where hopelessness is the order of the day UTSIDE the burned-out shops a group of indig- nant teenagers, one cra- dlng a baby, assesses the riot which, the night befoire, devas- tated some of the meagre ame- nities available to residents on the Meadow Well estate. The teenagers insist that the cause of the uproar, in which 300 youths armed with petrol bombs rampaged for five hours, was the crash last Fri- day night in which a local 17- year-old and his 21-year-old friend died as they crashed a stolen Renault Turbo into a lamppost following a police chase. \"They weren't joyriders, they were ramraiders [raiders who enter shops by smashing into them with a car],\" protests 16-year-old Lynne Christie. \"It's totally different, they were doing a job.\" It is a new perspective on the nature of work but, from Meadow Well in North Shields, many aspects of life look differ- ent. A few miles along the Tyne, at the glitzy MetroCentre in Gatephead, the tills are ringing for Scandanavian shoppers; many Meadow Well residents have never been there. Throughout the region in the new Japanese plants and the surviving heavy industry, investment in skills and new technology is the key to suc- cess. The labourers Meadow Well used to provide are no longer needed. In parts of North Tyneside only a handful of schoolchildren qualify for clothing grants; at the Meadow Well primary school it is 100 per cent. Among Meadow Well's 5,000 residents there are people such as local credit union founder Mrs Margaret Nolan who are struggling against great odds to bring some hope to the area. She was refusing, as she clutched the keys to the Com- munity Rights Centre, to be downhearted. \"What happened last night was wrong, but it can't be put right just by blam- ing the people here,\" she says. Many people in Tyne and Wear, exasperated by the county's rising rate of car crime, are happy to dismiss the entire population of estates like Meadow Well as scum. It is just one of a number of north- eastern estates, beached by economic and social change, whose notoriety guarantees their isolation. - -- --- ---- Battleground: the clear-up begins In the sbops and streets at the neart or te aisnirances In meaow weon --- - -- o - :-Â· Â·Â·1Â·-~ : Â·9Â·. ~::., .::Â·;;Â·.Â·Â·: Â·: Â·Â· Mr Alistair Balls, the Tyne and Wear Development Corpo- ration's chief executive, said that even before last night's riot parts of Meadow Well looked as if they had been vis- ited by the Serbian army. That was in spite of Â£18m investment over the last 20 years in upgrading, some of it promptly wrecked by vandals. In an attempt to banish the stigma of the pre-war redbrick estate, North Tynesidb Council even tried changing its name from The Ridges to something gentler - Meadow Well. Now the youth and commu- nity centre is a blackened shell, and many of the shops are charred and gutted. Some of the 100 council workmen sent to try to clean up the wreckage yesterday removed the library's books and Wendy House, fearing more trouble. Government hopes of upgrading council estates through pride in home owner- ship look faint here. Fewer than 10 of the 1,770 dwellings have been sold, and 27 per cent are empty and boarded against wreckers. Nearly a quarter of the chil- dren on North Tyneside's \"at risk\" register live here. Recently social workers have increasingly had to deal with terrified people reporting death threats from neighbours. Some estimates of unemploy- ment on the estate are as high as 82 per cent. Many young people, from homes where nobody has worked for years, hold out no hope of ever being in work. In an attempt to change this, the Tyne and Wear Develop- ment Corporation is starting pre-recruitment training courses in problem estates including Meadow Well. It hopes this will help local q 'qR 1(M) ~-Â·C II Â·Â· people find jobs at its flagship Â£200m Royal Quays develop- ment which borders Meadow Well. Construction has just begun on the \"mini new town\" mixed development, into which the publicly-funded corporation is putting Â£56m, but it has been criticised by North Tyneside Council on the grounds that it will be socially divisive. The corporation disagrees. It even claims in its latest annual report, issued just days ago, that it has \"cracked the prob- lem\" of combining private developers' aspirations with those of local communities and become a European model for economic and social renewal. In spite of the Meadow Well riot, Mr Balls stood by that claim yesterday. \"So long as a few begin to think hopeless- ness isn't the order of the day we're making progress.\" But he admitted the riot would do little to encourage developer confidence even though the consortium behind the scheme was already aware of the prob- lems. \"They've had their win- dows smashed and their cars broken into.\" But the business people in the front line are the small shopkeepers, trying to make a living on a poverty-line estate. Some have complained in pri- vate recently of having to pay protection money. The worst affected by the riot are the Asian shopkeepers who sell tobacco and alcohol. One family, living above their shop, had to take refuge in a nearby house as gangs looted and burned their premises. Some premises survived but the air of hopelessness hangs heavy. Mr Robert Mather, a butcher, says: \"Everybody is incensed by it, but they all blame everybody else.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen A WITHDRAWAL by two potential buyers of Keith Prowse, the ticket agency, led to the receivers being called in on Monday. The buyers had learnt that the company's losses for the year to June 30 were \"substantially\" larger than the Â£3m estimated earlier. After seeing a draft accoun- tants' report, the buyers esti- mated that the company would need to borrow about Â£6m, in addition to the sum of roughly Â£6m it already owed, to see it through December. Royal Bank of Scotland, which estimates that its net loss will be less than Â£2m, became unwilling to extend more credit once hope of a sale of the company disappeared. Several months earlier, it had asked Grant Thornton, the firm appointed as receivers, to advise it on the feasibility of various debt restructuring plans proposed by Keith Prowse. But once the potential buy- ers backed out, Keith Prowse itself called in the receivers. Among other things, it had insufficient cash to pay for the charter of a Concorde flight to the Ryder Cup golf competition in the US or for hospitality tents at the Rugby World Cup. Keith Prowse's difficulties were exacerbated by the sharp drop in tourism during the Gulf war and by reduced demand for corporate hospital- ity by UK businesses suffering from the recession. But its problems predate that period. Consolidated accounts for the 18 months to June 1990 showed a pre-tax loss of Â£696,798 against a profit of Â£179,877 in the calendar year 1968. Compensation to directors in the 18-month period was Â£631,000, more than double that in 1988. The salary of Mr Ranjit Anand, the chairman, rose from Â£62,000 to Â£176,000. Royal Bank of Scotland's total credit line to Keith Prowse is about Â£3m, but bor- rowings are secured by assets, including charges on leasehold properties. The company also owed about Â£1.5m to Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Â£2m to Kellock, an invoice- discounting subsidiary of Bank of Scotland. Keith Prowse's difficulties stemmed, in part, from its attempt to import UK-style hospitality events to the US market. The company has invested roughly Â£5m in the venture since the early 1980s and has lost all of it. The consolidated 1989-90 accounts show that its US sub- sidiary owed more than Â£4m to the parent company, nearly double the level at the end of 1968. The company, which had offices in New York and Atlanta, attempted to interest Americans in attending sport- ing events in style at events such as the American football Superbowl. Finances suffered from the company's move last October to new offices in south London, and the installation of a com- puter with custom-designed software, to expedite ticketing.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Jack THE CONSUMERS' Associa- tion yesterday insisted that London theatres were obliged to honour all tickets sold by Keith Prowse. The association said it believed Keith Prowse was act- ing as an agent for the theatres and entered a binding contract when it sold tickets to the pub- lic. It urged those refused admission to take cases to the small claims court. However, the Society of West End Theatre (Swet), represent- ing theatre owners, managers and producers, said it was \"an extremely complex legal situa- tion\" which it hoped to clarify by tomorrow at a scheduled meeting of its members. Most London theatres have agreed to honour tickets until Saturday, stressing that their action is a gesture of goodwill and should not be seen as an admission of liability. Theatre owners and show producers - already hit by lower attendances this year - are feeling the collapse of Keith Prowse, with large unpaid bills and tickets sold for some performances many months ahead. \"It's a black day for the industry,\" said Mr George Briggs, president of Swet, and a director of Maybox, the owner of theatres including Wyndhams and Albery. Mr Andrew Leigh, director of the Old Vic, said the theatre, currently showing Carmen Jones, was owed Â£100,000 by Keith Prowse, of which Â£12,000 was for forward bookings. \"This event is serious, but we can survive it,\" he said. \"The total loss is less than one week's takings.\" Grant Thornton, the receiv- ers, said it was still calculating the full extent of debts. Up to one quarter of all theatre tick- ets are sold through agencies, and Keith Prowse was the world's largest ticket agency. Some shows already strug- gling with low audiences could face closure as a result of the collapse. Mr Briggs said some musi- cals might be among the hard- est hit. These have large over- seas audiences and are often booked months in advance, types of tickets disproportion- ately sold through agencies. Mr Nick Allott, executive producer for Cameron McIntosh, the theatre impresa- rio, said it was still unclear how far the burden of unpaid tickets would fall on the com- pany. The split of responsibil- ity between theatre owners and show producers appears vague and dependent on the particular legal contracts drawn up. Mr Nick Blackburn, sales director at rival agency Ticket- master, said business had risen slightly yesterday following news of the collapse. One theatre has already handed responsibility for over- flow bookings - when its own box office lines are engaged - from Keith Prowse to Ticket- master. \"Our company is secure and positive in our future,\" he said. He stressed that Ticket- master used a protected or \"venues\" account which safe- guarded money by ensuring that the sums paid by custom- ers were earmarked for pay- ment only to them. Attendance at London thea- tres dropped by 7 per cent to 5m people between the start of this year and mid June, com- pared with the same period last year, according to statis- tics gathered for West End Theatre News, the industry newsletter.",

   "text_content" : "By Ian Hamilton Fazey, Northern Correspondent A NEW type of university college is to be built in north-east England on Tees- side, one of the largest conur- bations in Britain without a university. The buildings will be financed by the government's Teesside Development Corpora- tion and run jointly by Dur- ham University and Teesside Polytechnic. The government yesterday approved Â£8.4m of funding for the first stage of the college, which will be constituted as a university. Building will start next month at Stockton. The first courses will be on offer next year. Durham University and Teesside Polytechnic will form a company limited by guaran- tee with charitable status to manage the new college. It will operate in a similar fashion to a faculty, reporting to both the university senate and the polytechnic's academic board. The college will help fill an institutional gap on Teesside. The proportion of school leav- ers going into higher education in the area has long been run- ning at least 5 per cent below the rest of England and Wales. Some young people have had to go elsewhere for their higher education and have not come back to Teesside. In order to avoid duplication witn tne university ana me polytechnic, the new college will offer courses and research posts in environmental man- agement and technology, off- shore technology, human sci- ence and European studies. These subjects are of great local relevance because of the concentration of chemical and offshore industries on Teesside and the rapid growth of its sea links to continental Europe. Mr Ron Norman, chairman of Teesside Development Cor- poration, said yesterday that the university college would improve the area's status and help inward investment. About 240 students will be enrolled in its first year.",

   "text_content" : ".j-- !nthospitallty: Packa~es arranged by companies for some events are under threat By Richard Evans SOCCER FANS attending the international between England and Germany at London's Wembley Stadium tonight will be virtually unaffected by the collapse of Keith Prowse, in contrast to the uncertainty sac- ing many rugby fans hoping to attend the forthcoming world cup tournament. The difference is caused by the varying methods of ticket sales, particularly those involv- ing corporate hospitality. At Wembley, money is demanded up-front for all ticket sales, including those sold by agen- cies, and corporate hospitality is mostly run by an in-house subsidiary. The 200 packages already sold by Keith Prowse will be honoured. The stadium said: \"The impact of the collapse will be virtually non-existent on us. Anyone who bought through Keith Prowse should have got a ticket, so there should be no problem.\" Similarly, tickets bought by individuals for the rugby world cup will be valid. The question mark is over the corporate hos- pitality packages sold by the organisation when it did not have the tickets. Grant Thornton, the receiv- ers, said that companies that had bought hospitality pack- ages should learn in the next 24 hours whether they would have to forfeit their money. Mr lain Allan, one of the three receivers, said: \"If we cannot sell the hospitality side of the organisation quickly they will all have lost their money.\" Keith Prowse was allocated 42,000 tickets for the 32 matches in the tournament, including 6,000 for the final at Twickenham on November 2, and the organisation offered them for sale in corporate hos- pitality packages. It is under- stood that about 20,000 pack- ages worth Â£6m were sold, although the tickets had not been received from the Rugby Football Union nor paid for. Mr Dudley Wood, RFU secre- tary, said yesterday: \"We made it clear we would not release any tickets for the tournament to Keith Prowse until they were paid for and the cheque cleared. Companies have paid up-front for their packages, and if the receivers require us to release the tickets we would have to do so, but they would have to be paid for.\" Companies that bought hos- pitality packages are likely to be regarded as unsecured cred- itors, and it will be up to the organising committee of the tournament to decide how the tickets are re-allocated. Also at risk are 1,000 pack- ages at up to Â£1,500 each for golfs Ryder Cup. Another potential loser is a recently formed charity, the Rhino Rock Wildlife Fund, which was expecting to receive Â£40,000 to Â£50,000 from a con- cert featuring Placido Domingo held last Saturday. Keith Prowse was the sole ticket agent, and money for the tick- ets has not been paid to the concert organisers.",

   "text_content" : "Alan Friedman reports on the first course on the autumn menu of probes by US officials N THE 268th page of his recently published 700-page memoir, Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary, who last month resigned as chairman of the Washington-based First American Bancshares, makes a brief reference to the scandal over BCCL He denies any knowledge of BCCI's secret control of Fist American, which was revealed by the Federal Reserve in July. The 85year-old Mr Clifford's reputation as a Democratic fixer, elder statesman and kingmaker was untarnished until the BOCI scandal broke. But his situation has been complicated by the fact that for several years he served not only as First American chair- man, but also as a lawyer and lobbyist for BCCL In his mem- oir he gwaerly terms the scan- dal \"an unfortunate contro- versy\".

Mr Naqvi was indicted again last week, this time by a Flo- rida grand jury on charges of racketeering and the launder- ing of drug profits from the Medellin cocaine cartel in Col- ombia. In a move that has perplexed BCCI investigators all over the world, the governmeit of Abu Dabi this week arrested more than 30 former top executives, including Mr Naqvi. The arrests are curious because Shelkh Zayed bin Sultan al-Na- hyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi - who along with other insti- tutions owns 77.4 per cent of BCCI - has protete lodly about the aseure of the bank.

The Post said the larger and mor troubl questions arise from \"the pecullarly dow and slack handlingof this case by a long list of federal agencies\". Indeed this autumn's menu of BCCI events in the US will feature a mixture o new allegations and charges on the one hand and Congressio- nal scrutiny aimed at ascer- taining whether US officials engaged in a cover-up or were incompetent in their lethargic reaction to the abundant evi- dence of criminality at BCCI over the peAt eit years.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent VAUXHALL, the second-placed carmaker in the UK new-car market, has raised the prices of a substantial part of its range by an average of 2.5 per cent. The increases, which came into effect yesterday, follow the move late last week by Ford, the UK market leader for new cars, which increased the prices of many of its models by an average of 3.9 per cent. Vauxhall raised prices in January by an average of 3.6 per cent. The company's latest move is a further sign that manufacturers are withdrawing from the price war triggered by Ford at the beginning of July. It has been used largely as a means for carmakers to clear stocks of old cars before the autumn start of the 1992 product year in the face of the severe recession in new-car demand. Ford initiated a campaign of cutting the list prices of old stocks of selected models by Â£1,000 to Â£2,000, while Vauxhall offered cash-back rebates of up to Â£1,500. Vauxhall is waiting to set rates for its new generation Astra - one of the most important new cars to be launched in the UK this year - until the mid-October introduction of the range, a move which has forced Ford to delay announcing any price rises for its rival Escort/Orion series. Ford's price cutting initiative failed to halt the erosion of its market share in August when its sales fell to 80,102 from 105,341 a year earlier, a decline from 24.3 per cent to 21.8 per cent. It is under heavy financial pressures in the UK in the face of falling sales, production cuts and the introduction of a three-day week at its assembly plant in Halewood, Merseyside, and the mounting losses of its Jaguar, the luxury car subsidiary.

   "text_content" : "By David Churchill BROTHERS Ranjit and Devindra Anand were the driv- ing force behind the Keith Prowse Expotel group and, according to insiders as well as trade colleagues, were very different in style. Mr Dev (as he is known to friends) Anand was the flamboyant extrovert, while his brother looked after the financial side. They built a flourishing hotel reservations operation - Expotel - in the 1970s by con- centrating on small business accounts that leading travel agency chains did not consider were worthwhile. The Anand brothers negoti- ated discounts with business hotel chains throughout the world that made it possible for them to offer companies some of the lowest hotel prices around. The strategy made Expotel, which was sold earlier this week, the largest UK hotels reservation agency, booking some 300,000 hotel beds a year to the value of more than Â£50m. According to trade sources, this gave Expotel about as many hotel bookings as those made by American Express and Thomas Cook combined. Exactly a decade ago, the Anand brothers believed that the same skills that had made them successful in hotel reser- vations could be used for thea- tre ticketing. It acquired the Keith Prowse name and operations from the Midland News Association. Mr Paul Burns, who had joined Keith Prowse in 1980, was put in charge of the tick- eting side of the business, leaving the brothers to develop the Expotel operation. These three are understood to account between them for some 84 per cent of the shares.",

   "text_content" : "t By Michael Smith, Labour Correspondent s EMPLOYEES of Lloyds Bank are to be urged to take indus- trial action after unions and management failed to reach agreement on a revised pay structure. At talks, held under the aus- pices of the Acas conciliation service, management indicated it was prepared to withdraw proposals which unions believe could see members' pay fall by up to Â£2,600 after three years. However, the concession was not enough to satisfy union demands over the most com- EMPLOYMENT prehensive salary-structure reform proposed by any of the big four clearing banks. Bifu, the financial services union, said that it would organise a ballot on a series of one-day strikes. Lloyds group union may consider a similar move. Both unions say that under the proposals, which would be implemented on October 1, a significant proportion of their members would be regraded into jobs for which the pay rate is less than their present earn- ings. Under the bank's initial pro- posals individuals' pay would have been held steady for three years. After that, however, if they were still overpaid for their grade, their earnings could have fallen. The unions expect the bank to announce today that pay cuts after three years will no longer be implemented. Instead pay would be frozen, but would not rise in line with the cost of living, until the new salary caught up with the old. The unions are protesting because they believe the new salary scales are below those of competitors. They are also opposed to the bank's decision to abandon the tradition of awarding an annual pay rise to all non- managerial employees as a matter of course. Under an appraisal system employees rated as performing poorly would be entitled to nei- ther a cost-of-living increase nor an annual increment. The bank says its proposed structure disturbs career pat- terns as little as possible. The aim, it says, is to pay competi- tive rates in order to motivate and retain the right calibre of people.",

Nissan Yamato, a pressings manufacturer in which Nissan Motor has a majority stake, told the AEU that a single- union agreement might be negotiated if most of the com- pany's non-managerial employ- ees were in favour. The workers voted by 144 to 118 votes against the union being given a role. The vote is a setback for the union, which already has an agreement with Nissan Motor to represent some of its workers. The Labour party has said it intends to create a new legal right for unions to be recog- nised where there is \"substan- dal support among employees at the workplace\". However, the vote at Nissan Yamato in Washington, Tyne and Wear, highlights the prob- lems unions have in convinc- ing workers of their value at greenfield sites or in areas where they have previously not been represented. Mr Bill Morgan, an AEU executive councillor, said Nis- san Yamato had given the union all the facilities it had sought to help persuade work- ers of the value of a recogni- tion deal. He attributed the loss of the vote to the fact that many of the workers were relatively young people who had not worked in manufacturing before and had no experience of trade unionism. The union hoped to organise another vote.",

The study, by the National Association of School- masters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), shows teachers working almost 52 hours a week on average - 39 minutes more a week than in a similar survey in 1990. However the time spent teaching has fallen by more than an hour a week since the 1990 survey. The teachers sur- veyed taught for just over 40 per cent of work time, with the rest spent on marking, prepa- ration and administration. The union attributes the extra work to government reforms such as the introduc- tion of the national curriculum and local management of school budgets. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said the survey showed teach- ers working more than 2,000 hours a year, compared with the 1,800 hours a year worked by people on a standard 37% hour week. \"The extra work- load for the government's under-funded introduction of teacher appraisal later this year will only make the situa- tion worse,\" he said.

   "text_content" : "Patrick Harverson reports that the US securities industry is reining in salaries and bonuses A 26-year-old Wall Street trader who earned more than $2m last year is suing his former employers for not paying him enough. At the same time, the $23m paid to a trader at a rival securities firm continues to embarrass his employers, long after the pay- ment was first uncovered by the press. The two huge pay cheques were both awarded at the end of a year which was, by most measures, the worst ever for the US securities industry. In 1990 the seven largest broking houses recorded pre-tax losses totalling $678m, management heads rolled and thousands of employees were made redun- dant. At first glance it might look as if little has changed on Wall Street since the boom years of the 1980s, when management handed out extravagant rewards like confetti at a Broadway parade. Yet the law- suit over the unpaid millions and the blushes caused by the $23m payout are evidence of change, not inertia. At the height of the bull market in the 1980s the lawsuit 1 would have been unlikely a because the 26-year-old trader a would have earned considera- 5 bly more than $2m, and the t securities firm that handed a over $23m would not have a blushed quite so red at the size i of the payment because few s would have regarded it as ' excessive. V Today, the climate has changed. Senior managers at s Wall Street firms have learned I their lesson from the 1980s, t when pay and compensation r ate up vast amounts of a revenues. According to Sibson, g a US human resources manage- s ment consultancy, between t 1985 and 1990 compensation if and related expenses accounted for as much as 80 to 85 per cent of distributable pre- k tax earnings at the big securi- 1 ties houses. f That might have been t acceptable when markets, and t profits, were booming. But a since the slump in margins and - earnings began in 1990, firms s have woken up to the need to a rein in compensation costs. f The result has been that management is taking a 1 tougher line, especially on the t issue of bonuses, which to Wall r Street executives have always r been the main course after the salary appetiser. Not only are Â· bonuses now smaller, they are I being shared and paid out dif- i ferently. Most important of all, man- r agement has learnt that com- i pensation costs cannot be brought under control until an i organised system for allocating t bonuses is introduced to the I decision-making process. , Vincent Perro, principal with i Sibson, says: \"Most firms f didn't have, until recently, a disciplined approach to making decisions about bonuses based i on contributions.\" I One new approach on Wall i Street, says Perro, is to treat ) bonuses as capital invest- - ments, subject to the same - kind of rules and scrutiny applied to capital equipment. 1 This means regularly review- 1 ing the return a firm gets from t each employee, and then decid- I ing if the return is reasonable ; relative to what the employee ) is paid. Introducing performance t assessment is not easy. Judg- i ing a trader by his profit and 3 loss account is relatively 1 straightforward, but how do you judge the returns brought in by an investment banker? Not all investment bankers are responsible for initiating and completing a deal. Whole teams will work on deals, with everyone making different con- tributions. In the past, the solution was to pay everyone involved a similar share, which meant that those who processed investment banking deals were paid almost as much as those who originated them. his practice is now changing, with awards more strictly tailored to revenue production. The \"rain- makers\" - those who originate deals - still make the big money, but the rest are having to make do with a smaller share of team and departmen- tal bonuses. This process of sorting out the real revenue earners and paying them a lot more than the rest can create tensions within a firm. Wall Street egos have always been big, primar- ily because the old system of sharing bonuses enabled every- one to feel like a \"Master of the Universe\". Pooled bonuses have not been phased out, but managers have become more careful about who gets what, and the size of pools have shrunk under the pressure of slimmer profit margins. Sibson esti- mates that in 1990, Wall Street bonus pools were cut by 20 to 30 per cent. The decline in bonus earnings per head was smaller because redundancies reduced the number of people sharing the cake, but even then per capita bonuses dropped by an estimated 10 to 20 per cent. Those who were lucky enough to get a bonus last year (in some firms they were fro- zen), did not always get their hands on it straight away. Firms have been increasingly paying bonuses in the form of stock or stock options (this has the dual effect of postponing payment and binding employ- ees closer to the company), while some have deferred cash payments until a later date. Implementing change would have been easier this year if the first six months had not proved so enriching for the securities industry. The near- record profits earned on Wall Si o Iaoo . M Ivor Source: Sibson & Company analysis of major securities firms I oo I 0O oUwvo. MLarI y a %qww m\" % ITMu w Street since January have raised expectations of hand- some bonuses among many dealers, salesmen, and invest- ment bankers (at least those involved in the booming busi- ness of stock and bond under- writing, rather than the still- stagnant mergers and acquisi- tions). Yet employers have had to warn staff not to expect big bonuses. As Joan Zimmerman of GZ Stephens, a New York executive recruiting firm, explains: \"Companies are try- ing to prepare staff for a differ- ent attitude to compensation.\" This new attitude, says Zim- I- merman, could lead to clashes V over pay. \"Senior management is cautious [about bonuses], e but investment bankers, trad- i- ers and salespeople are already .. looking at this year's record I- profits and trying to calculate their portion of the fees.\" Change is not just limited to o the million-dollar earners. Pay g levels are also being altered at . the entry level. During the k boom years graduates joining Wall Street (especially those from Ivy League universities like Harvard and Yale) could expect a healthy starting sal- n- ary of somewhere around es $50,000 a year, plus a guaran- at teed bonus, often paid up-front 0, as a signing-on fee. Within a d- year or so the smart graduate ly could look forward to a pack- rd age running into hundreds of te thousands of dollars. Not so today. Starting sal- to aries are modest by the old iy standards (no more, it seems, at than $60,000), and bonuses are ie not paid until they are earned. ig What securities houses are se doing is reviving something es that seemed to have died out a Id long time ago on Wall Street: il- the apprenticeship.",

   "text_content" : "M easured by the usual standards, Hydro-Quebec should be a dar- ling of the environmental lobby. North America's third biggest power utility generates 95 per cent of its capacity from hydro-electric dams on Que- bec's fast-flowing rivers, thus providing an abundant, cheap, clean and renewable form of energy. Far from winning praise, however, the Montreal-based utility has found itself on the defensive over its plans to cre- ate a huge hydro-electric grid in the sub-arctic wildnerness of northern Quebec. The advantages of hydro- electric power have been over- shadowed by fears that vast new reservoirs, diverted rivers and an influx of European workers and tourists will cause irreparable harm to remote Cree Indian and Inuit (Eskimo) communities on the desolate shores of Hudson Bay. The natives have been joined by a plethora of environmen- tal, religious and labour groups in the north-east US, where Hydro-Quebec is selling a growing proportion of its power output. These groups contend that states such as New York and Vermont, which have signed tentative contracts with Hydro-Quebec, would be better off concentrating on energy conservation or sup- porting local power companies, than supporting Quebec's econ- omy with imported energy. Hydro-Quebec's opponents chalked up a victory in August when the New York Power Authority and Hydro-Quebec agreed to extend by one year, to November 1992, the deadline for either party to withdraw from a 1,000-megawatt contract due to begin in 1995. The official reason for the delay is that the recession has eaten into electricity demand, so that the Quebec power will not now be needed as soon as expected. But the extension will inevitably force a closer examination of the ecological impact of the next phase of the development, centred on the Great Whale River. Hydro-Quebec began har- nessing the rivers of northern Quebec in the early 1970s with k the construction of the first phase of the La Grande com- plex around the eastern shore of James Bay (the \"toe\" at the southern tip of Hudson Bay). Three generating stations have been built on the La Grande River, producing a total of 10,2OMW of electricity. Even this first phase incldes some of the world's biggest hydroelctric failities.

The wall of the LG2 reservoir is 2.8km long. HydroQuebec is now in the midst of an expansion on the La Grande and surrounding rivers, which will add another six generating stations and 5,100MW. When this phase is completed, the waters of the La Grande river will prodce elec- tricity at seven dirent sites over a distance of 800km. The C$l2bn (Â£6.1bn) Great Whale project, about 200km north of La Grande, is the next stage of the northera Quebec grid, which could eventually supply a quarter of al North America's hydro-electric power.

This will severely disrupt fishing in the area, and may also contaminate bears and birds which feed off the fish, he predicts.

To sup port their cae, they point to the e*xperince over the past IS years t the La Gralteprleet High mercury levels, which were not foreseen when con- struction began, have led to a total ban on fishing in the La Grande reservon.

But Iydo Quebec contens that man of the coats wl be eonet by beneits, such a Aons in the Eadrta eoom y, and spending by tourists. The util- ity is also confident that mer- cury levels in the dams and rivers will eventually subside, allowing fishing to resume within 20-30 years. Whatever the rights and wrongs of each side's case, the furore over Great Whale is for- cing a much closer assessment of its environmental impact than Hydro-Quebec's earlier projects. The first phase of La Grande began in the 1970s without any prior environmental impact studies. Hydro-Quebec started monitoring the project's eco- logical impact soon after, but began only two to three years ago making its findings avail- able to anyone other than a select group of scientists. A review of the impact of roads and other infrastructure for Great Whale was published last December. A full study of the project itself is due to be released in November. To the annoyance of the Quebec authorities, the federal govern- ment in Ottawa has set up its own environmental review. Hydro-Quebec employs 180 people in its environment divi- sion. In an effort to catch up in the battle for public sympathy in the US, it is translating more of its French-language material into English, and now regularly sends senior officials to take part in public hearings in the states where it hopes to sell electricity. Under pressure from envi- ronmentalists, the utility also made a significant change a month ago to plans for Great Whale. Diversion plans for the adjacent Little Whale River r has been altered to avoid slow- r ing the flow of the ecologically e sensitive Nastapoka River to v the north.

   "text_content" : "sk Jan Morovic a straight question and you get a preci- sion-tooled answer. When did the groundwork begin for his ambitious plan to spread manage- ment teaching across Czechoslo- vakia? \"April 26 1990.\" When was his first meeting with a consultant from the Open Univer- sity Business School, whose mate- rial he is using? \"One month later. It was raining - and you were 1% hours late,\" he says, with a mischie- vous glance towards Brian Lund, the man in question. It is the sort of attention to detail required from someone who has developed an idea for management training, chosen a model, identified curricula materials, translated and partially rewritten them, trained tutors and recruited his first class of students, all in 16 months. Morovic, a senator in the Czecho- slovak federal assembly, founded the City University of Bratislava in June 1990 with the aim of teaching practical management skills for the market economy by \"distance learn- ing\". His institution will be offi- cially opened on September 18. The strategy relies heavily on the pattern adopted by the Open Busi- ness School, a faculty within the Open University in the UK. Stu- dents learn at home or workplace using audio and videotapes and workbooks, supported by tutors. This approach, without the need for heavy central overheads like full-time teaching staff, has allowed the Open Business School to grow rapidly since it was established in 1983. It currently has 22,000 stu- dents enrolled on its management courses, and over 3,000 on the MBA programme alone - more than one third of all British MBA students. Enrolment spread within three years to Belgium, initially for Brit- ish people working in the European Community, and then for other nationals. It has since opened cen- tres in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Eire, and plans to expand into Italy and perhaps Greece and Denmark next year. Its courses have been marketed under licence to the Budapest Open Man- agement School in Hungary. Now Brian Lund, a consultant with the Open Business School, has helped to develop a partnership with the e City University in Bratislava to use d the British course materials. City University has spent about d Â£300,000 so far developing the e courses, paid for through contribu- d tions to an endowment fund from Aw businesses and city and state fund- n ing. It has also received Â£10,000 i- from a British Foreign Office fund it supporting the restructuring of k eastern Europe, and is optimistic of e receiving a further Â£90,000. Each new student will pay Â£200, e compared with Â£825 for those who t- take the courses in the UK. The n Open Business School has negoti- r ated a royalty fee of Â£50 for each i- student enrolled, but is considering r, reducing the fee. o Teaching management skills will s not be easy. It requires the develop- s ment of a new vocabulary. The con- r cept of a \"manager\", for example, i- has not previously existed in v Czechoslovakia, says Morovic. The e nearest equivalent was a \"control- d ler\", whose responsibility it was to e ensure that a state plan was met. \"These people had no free space for decisions, but simply fulfilled the t plan,\" he says. a Other new entries to be intro- * duced into the glossary of business i jargon include mission statements, targets, efficiency, effectiveness and 9 even decision taking, he says. i Some managerial ideas have f existed in the past, but have been f interpreted in different ways. The word \"plan\", for example, is now l, heavily stigmatised. Discussing the 3 idea of a strategic business plan e sends shivers down the spine of .- many new entrepreneurs, who asso- 1 ciate it with the government plans g of the past. Personnel skills will also present 1 challenges. The concept of manag- ing people in order to bring about - implementation rather than simply , declare objectives is novel, accord- 1 ing to Morovic. So is the idea of e career development, which was pre- - viously considered both impractical , and selfish. At the same time, there is an urgent need for training in such areas as financial analysis. Enter- prises must learn how to establish their own pricing structures where previously the state determined centrally what could be charged. The pace and scale of Morovic's approach is extremely ambitious. He recruited 41 English-speaking candidates last autumn, and enrolled them on the basic Open Business School course, \"The Effec- tive Manager\" in October 1990. They are now helping translate this first module into Slovak, and will begin offering teaching support for it next month. Morovic stresses the importance of scrupulous trans- lation in that it should reflect the spirit of the words. Some examples and illustrations may also be redrafted to make them more rele- vant to Czechoslovakia. Of the 36 who completed the course and passed in May, 33 are now studying a second module in English, \"Accounting and PC for managers\". The hope is to translate this course into both Czech and Slo- vak, along with two others, \"Manag- ing Health Services\" and \"Manag- ing Customer and Client Relations\", for the next academic year. \"It was very important for us to choose teachers who want to learn a new culture of management, to support the transformation of the whole culture of management,\" says Morovic. \"We picked some young people who can adopt and adapt these new concepts.\" Teach- ing staff from existing schools with more traditional methods and understanding of business were not selected. Morovic says his initial target audience includes small entrepre. neurs, staff of central and state gov- ernment bodies and finance and insurance companies. More than 220 students have already enrolled, including recent college graduates and whole boards of senior execu tives in enterprises. They will spend several weeks learning how to study before starting work on the * H I iI I- 0 e e d i- d it *t r- d d o e . Jan Morovlc: attenton to detail >t formal course in November.

The captivating moment is cap- tured by cameras from three television channels. The children explain how they collect and sell used alu- minium cans, not only to reduce waste and litter but also for the money which buys extra equipment for their school. The setting is the island of Skyros where the mayor is hosting celebrations to mark Greece's National Aluminium Recycling Day. It is one more coup in the aluminium industry's cam- paign to promote the idea that it produces \"green\" or environ- mentally friendly packaging. In the propaganda war the alu- minium companies are leaving the steel can makers, their main rivals in the fzlzy drinks packaging business, well behind. Later in the day the children play and distribute leaflets about aluminium can recycling as Skyros' mayor makes a speech and introduces 11 other people, mainly local politi- cians, who also want to have their say. Like the 17 mayors from other municipalities who have travelled to the island, half an hour's flight north of Athens, the politicians have had to do their homework. By now they are fuly aware of the benefits claimed for aluminium cans: that alumianium is particularly suitable for recyclig because it can be melted down into new metal again and again without loss of qality that up to 96 per cent of the earp slina reeltag process because the origal energy inveted is pre served in the metal; and as Ona The elS of linktag iatures of hpp children wth a proa- uct or campign is not orisial But the Alumunium Anacia- t at of G also ued t Bmr alMU iumUUHR rCJeIHR aed top eamots Ife i th lb dsHr put it ilNUS a -A - Iif poss a view, the Brussels bureaucrats explained EC ideas about such matters as recycling, packag- ing, waste management, educa- tion, energy and taxation - all topics in which the aluminium industry has a vested interest. The Greek Aluminium Associa- tion started its can recycling campaign as recently as 1966. In that year 22m cans were recycled. In 1990 the total was up to 110m. Today 24 munici- palities in Greece and four communities are running alu- minium recycling projects. The association also gained Minis- try of Education approval to take the campaign into the schools and now has more than 400 elementary and high schools on its list. It provides information material and tech- nical equipment and keeps in constant touch with teachers Europe's recycling rate lags that in China, Hong Kong and Korea, where 90 per cent of used beverage cans are collected and re-used and parents' associations. The Greek armed sores also have aluminium can recycling progamnmes. For example, se- =cli containers for colecting can hve been placed on a the Greek Navy's vessels and in Navy traning camps. The Greek association has been able to draw heavily on the experience of the Alumin- ium Can Recycling Auolation (Acra) st up to prnomoe the m- p t hrotlihO BIUC by some of the world's bluest pro cer Alman of Canada, two US graps, Alcoa and Reyl ds, iPdiNrey of Fkuen ad VAWof Gernany.

The industry is put- ar ting its new production plants u- in areas outside Europe where he energy is cheap.

About 80 per cent of aluminium used in building and more than 90 per cent used in transport components is recycled. By these standards o the can business is not doing particularly well because the industry estimates that by the end of last year its recycling rate was running at about 20 4 per cent. However, this brought in 25,000 tonnes of used aluminium cans. Europe's recycling rate lags so that in China, where 90 per ag cent of used beverage cans are w- collected and re-used.

   "text_content" : "sTAVE you heard of thd two H 1 men who first met as MH Mtrainee naval officers? Before leaving college for their careers in the service, they made a solemn pact that whenever either heard the other's name raised in conversation, he'd butt in with: \"Did I hear you mention Soand-so? He's a marvellous chap, absolutely first-class.\" Both ended up as Admirals. I owe that career-parable to serendipity. There I was at a bus stop, beside which was a junk shop, outside which was a tray of books all priced at 50p. The only one still in its paper cover was called The Boss, and I bought it on impulse as the bus approached. Several days passed before I began reading and discovered my luck. For instance, one of the two authors turned out to be Britain's foremost student of what managers do in reality - as distinct from what egg-head theory ordains they should do - Rosemary Stewart, now of Templeton College, Oxford. The second author is one of the doyens of British journalism, Roy Lewis who tells me he got the naval story from his late brother, an RN captain. Another happy surprise was that, although the book was published a third of a century ago, a a in 1958, its observations seem n remarkably up-todate. Apart from i: antique pay and tax figures, its >? only jarring sign of age is failure to ly admit that managers can be female, referring to them throughout as \"business men\". o But it compensates by being is unfashionably frank about what's p, needed to get on in management, :s especially in big outfits. Indeed it is 11 so frank that, were I writing for ie anyone less life-hardened than Jobs is column readers, I wouldn't have the heart to pass the message on. I The tale I began with is but one y of many warnings that the qualities o recruiters babble about - technical 's merit, devotion to the actual work, * integrity and the like - are no n guarantee of high promotion. More y probably, they are a handicap. t, For the authors stress that the L managers discussed by economists e and the like are mere theoretical y dreams. Real-world management e \"is not a purely competitive game r, in which business men only keep on top by making larger profits or Is smaller losses than other business s men. It is a system of power, a ), hierarchy of positions\" in which top executives' ambitions may well clash with the best interests of the companies they run. The typical boss's prime motive is a mission \"to mould other men into a pattern of his own\", we're told. \"In fact, one of the major outlets for business ability is not building a business but capturing command of a business which has already been built, and which, by its size and momentum and its firm grip on its own specialities, may be virtually indestructible in one autocrat's lifetime.\" What is more, medical evidence suggests that \"among those in senior positions in an organization, the tendency to hold on to power as such is apt to increase as real capacity diminishes.\" Meanwhile, \"it is almost always to their advantage to keep their mouths shut\" about how the power was won. One reason is that there will typically have been times when the executive has had \"to repeat to himself Cromwell's words 'regrettable necessity' as he sacrifices friends, betrays confidences, turns the screws with threats, unmasks unexpected ell batteries of blackmail, enters into be pacts with enemies, even men he despises and regards as wholly ve disastrous to the company.\" Mn Which is surely enough to re convey the book's broad view of or how people get on in management. ot The trouble is that, not being a ig top executive myself, I can't say as whether the analysis is right. But by at least it makes a refreshing m change from the standard careers ay and recruitment literature. ae D OW to the table alongside ce 11which is drawn from Day in Associates' latest quarterly survey n, of pay and perks in nearly 80 banks as in the City of London.

Mr Clark says that, while \"snap- shot\" figures for specific jobs fail to show it, pay levels in City banking are coming d6wn in the sense that overall increases are running at a rate lower than inflation. That does not mean real-value cuts are being made in the base salaries of staff who have survived the recession, although reduced bonuses have left a fair number worse off as a whole. What is happening is that, when essential jobs are left vacant by departures or promotions, the replacements are being brought in at lower pay - the Parable of the Vineyard. Michael Dixon",

   "text_content" : "On a pillar like that of Simeon Stylites stands a statuesque blonde, dressed like Superwoman in the colours of the American flag red and white headband and sequin- ned bustier, blue stretch satin knickers, white knee pads and box- ing boots. She is holding a large rubber shield. Thirty or 40 feet away stands another woman, done up like Tweedledum or an Ameri- can footballer, with crash helmet, visor, and padded one-piece suit. She takes hold of a rope, swings through the air like Tarzan, and crashes into the blonde who stag- gers around her tiny platform but avoids falling. There is ecstatic applause from the studio audience. To the left another pair of women go through the same performance, but in this case the stylite is knocked from her pillar to land on deep rubber cushions. The \"event\" has lasted about five seconds, though it took three or four min- utes to set up, with explanations from not one but two presenters, and it is followed by long and ear- nest discussions between presenters and contestants about how things went. They could not be more seri- ous, nor more detailed in their anal- ysis, if this was a world chess cham- pionship or a Wimbledon final rather than a po-faced American version of It's A Knockout. The scene is not familiar to you? You have never watched American Gladiators? What on earth do you get up to at two o'clock on a Satur- day morning? Perhaps you live in one of the ITV areas where the pro- gramme is not shown... or maybe the early hours of the morning are not-your favourite viewing time. For insomniacs and shift workers who do like to watch through the night, the material provided by Brit- ish television proves to be weird and wonderful - though only for a week or so. After that it becomes intolerable, being aimed almost exclusively, it seems, at teenagers who ard assumed to be either drunk or mentally deficient. There are exceptions to this rule for those of us with satellite dishes. At any time of the night we can switch to Sky News and, within a short time, see a news bulletin with, between times, all sorts of features and reports including American news programmes from CBS. Ftur- thennore Sky Sports was staying on their last week until 3.00 am or so to brin us the US Open Tennis Championship from Flushing Meadow, so we were able to lounge around in the middle of the night watching the terrifying Monica Seles beat Jennifer Capriati who proved even more frightening because, at 15, two years younger than Seles, she came close to win- ning. Better still, we could watch Jimmy Connors, 39, like some old knight in the lists, needing to be winched into the saddle but then, with the euphoria of the crowd, los- ing his stiffiess and finding that he icould still do all his old tricks and beat just about every young chal- lenger in the contest. It made splen- did inspirational entertainment. It was the exception, however, which highlights the rule, the rule appearing to be that late night tele- vision must be very cheap. What that, in turn, means is that it is more likely than not to be a pro- ae. gramme offering free promotion to ers movies or, above all, rock music. the Switch on at random any night of rit- the week between midnight and, Ird say, five in the morning and you are r a more likely to find yourself watch- ies ing a video - of Cher, M.C.Ham- ist mer, Madonna - than anything ers else. This is most likelyi of all for ak dishowners because two of the all- night satellite channels, MTV and ale Lifestyle, are devoted entirely to es. rock videos. an Even if you stick to terrestrial ka television, pop music is still a sta- th, ple. The Hit Man And Her is a series res recorded in clubs and presented by an a middle aged man in a grey suit ur- teamed with a pert girl in a bathing on costume and little black shorts. In so London it goes out on ITV at 4.15 on ils Sunday mornings and this week, ng shortly after 5.00 am, he and she ige were, more or less, holding up a ght sheet in a club in Redruth while Ica two boy/girl couples behind it com- ho peted to see which pair could swap ng clothes fastest. It probably seems ger hilarious if you are 16 and full of in- Grolsch. Bhangra Beat, shown by rch ITV thre hours earlier, pursues Ald 4cially parate development in be op in Britain with the same en, dedication that British broadcasters os- have always opposed apartheid in he South Africa. nd Raw Power at 3.35 on Saturday al- mornings brings you an hour of en- heavy metal - well, that is what last week's edition did, anyway, er, with painfully loud stuff from Mega- ale death, Anthrax and the like - then 4le- at 2.15 on Thursday mornings and iat again at 4.30 am on Fridays you can is watch Kasey Kasem (who makes ro- Alan Freeman look youthful) pres- to enting America's Top 10. And that ic. brings us to the second striking of point about Britain's all-night tele- id, vison most of it is American. re In- many cases, of course, this is ,hi unremarkable. For decades webhave mi- been watching action drama from ag the US such as the vengeance series or The Equalizer (currently screenied ill- in London and some other ITV ad areas at one o'clock on Wednesday to morngs), American comedies such as Co (an unfunny series about lal an egocentric sports teacher show- ta- ing at 1.45 on Sunday mornings) es and movies such as the 30-year-old by John Wayne Western The Corn- lit mancheros which was seen on much ng of the ITV network between 12.15 In and 2.15 am last Thursday. on But what are we in Kentish Town &k, supposed to make of a series which he habitually employs phrases such as a \"And now! The number one film in Ile multiplexes and drive-ins from m- coast to coast\"? From Blackpool to ap Scarborough?.-Hardly, because we ns are told later - in the programme of called CinemAttractions (thirtyso- by mething has a lot to answer for) - es that we are about to \"count down in the Top 10 films in the popcorn pal- ne aces and passion pits of America\". 'rs The programme appears to be noth- in ing but a sequence of free plugs for current movies, and if the ITV com- ay panies are not charging the film of makers for showing them they jolly lat well should be. ly, The ominous factor, however, is ra- the casual assumption by the en broadcasters that British viewers ad can be put onto a diet of American an culture without any modifications es or explanations. In the 8% hours ?s- between nine o'clock in the evening it this coming Friday and 5.30 the g next morning, 1TV in London will e- show a 30-minute British news programne, a one-hour British rock Is pro e, and eight American re programes lasting seven hours.

V Many readers will never have h seen any of the programmes 15 mentioned; here, but it would be unwise to assume that they can be a safely ignored and left to meander h along in the distant tributaries of as the night, presenting no threat to . the more demanding viewer of peak n time schedules. Experience over the *o last 10 years suggests that what is re used to top up remote tributaries ie today may well be diverted into the \" mainstream tomorrow - especially if it is cheap and the language used n is English, or something proximate. ' The temptation to start bringing in * rubbish of this sort to the main schedules once the Government's )r demented scheme for auctioning I- ITV franchises has begun to have n its effect may well be too powerful ly for some broadcasters to resist. is Given the ratings that used to be e achieved by It's A Knockout the lure .s of Knock-The-Lady-Off-The-Pillar n could prove irresistible in a s post-auction world.

   "text_content" : "Mark Morris & Co. have gone home. The American choreographer, his dancers and their administrative staff have returned to the States, after three years' residence in Brussels. In all dance history there is no precedent for what began in Belgium in 1988: a choreographer and his company moving lock, stock and barrel to another country. And there has been nothing much even like it since the early 20-century Ballets Russes (whose repertories were composed of works by more choreographers than one and which were conceived as nomadic ensembles). A pity, for Europe, that the experiment is over. In few countries would it be conceivable or possible to Import an entire foreign dance troupe. The Morris company came at the invitation of G6rard Mortier, director of Brussels's prestigious opera house, the Th6etre Royal de la Monnaie, who is now moving on to direct the Salzburg Festival. Some of Morris's dancers had given up more lucrative teaching work in America because they felt they \"had to be part\" of the Brussels experience. In less than a year, however, it became evident that, when Morris's three-year contract ended, no one on either side would apply to renew it. 1989 involved some hostile Brussels reviews and some heavy Belgian booing. What the company objected to most, however, was Brussels and the Belgians. In 1991, despite improved reviews and happier audiences, these Americans feel the same way. When I saw him, Morris was about to spend a last weekend in Amsterdam, which he loves. I asked him to compare the Dutch and the Belgians. \"Open - Closed,\" he said. \"It's that simple. The Belgians keep their minds closed. I think they've been like that for five centuries. The faces in the Flemish paintings are the same, only their clothes were more cute.\" Morris, the world's most talented loudmouth, has more than once given offence in Brussels with his remarks to the press. A 1989 Vanity Fair quoted his remark about Queen Fabiola's \"Maggie Thatcher r hairdo of death,\" and last year The Times printed his considered view, as follows: \"\"It's a strange society and it's very glum in general. It's also highly racist, highly sexist, highly homophobic and highly conservative, and there are certain aspects that are quite fascistic.\" red The Monnale, he says, \"is a giant mess - and sometimes something fabulous happens there. Well, it's an ra housel I hope Ill work there agin Right now, Im scared to leave and I'm scared to stay. \"It's been really, really hard here. Because of this sort of isolation, we're not a company that spends time with other companies. Here, we only see us.\" 1: This, nonetheless, has proved the making of the company. s's The company's organisation has improved. The dancers have been ica thrown together, and know each other very well. And it has become a staple of company life that Morris teaches company class. is's I watched him teach a two-hour e class. There is no hint of repression :ew or embarrassment in him. He attends to very fine details of style F and musicality, and he takes pleasure in his own work. \"You're gonna like this,\" he tells the dancers as he prepares to teach them one sequence. Afterwards, as he analyses it for them, he says \"It's like moon-walking.\" Watching them dance, he yells a series of instructions: \"Espressivo!\" and, later, \"Sauvage!\" Then he gives them specific advice. \"There are three disorders of the neck,\" he says; and he demonstrates each one. (The second he calls \"the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtle Neck\"; the third is \"cervical paralysis\".) When he flnishes teaching bare, he re announces \"That was a good barrel Peppy, snappy, Informative, ed musical.\" Some of the n dancers the i company acquired, when it moved ity to Europe, were European. Three years on, it is impressive to find Ir that some of these are staying with the troupe now that it has moved back to the States. When I asked him to name any work that had been a turning-point in his career, he named three: Barstow (his first), Gloria (his first re to baroque choral music) and Behemoth. The latter work organised dancers, space, time and at phrasing as orris never had g before; it be sinificant that sd The company drew its Brussels period to a close by giving a studio performance of a triple bill to a gathering of friends. The three works moved backwards in time. First, an as yet unfinished Haydn . work (which has recently had its premiere with the White Oak Dance Project); then Behemoth; is and finally, one of Morris's earliest i and best loved works, the 1982 New Love Song Waltzes. ie About the new work, Morris ris simply announced, \"This piece is to Haydn's horn concerto no r 2. We're showing you excerpts . on because, so far, that's all there is.\" Within the first few seconds, le it was at once apparent that he was on top form. We saw at once e his mastery of contrasting directions, of stage geometry, of rhythm and gesture; and each movement was made in a s completely different style. And the company performing in Brussels was, so evidently, absolutely groomed in Morris's style. One of the deepest pleasures of Morris's work in Brussels has been the extent to which it and the dancers have complimented each other. This illustrates what D Barry Alterman, the company's administrator, says about the en whole Brussels period; \"We were kids; now we're adult\"",

   "text_content" : "ROYAL ALDERT HALL/RADIO 3 The best of the foreign orchestras always tend to congregate at the end of the Promenade season. This year the last fortnight has brought three notable visitors: a disappoint- ing Orchestre de Paris, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and, in its first ever appearance at the Proms, the Dresden Staatskapelle, which gave two appreciable concerts. Tis is a most cultured orchestra. ThWre is nothing sh or glossy ab it, certainly s far as its brass sec concerned; bui Dresden acquires a beauty of its own fro he classical sense of proportion that informs all the orchestra's playing. There is an innate sense of how to balance and weight each p Ahat distin- ihesn o t the nobfl ; ris'easy t sed*iW it players 'A should want to work with the serene and serious conductor that Colin Davis has become. (Earlier this year Davis was awarded the title of Honorary Conductor in Dresden.) For there is an acceptance of the orchestra's accumulated wisdom in the deep, unhurried music-making that he now enjoys. Sunday's programme, which I heard on the radio, consisted of three symphonies. The most fascinating was Dvortk's Seventh Symphony, as; it was the antithesis of all that Mackerras had done with the same work at the Edinburgh Festival: where he had been all freshness and; sparkle, Davis ve Us es'tuha eworkha .' tbert's hadt perhaps forewarned us of what to expect. S Neither evening featured a c soloist, although Davis himself has a a fondness for singing along from h time to time. This can be a bit of a t] liability over the radio and seemed a i a good reason to catch the second r concert in the hall, which I did on a Monday. S The second programme was an S I all-German one, framed by the t1 contrasting styles of Mendelssohn and Reger. The evening opened in o i Fingal's Cave, on a day when its tl i waters were unusually placid. c i Reger's Variations and Fugue on a u Merry Theme by Johann Adam t Hiller was not quite that either, but e the piece did offer the opportunity s I fodhome genial and affectionate v p g of the kind that has become ii ai a mark of the mature Davis. c1 In 'between we had a sober i account of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. Davis no longer a captures in this music the feeling of as an energy impossible to repress, as m he did in his younger years. But a there was never any doubt that he ;d and his players were digging at the id roots of Beethoven interpretation to mn a degree that Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra failed to do on in Saturday, however marvellously ie they played. m In sum, two great orchestras out in of the three: Dresden representing ts the best of the old world with its d. classical elegance and deep a understanding of tradition, Boston m the confidence and technical at expertise of the new, no less ty splendid. If the Orchestre de Paris te wants to keep this sort of company ie in future, it will have to pull up its chaussettes. I Richard Fairman",

   "text_content" : "I AINDAo6uOii6ON, NEW YORK STATE In the Hudson Valley a second \"Rediscoveries\" Festival has just been mounted at Bard College, devoted this year to rediscovering Mendelssohn. As I reported on Sat- urday, clever programming - by the musicologist-conductor Leon Botstein and Sarah Rothenberg - aimed to illuminate forgotten aspects of that composer. (The inspiration came, I gather, from Roger Norrington's intensive \"weekends\".) If the leading exhibits were Botstein's own orchestral con- certs-with-voices, they were vastly enhanced by their provocative con- text. Not only solo and chamber recit- als planned to a sharp purpose, but apposite lectures with polemical points: Botstein on Mendelssohn's religious roots, Miss Rothenberg on his sister Fanny's great, thwarted talent, Bernard Jacobson on his relations with fellow-composers, William Little on the significance of the Bach revival which the young Mendelssohn crowned with his rediscovery of the \"St. Matthew\" I Passion. Apropos of that, for exam- t pie, the Emerson Quartet violinist Eugene Drucker played Bach's solo g D minor Chaconne and his G minor Sonata - coolly, meticulously - with redundant piano-supports by Mendelssohn (quirky and fascinat- ing) and later by his protegd Schu- mann (dull hack-stuff) to lubricate e the austere music for mid-19th-cen- tury ears. Though period instruments are s no part of the Bard Festival plan, an old wooden-frame piano would have V reproduced the original balance more truly than Diane Walsh's big modern Steinway. It might also have helped her to project more t character in two of Mendelssohn's 1 fine, Bach-inspired Preludes & Fugues, and in Brahms's virtuoso re-write of the G minor violin i Presto - but her self-effacing good s taste is anyhow not a virtuoso trait. She accompanied the baritone Wil- f liam Sharp to much better purpose g in his Goethe settings, matching s Mendelssohn's against Zelter and Schubert. As a Liedersdnrger of high i- intelligence and easy grace, Sharp t urgently awaits discovery on this o side of the Atlantic. r The pianist Todd Crow led a stir ring account of the B minor Quar- y tet, op. 3 - too loud by several degrees (the Steinway problem again), but taut and vital. Yet it was e Miss Rothenberg, no virtuoso but a passionate interpreter, who pro- vided the revelation of the second e Bard weekend with Fanny Mendels- i sohn's Das Jahr, published only e recently by a small German firm e dedicated to women composers' music. o This three-quarter-hour piano e cycle is a kind of diary of Fanny's s single liberated year in Italy (Rome k above all, but Venice too). It proves D to be no less cogently varied and . intricately imagined than, say, i Schumann's Davidsbindler set; it even looks forward to the discur- I- sive, freely dramatic cycles ol L Fibich and JanAcek. Its idiom is not g Mendelssohn-minus, but Mendels- i sohn-plus - the familiar, artful pia 2 nistic tropes and emotional excur- p sions beyond Felix's cultivated ter- s ritory. None of it sounds second-hand. r Far from shadowing her clever little a brother's music, Fanny's piano-writ- n ing might have been the broad s fount from which he drew his own a polished vein. More probably, the a siblings worked up their musical d idiom together, but the social con- straints of the time left room only for the brother to develop it in pub- y lic. Fanny might have been a semi- nist martyr; but Miss Rothenberg set out her plight judiciously, with- out axe-grinding, and then brought s Dos Jahr to life at the keyboard with passionately detailed sympa- e thy (if not the well-drilled fingers of d a 19th-century bourgeois daughter). She persuaded us that Das Jahr is ' no mere curio but a boldly assured creation, worthy to set against the ,f piano-music of her brother and t Schumann, to mutually illumina- ting effect.

   "text_content" : "OVER THE past two years, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, has walked a tightrope. His balancing act has been to keep rates high enough, for long enough, to puncture and deflate the Tokyo asset price \"bubble\"; but not so long as to force a sharp eco- nomic slowdown. So far it seems that he will achieve this remarkable feat. The Japanese government's task is to ensure that he does not have to do it again. Five discount rate increases between May 1989 and August 1990 have punctured Japan's \"bubble economy\". Stock prices fell sharply last year - the Nikkei index is now 42 per cent down on its peak at the beginning of 1990. The land market has been slower to respond, particularly in central Tokyo, causing the authorities to keep policy tight. Turnover has collapsed and many property speculators have gone bankrupt. Mean- while the collapse has shaken out a series of financial scan- dals which have rocked the Japanese financial community. So far the real Japanese economy has continued rela- tively unscathed, avoiding the dual threats of inflation or recession. But it is now begin- ning to slow. Property-related companies are suffering. Hous- ing starts fell 21 per cent in July; and bankruptcies were 63 per cent higher in the first seven months of the year, com- pared with the same period in 1990, mainly among property companies. Consumer spend- ing is also down, particularly on imported luxury goods. Yes- terday's news that seasonally adjusted private sector machin- ery orders fell by 1 per cent compared to a year ago sug- gests that corporate invest- ment is also beginning to slow. Plentiful capital A sharp fall in capital spend- ing is the main threat to eco- nomic growth. Business invest- ment accounted for 55 per cent of real economic growth since 1986, against a background of cheap and plentiful capital. All that has now changed. The Tokyo stock market has no appetite for new issues, while banks, struggling to meet internally agreed mini- mum capital-asset ratios, are unable to lend as before. Annual broad money growth, the counterpart to bank lend- ing, fell to a historically low rate of 3.4 per cent in July. So far companies have con- tinued to invest by drawing down their liquid cash reserves. They have inevitably reduced their spending plans too. The latest quarterly sur- vey from the Bank of Japan implies that capital spending will grow by 7.9 per cent in this fiscal year, down from 16.7 per cent in the last. Gradual slowdown The Bank has responded by easing policy. It cut the dis- count rate to 5.5 per cent in July; and last week injected liquidity into the market, caus- ing three-month interest rates to fall to 6.7 per cent from 7.1 per cent a week ago. Yet the evidence supports the Bank's expectation that there will be a gradual slow- down rather than a sharp decline. Growth is expected to slow to about 3 per cent in 1992, lower than in recent years, but still impressive by most standards. The Bank of Japan has room to ease policy further. The yen has strengthened against the dollar in recent months, easing inflationary pressures. Whole- sale prices rose by just 1.7 per cent in July compared with a year ago, and are expected to remain unchanged in August. Nevertheless, its priority must remain to ensure that a renewed bout of land price speculation does not begin once interest rates fall. High interest rates are a blunt way to offset the supply- side weaknesses which keep urban land prices so high. It is the combination of anachronis- tic zoning regulations, agricul- tural protectionism and a sys- tem of inheritance taxation that favours incumbent hold- ers of agricultural land that is to blame. The obvious and preferable solution would be for the rul- ing Liberal Democratic party to put financial stability, and the interests of consumers, before those of the farm lobby which has been dominant for over four decades. The LDP is in a stronger position to act than ever before. Mr Mieno has acted, and acted well. It is time his political masters followed his example.",

   "text_content" : "THE COLLAPSE of the Keith Prowse group has rocked the UK corporate hospitality indus- try. It was the largest company in the Â£500m a year business, and official agent for the Wimbledon tennis champion- ships and Lords test matches. Like the industry itself, Keith Prowse had experienced a decade of explosive growth. This growth might appear unexpected at a time when tax cuts and rising executive incomes have initiated a trend away from perks and benefits, yet corporate hospitality has proved to be a cost-effective form of marketing. International trading compa- nies have long known that entertaining clients is a neces- sary part of doing business in Japan and the Middle East. But it is increasingly part of the marketing armoury elsewhere. A survey in October 1990 found that eight out of 10 UK compa- nies rated the relatively small amounts they spent on corpo- rate hospitality as more effec- tive than advertising, exhibi- tins and direct mail There are dangers in the practice, which can easily be portrayed as a form of bribery. With avenge expenditure per event under 2200 a head, the moral hasrd is probably low. But mch larger expenditure is not unknown, and wise employers will take steps to avoid undue pressures on employees through a policy of dslog significant treats. A 1 company like Sainsbury, D whose directors routinely i refuse all invitations, places v itself above suspicion. I, It may just be that the e greater damage is done to the event which hosts the enter- tainment. Complaints that phi. listine businessmen with I mobile telephones are drown- . ing out the Mozart at Glynde- r bourne are exaggerated. But i the success of this year's a unscheduled Sunday session at I Wimbledon - at which any i, corporate spectators were B spending only their own a money - indicates that some- thing can be lost from great occasions when the hospitality t marquees are erected. Admitting Mammon to sport- 1 ing and cultural events can t certainly raise significant sums of money. Companies which . sponsor institutions such as I the Royal Opera House or events such as test matches I are entitled to be rewarded for their philanthropy with tickets for their staff and customers. And if the wealthier busi- ness customers are coralled in a high-priced corporate ghetto - as at Wimbledon - the trickle-down effect may oper- r ate for ordinary spectators who a can still buy reasonably-priced . tickets through the draw. How- 5 ever, a sensible promoter will a limit the seats allocated to cor- > porate hospitality, and wring i the maximum revenue by auc- f tioning the rights to them to L the highest bidders.",

   "text_content" : "Robert Taylor explains why Sweden's Social Democrats may face general election defeat his Sunday's general election in Sweden may mark the end of a political era, as the Social Democratic party that has ruled the country for all but sit of the past 59 years goes down to defeat. The public opinion polls all point to a victory for the five non-socialist par- ties - though whether they will remain united enough to establish a viable coalition government that stays the course of a three-year parlia- ment must remain in doubt. If the Social Democrats do lose, it will be a historic reversal The party has, after all, been virtually synony- mous with Sweden for decades; in the eyes of its admirers it is the most successful democratic party in the world. Now - although it will remain by far the largest party in parliament and will continue to influence Sweden from opposition - it is set to be replaced by a government that may have fewer inhibitions about exposing the country to untrammelled market forces. Social democracy as Sweden once knew it has in any case been dying for some time. The party has been forced to stage a strategic withdrawal during the 1980s in the face of enor- mous economic and social changes that are transforming the Swedish Model into a western European mar- ket economy. Over the past three years under Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson it has moved a long way to come to terms with Swedes' demands for more individual freedom and the internationalisation of the economy. In one policy area after another - agriculture, retail distribution, priva- tisation of state-controlled industry, competition and anti-monopoly laws - the Social Democrats bowed to the market and began to pull down the panoply of controls and regulation that protected much of the economy since the early 1940s. The removal of foreign exchange controls in July 1989 coupled with this summer's decision to link the krona to the European Currency Unit as a step towards membership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System has ensured that the country can no lon- ger devalue to improve industrial competitiveness. Party leaders have also questioned openly many of the old Social Demo- cratic shibboleths. They accepted that the conquest of inflation should be a higher priority than the maintenance of full employment and acknowledged that public expenditure must be reduced as a proportion of gross national product to much less than its current 57 per cent. And in its 1991-1992 tax reforms, the party accepted that the tax burden must be shifted off incomes and on to goods and services as an incentive for The way it was: Ingvar Carlsson victorious In 1988 appears set for defeat on Sunday at the hands of Carl Bldt, right \"'a: iÂ·Â· - ;, Â·Â·:.~i:i.Â·i:Â·Â·Â·.- ..Â·Â·~ people to work. This was a significant break with traditional social democ- racy - indeed, ministers admitted it had its roots in Reaganomics. Under their finance minister Allan Larsson the Social Democrats also fol- lowed a prudent and responsible financial policy. There has been no pre-election spending spree even though the country is in the depths of a recession - a fact which seems to have impressed the money markets more than the electorate. The Social Democrats' foreign pol- icy has been no less malleable. Swe- den's traditional neutrality - always t a somewhat flexible concept in any case - is no longer seen as a barrier t to western European integration in the aftermath of the Cold War. This 1 July Mr Carlsson presented his coun- try's application for European Com- e munity membership with his party's > full support. i The fundamental revision of Swed- f ish social democracy has come as a ) shock to many non-socialists who s accused the party of stealing many of their own best electoral clothes. It has been even more confusing for the party faithful. s To the electorate at large, social democracy is showing signs of intel- lectual exhaustion. The party's elec- tion manifesto is almost devoid of ideas, consisting mainly of a paean to the past. To its many critics, the party now lacks the vitality and cohesion to dictate the agenda of Swedish poli- tics. From the 1930s onwards the Social Democrats won the battle of ideas. The party combined administrative competence with an idealistic vision. Unlike democratic left-wing parties elsewhere, it avoided bitter schisms and was able to absorb other political movements that might have threat-",

   "text_content" : "M r Carl Bildt, 42-year-old leader of the Moderate party, believes he will be Sweden's next prime minister after Sunday's election, at the head of a non-socialist coalition government. If he is right, he will become the first conservative prime minister the country has had since 1930. Elected to lead the party in August 1986 at the age of 37, he owed his rapid rise to the top in Swedish poli- tics to his braising parliamentary battles over foreign and defence pol- icy with the late Olof Palme. The former prime minister once accused Mr Bildt of being a \"security risk\" after he briefed the US State Depart- ment on Soviet submarine incursions into Swedish waters. The charge did him no harm in Moderate circles. In fact, Mr Bildt - fluent in English and German - is probably the most knowledgeable politician in Sweden about international relations. He is on close personal terms with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and is a friend of Chris Patten, the British Conservative party chairman. Since his election to parliament on the Stockholm list in 1979, Mr Bildt has made the place of Sweden in the world his primary interest Indeed, it he has been a fervent supporter of *i Swedish European Community mem- 1- bership since he was at university in T the early 1970s. - It is this commitment which gives ie Mr Bildt's politics logic and coher- d ence. \"Europe has become the symbol Ã½\" of hope for the regeneration of Swe- t- den - from food policy to taxation, is from culture to the environment,\" he d asserts. To Mr Bildt his country's move into the EC signifies a clear n break with the old notion of Sweden Ly as a middle way, a country balanced n ideologically between east and west. s. He believes Sweden's convergence *I with the EC will render much of the y country's collectivist ideology obso- me lete. While Ingvar Carlsson often a. gives the impression he wants to a Swedify Europe, Mr Bildt is seeking It the opposite. ie In his view the domestic agenda of I, the Moderate party will turn Sweden ,f into a country fit for EC membership. i- Mr Bildt wants to cut the heavy tax n burden, privatise state industry, abol. ish the public wage-earner funds, s stimulate freedom of choice in the r- welfare system and encourage the )1 work ethic, personal saving and e- small businesses. Only by carrying i, through a more robust market strat- ie egy, he reasons, can Sweden enjoy a 's competitive advantage when it enters Ir the EC - a move which may come as n soon as January 11995. d Although the Social Democrats love to caricature Mr Bildt as a e Thatcherite figure hell-bent on ie destroying the welfare state and a- creating mass unemployment, he is a n conservative much more in the mould :o of Edward Heath than of Margaret g Thatcher. But in a political system that thrives on consensus he can be >f seen as a divisive figure. The sociable Len Mr Carlsson cannot disguise his dis- ip. taste for Mr Bildt. tax But the tall, donnish young man ol- will not enjoy complete political fkee- ds, dom to do what he likes if the Social the Democrats lose on Sunday. His own the party can expect to poll only about ad 20-22 per cent of the national vote. Ing He must build a broad coalition of at- non-socialist parties to ensure a r a majority government - and that will ers not be easy. He has good relations as with Liberal leader Bengt Wester- berg. The two men have agreed on a ats common economic programme - ia which they have called New Start for on Sweden - aimed at opening the econ- Lnd omy to market forces. s a To ensure a viable government mld they also need the backing of the ret Christian Democrats - a small party em set to enter parliament for the first be time - and more problematically the ble unpredictable and left-leaning Centre ened its dominance, such as the anti- nuclear campaign. Now it is the non-socialist parties that have the initiative and the Social Democrats who are reacting to pres- sures and influences over which they have little control. Over the past three years, Mr Carls- son has fought a rearguard action to bolster his support through tactical alliances with the Liberals or the Cen- tre party. But this does not seem to have been enough to convince the voters that the Social Democrats remain the party best able to govern Sweden as the country negotiates its way into the European Community - which it hopes to do by the end of 1994. Mr Carlsson's problem in essence is that he finds it difficult to explain the sort of market socialism which he has sought to introduce to Sweden. Instead, he has reverted to traditional Social Democratic messages about the need to protect the old, the young and the sick through state support. He warns that the Moderates, the main opposition party whose leader may be the next prime minister (see below), want to import Thatcherism into Swe- den. His basic electoral message - a mixture of scare-mongering and nos- talgic appeal - does not seem to have found an echo among many voters, particularly the younger generation who will vote heavily for the non-so- cialist parties. Mr Carlsson's position has not been helped by Sweden's economic perfor- mance. True, its inflation rate - vir- tually zero on a month-on-month basis - is now among the lowest in western Europe, thanks to a surpris- ingly successful voluntary wage restraint policy; it is also showing a comfortable visible trade surplus. But the economy is expected to show little or no growth between 1990 and 1992; industrial production has plummeted this year; and the balance of pay- ments deficit has increased substan- tially. Most people's living standards may have have been unaffected but there is still widespread discontent. Regis- tered unemployment has risen to over - 3.1 per cent of the workforce and is - set to climb to 4 per cent or more next r year. This may be modest by western i European standards but it alarms r many Swedes who have grown up i with full employment. Small wonder that the electorate hankers after change - even if it I looks set to produce a weak, divided . coalition with little ideological glue to bind it. It is Sweden's misfortune that . this is likely to be the result at a time I when the country needs a strong gov- i ernment to negotiate the best terms I for EC membership and to pull the - economy out of the doldrums. party whose leader Mr Olof Johans- son is already laying down in public terms for joining a Bildt coalition. Adding to the probable post-elec- tion confusion the recently formed populist New Democracy also looks set to enter parliament. If it secures enough seats to hold the balance of power and to stop the other four non- Socialist parties achieving a majority between them, Mr Bildt might find it hard to keep his putative coalition in line. The Liberal leader has warned that his party would refuse to join a non-socialist coalition that depended on ND for parliamentary survival Mr Bildt has never held senior office before. A dry, often sharp-spo- ken man, it is questionable whether he has the diplomatic skdlls to keep his coalition partners content. But nobody should doubt his abilities, or his single-mindedness. The Moderate leader knows he is playing for high stakes this weekend. If he succeeds in forming a govern- ment he could lead Sweden into the EC and start to wean his country away from Social Democratic atti- tudes. But if he falls he could set back the cause of conservatism in Sweden for another generation.",

   "article_dc_title" : "A 12-month Turnaround for the Unemployed",
   "text_content" : "By Richard Layard and John Philpott does it really have to be so high? We cannot avoid some short-term unemployment. But there will soon be nearly 1m Britons who have been out of work for more than a year. Long-term unemployment does almost nothing to control infla- tion. People who are out of work for more than a year are four times less likely to find work than the newly-unemployed. They become demoralised and lose their habit of work. Employers are loath to risk employing them, so that they cease to be a part of the effec- tive supply of labour. This is a human tragedy, and an economic disaster. An effi- cient society prevents long-term unemployment. Yet almost by mistake we have a system which directly causes it. Our unemployment benefits, though mean, last indefinitely, which makes it possible to survive indefinitely on benefits. At the same time, we do very little to help the unemployed find work or improve their skils. This is the Meact ofnprie of what Beveridge intended. He believed that unconditional benefit should be paid for a limited period. After that, state assistance should be In the form of training or work. We theforere need a new contrat between the staet am the citizen. The duty of the the chan- lor, Nor- n Lamont, s said, employ- nt is a ce we pay controlling ation. But i- state should be to ensure that - within a year of becoming t, unemployed every individual I, has offers of training and/or * work. And the duty of the citi- a zen should be to accept one of y a number of reasonable offers. g This general principle is it such common sense that any o fair-minded person should e surely accept it. But how it exactly would it be applied? a It could not be introduced if overnight But that is inevita- .. ble. We should build a system s that can survive the economic i- cycle and we should stop living from one expedient to another. k The following structure r could be established within the k life of a parliament I. * Each Jobcentre would have d the duty to secure offers of E. work or high-quality training k within 12 months for every y unemployed person. * Each unemployed person would have a personal place- d ment officer equipped with i- on-line information about all s vacancies in the country.

It * After slx months, if the per t son was still unemployed and t needed to be trained or Y retrained, he or she would be sent on a high-quair y training B conne - nomlly llItem - r leading to a recogalmed qualif- ation. cal employers would I contrel these cours and col- e lectively aim (or even guaran- I tee) to employ alB ceasftul I students.

Any employer hiring a person from this club would get a Â£1,000 subsidy. * As a last resort, anyone still unemployed after 12 months would be offered a proper six- month job at a regular work- place, paid at the rate for the job. Hospitals, social services, public works departments or voluntary organisations would be the main employers. * All the money to finance these activities should be routed through the Jobcentres, which would then buy the most cost-effective deal for their clients. This plan would, of course, cost money. But it would also save money. When someone is unemployed, the nation typi- cally loses Â£20,000 a year. The taxpayers lose Â£8,000, the unemployed person Â£5,000, and companies lon the rest. So if we could eliminate half a million long-term unem- ployed, we could save the nation lObn a year and save the eachequer bn. This could be achieved within five years at a cost to the exchequer of less than Slbn yea. What a bargain.

But little has happened in the UK. One problem comes from our system of departmental respon- sibilities. If the Department of Employment's programmes save money on benefits, those savings go to the Department of Social Security. The answer here is simple: put benefits under the Employment Depart- ment (Just as Jobcentres and benefit offices are together). All these changes will take time. In the first years, while recession persists, they will be hard going. And they will be far more effective if accompan- led by wage-bargaining reform, making possible a more buoy- ant economy. But the key decision is one of principle - to have a system which prevents long-term unemployment.

The English Institute's Recommendation N15 in 1952 stated: \"The pri- mary purpose of the annual accounts of a business is to present information to the pro- prietors showing how their funds have been utilised and the profits derived from such use.\" This suggests that it may be desirable for UK financial accounts to move back towards a stricter use of historical cost, in line with US practice. Even the Sandilands Com- mittee, which recommended Current Cost Accounting in 1975 under the influence of political pressures, noted (para. 273) that historical cost accounting \"has proved to be of great value in protecting the i. interests of shareholders and le creditors of companies and, te when price are stable, results ir- in a clear and unambiguous n- view of a company's affairs\". ih Indeed, subject always to the in phrase \"when prices are sta- 1r- ble\", Sandilands identified al many advantages of historical to cost accounting: versatility, o- usefulness, verifiability, free- ir dom from ambiguity, prudence, id comparability between compa- ih nies and over time, intelligibil- Ly ity and cheapness. al During its extended trial Is period Current Cost Account- t, ing proved both unpopular and unworkable.

And in the same lecture he warned that \"of all the nationalist movements in Europe today none is more vio- lent or more likely to cause a revolution than the Croat national movement in Yugo- slavia\", going on to point out that Serbs and Croats are divided not by language but by alphabet and spiritual alle- giance. \"And behind that we find the epoch-making decision of the Emperor Diocletian in AD 285 to divide the Roman Empire, for the line between the Churches still approxi- mates very closely to this line of seventeen hundred years ago.\"* He began the lecture by pointing out that there is noth- ing new about national feelings or the sentiment of patriotism, and quoted lyrical passages about Italy from Dante and Petrarch. But, he went on, \"it never crossed the mind of either Dante or Petrarch that Italy might be united to form a single independent state\".

What intense pleasure he would take in explaining the uanba5InuuI LU speare alongside Dante and Petrarch as part of the long pedigree of patriotism, he could not say that it \"never crossed the mind\" of Shake- speare that England could form a single independent state, since in his time it already did; and moreover the very lines he quoted from Shakespeare's Richard II directly associate patriotism with the state: \"This royal throne of Kings, this sceptred isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars...\" This is even more true of British patriotism. One can, if one tries, think of England as essentially a place. But it is very difficult to think of Britain as anything except a state, and an imperial state at that. \"Great Britain\" was origi- nally a geographical expres- sion, distinguishing la grande Bretagne from the other Bre- tagne across the Channel, or possibly the largest of the Brit- ish Isles from the next largest, After 1967, Britain became 'a polity at last adapting to the problem of efficiently governing itself, rather than other people' better known as Ireland. But in ordinary language today \"Britain\" is synonymous with the United Kingdom, and most people seem to think, or assume without thinking, that it was called Great in reference to its power and status in the world. Was that not implied in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election slogan, \"Britain is Great Again\"? Thus the British national identity is intimately bound up with the idea of Britain as a state, and even as a great impe- rial power. This point is vividly illuminated in two books by British historians published this month: The Pursuit of Greatness, by Robert Holland (Fontana, Â£6.99), and Britannia Overruled, by David Reynolds (Longman, Â£26.00). Both are essentially histories of British foreign policy in the 20th cen- tury, and both take as their main focus the effort devoted by Britain's governing elite to maiintaing the country's sta- tus as a great power, at a time when its power was, in fact, bound to decline because, as Mr Reynolds puts it, \"power is not a possession but a relation- ship\". Britain was uniquely power- ful in the mid to late 19th cen- tury not so much because of its intrinsic strength as because it had no global rivals, while in Europe there was \"a temporary equilibrium\". Even then, Britain was not a great mili- tary (as opposed to naval) power, and Bismarck could say that \"if the British army landed on the German coast he would send the local police force to arrest it\". Historically, Britain had always relied on allies and coalitions to achieve its foreign policy goals, and in the 20th century, with the rise of new world powers and new technologies of war (especially air power) this became more and more necessary. Europe as a whole has lost power dramat- ically compared to the rest of the world, and states in gen- eral seem to be less powerful than they were, as \"the trans- national economy has gouged deep into the body politic\". For individual British peo- ple, loss of power has hardly been a disaster. \"Being power- ful may be desirable,\" observes Mr Reynolds; \"being alive is surely more important. View- ing the century as a whole, Germany's 'rise' has been a good deal more unpleasant for the average German than Britain's 'decline' has been for the ordinary Briton\". But for the British dlite this has been peculiarly difficult to accept. That is the theme of Mr Hol- land's book: that from the Edwardian period onwards the ruling class became obsessed with \"a vision of national greatness on which the legiti- macy of the status quo had come to depend\". As an extreme example he quotes Evelyn Shuckburgh, private secretary to the then Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, con- siding to his diary in 1953: \"I ended today extremely gloomy about British prospects every- where...I see no reason why there should be any end to the surrenders demanded of us. International law and the tem- per of international opinion is all set against the things which made us a great nation, i.e. our activities outside our own ter- ritory. Bit by bit we shall be driven back into our island where we shall starve.\" Mr Holland ends his narra- tive in 1970, arguing that the collapse of sterling in 1967 and the adjustments that followed it, including the withdrawal from \"east of Suez\", marked the abandonment of the \"pur- suit of greatness\" by \"a polity at last adapting to the problem of efficiently governing itself, rather than other people\". But Mr Reynolds, more percep- tively I fear, sees the story as still continuing. Britain, he notes, has special difficulties in adapting to a world where nation-states are downgraded because the continuity of the state and political institutions - \"the Crown in Parliament\" - is much more central to British national identity than to that of other European nations, whose national cul- tures have survived long peri- ods of political disunity and/or institutional discontinuity. What is Britain, if not a state? An island which the English share with the Scots and the Welsh? It was the state that bound the three nations together in one. English people use \"British\" and \"English\" as almost interchangeable terms, without thinking about it. Scots and Welsh retained a separate national conscious- ness, while participating in a highly-successful state enter- prise known as Great Britain. For them, as for other Euro- pean nations, it is no problem to retain the same national consciousness while participat- ing in another enterprise, which in the new circum- stances has more to offer, called Europe. But the English have more difficulty in detach- ing their national feelings from the sovereignty of the British state. * The lecture is reprinted in His- tory and Idealism (John Mur- ray, Â£15.95), a collection of Rob- ert Birley'sessays, addresses and letters published last year by his son-in-law Brian Rees.",

   "text_content" : "WHAT started as Georgia's bold crusade for independence from the Soviet Union now has all the elements of a tragic farce: the president is raging in his palace about a ubiquitous KGB threat, the for- mer prime minister has gone into oppo- sition with the rebel National Guard, while the republic's capital hosts its first international juggling festival. President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a for- mer dissident and fervent Georgian nationalist, has needed all the skills of a juggler to stay in power as his author- itarian tendencies clash with the popu- lar mandate he received in elections last May. His critics say he has suppressed the republic's opposition and ethnic minori- ties. At the same time he has been accused of going along with the failed coup against President Mikhail Gorba- chev. Mr Gamsakhurdia, in turn, has alleged that a former commander of the Georgian National Guard was involved in a military plot against the Georgian 3Id government and he has now ordered ice the force to be disbanded. The failure of *w the coup and the dismantling of com- ce: munist central government - which Mr ice Gamsakhurdia had fought so arduously or- - also removed much of the justifica- p0- tion for Georgians to unite around himl/ d, and to overlook his dictatorial paranoia. its Things went from bad to worse when Mr Gamsakhurdia's own security forces or- opened fire on unarmed protesters on an September 2. Since then, small crowds of of protesters have rallied every night or- outside the parliament building u- shouting \"Ceausescu\", \"Fascist\" and ins \"Blood drinker\". Previously divided opposition groups, he now enjoying the tacit support of the ri- National Guard, are calling for the pres- en ident's resignation and fresh elections. ed \"He wants to create a closed dictato- )a- rial state like Albania (was), in which as he would rule supreme,\" says Mr Ten- he giz Sigua, who was Georgia's prime ed minister until he resigned four days an before the coup attempt in protest d against a lack of democracy and of mar- If ket reform. Mr Sigua, unshaven and i- tieless but still distinguished in a pin- [r striped suit, took refuge at National r Guard headquarters five days ago to i- escape arrest by Mr Gamsakhurdia. p/ But Mr Gamsakhurdia, himself holed i. up in offices guarded by a few hundred n loyal troops and policemen, said yester- s day that he had come under attack as a part of a KGB plot led by Mr Eduard a Shevardnadze, the former Soviet for- It eign minister who used to rule Georgia, g assisted by President Gorbachev (whom d he \"revealed\" to be a KGB general). i. he president said they were e assisted in their efforts to over- I- throw him by 40,000 KGB agents in Georgia - who happened to include all opposition leaders. t He said the move to disband the National Guard was taken to save it e from annihilation by the Soviet army. s But he contradicted this by saying it t was also part of a reorganisation which b had been planned long before the coup, I even though he cancelled the decision - when the coup collapsed. i Accusing Mr Gamsakhurdia of doing the bidding of coup leaders in Moscow, Mr Tengla Kitovani, the former artist I who commands the National Guard, I took to the hills with his men the day - after the coup was launched on August i 19. He is now back at his headquarters I waiting for \"the politicians to sort out the problems\". Dressed in a track suit, with a pistol tucked in his waist, Mr Kitovani says his aim is to defend Geor- gia against those who oppose democ- racy - in this case the president. i Given the large degree of popular support he still enjoys, Mr Gamsakhur- I dia could cling to power for some time to come. But his record is unlikely to win international recognition of Geor- gian independence, which he so desper- ately wants. His failure to conduct eco- nomic reform seems likely to inflict increased hardship on ordinary people k whose trust in him was once total",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd and Mark Nicholson in Moscow WESTERN foreign ministers yesterday called for European states to have the power to intervene in the internal con- flicts of eastern Europe, using the present strife in Yugoslavia and gathering conflicts in the former Soviet Union to illus- trate their concern. Their proposals, still in out- line form, came as Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, signalled an easing of Wash- ington's position on assistance to the Soviet Union. As aid to the Soviets continued to occupy centre-stage, Soviet President Mikail Gorbachev, in a strong speech to the Confer- ence on Security and Co-opera- tion in Europe which opened in Moscow, warned against erect- ing a new barrier in Europe, \"an economic curtain which would divide the continent into the rich and the poor\". Mr Gorbachev said that \"the international community will now deal with a union of sover- eign states, a country where free, democratic republics, and dozens of ethnic groups, coex- ist voluntarily and equally\". He said that the rights of minorities must be protected. \"If Europe wishes to avoid a flood of refugees and inter-eth- nic hatreds ... it must make sure minority rights are pro- tected across the continent. Otherwise, the entire CSCE process will collapse, burying human rights under its rub- ble,\" he warned. As he spoke, some ethnic groups in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova were engaged in barely suppressed hostilities - a matter referred S I Soviet break-up.............Page 2 SLiberal Democrats ........Page 8 Soviet orile keeps mlrkets Sguessing.....................Page 30 to by several foreign ministers attending the conference. Mr Gorbachev also made s clear that he wanted urgent , humanitarian and longer term aid from the west. \"We need D assistance, co-operation, soli- ) darity,\" he said. \"There are now conditions t for more speedy and resolute i implementation of the Group of Seven agreements, for assist- ing the republics and the union i to restore the economy.\" Mr Baker, speaking as he set out on a visit to Moscow, said a that a Soviet commitment to economic reform - not actual implementation of reforms - i would be enough to open the I door to direct US aid. The strongest proposal from western foreign ministers, for I the CSCE countries to consider - developing something such as an anti-totalitarian task force, f came from Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign I minister. He said that last month's abortive coup in the Soviet Union had taught other - states that they must immedi- ately isolate would-be put- schists and deal only with I recognised authorities. The CSCE had a responsibil- ity to underpin its ideals on : human rights by deploying observers in countries which had fallen victim to a coup, or I which suppressed human I rights - even where permis- I* Pensive: Douglas Hurd at the conference yesterday.

Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said Britain backed these \"far-reaching\" proposals. He said: \"We are certainly in favour of moving beyond the present situation where everything (in the CSCE) happens by consensus.\" Yugoslavia had \"shown the limited value\" of CSCE mecha- nisms, where central authority had failed, he said. Other foreign ministers, though less explicit, voiced concern over the observation of human rights in the frag- menting Soviet republics. The three Baltic states, Lat- via, Lithuanian and Estonia, were yesterday formally accepted as full individual members of the CSCE. Throughout the day, the ministers were shuttled into meetings with Mr Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Rus- sian president, in a demonstra- tion of the dual presidential power which now sustains the Soviet Union. The meeting were dominated by discussions about foreign aid.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay and Allson Smith LABOUR yesterday signalled a significant tactical shift in its attacks on Tory economic poli- cies by warning that Britain now faces a return to a short- lived boom fuelled by con- sumer credit, set to be followed by a new downturn. The warnings - the first tacit acceptance by the main opposition party that recovery may be under way - came as the Liberal Democrats opened their own onslaught on govern- ment \"short-termism\" at their conference in Bournemouth. Evidence of the impact of improving economic indicators on the pre-election manoeu- vring came in speeches by Mr Nell Kinnock, the Labour leader, and the party's treasury spokesman, Mrs Margaret Beckett. Both avoided chal- lenging government claims that a recovery is in sight, pmr frring to.predict a uturn to the boomand-burt cyde. The Liberal Democrats' con- ference approved a package of Â· UarN Dwnoorf . nmlar M reper.......Page 6 radical measures in what I amounts to its first comprehen- sive economic policy. t Refusing to comment on his I likely tactics in the event of a r hung parliament, Mr Paddy I Ashdown, the party leader, I instead tried to shift the spot- light to the package which he r claims represents a significant advance in the party's eco- f nomic credibility. I Among the measures are * efforts to limit politicians' r involvement in economic ded- r sions, decentralised pay bar- r gaining and an independent t central bank, a tough competi- - tion policy, the setting of a i national savings target and swift movement towards a sin- gle European currency. Mr Alan Blth, the party's treasury spokesman, said that f under the Tories the economic debate had been reduced to a single question: \"When will it end?\", and described Mr Nor- man Lamont, the chancellor, as being in \"waiting-for-Father Christmas mode\". Labour's conversion to free enterprise was \"dictated by events rather than beliefs\", he said. To head-off Liberal Democrat incursions into the Tory vote MIr Chris Patten, the Conserva- tive party chairman, used a speech in Southampton to accuse the party of being ready to barter their votes \"in return for a few crumbs from Labour's cabinet table\". In Bournemouth, the party leadership shrugged off a com- ment from Dr David Owen. The former leader of the defunct Social Democratic party said he was \"highly unlikely\" to vote for the lib- eral Democrats, which was formed after he reufsed to join some of his S DP co es merging with the Lib after tIe 17 etertion.",

   "text_content" : "By Clive Cookson, Science Editor AT LAST urban gardeners have a scientific excuse for being less green-fingered than their country cousins. Green- fly and other aphids find plants far more appealing if they grow in polluted air. UK scientists have shown that aphid infestation can be four times as serious in plants and trees growing in moderate levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone - pollutant levels frequently experienced in urban and industrial areas of Europe and North America - than in iden- tical plants growing in clean air. The aphid studies at Lancas- ter University and Imperial College, London, are part of a ilm research programme into the effects of air pollution on crops and forests, financed Jointly by the Natural Envi- ronment Research Council (NERC) and the UK electricity supply industry. The results, announced in London yesterday, suggest that insect damage intensified by air pollution may be an important factor in the myste- rious malady which has affected forests in several industrial countries during the last 20 years. \"Aphids seem to thriv-e when exposed to sulphur diox- ide, nitrogen dioxide or ozone,\" NERC said yesterday. \"They are generally healthier and put on weight, which results in their multiplying faster, causing an increase in the size and frequency of pest outbreaks.\" The explanation, according to Dr Roger Moore of Lancas- ter University, is that pollut- ant gases change the biochemi- cal balance of the sap In the plants and make their growing shoots more attractive to aphids. \"Pollated plants are a better source of food,\" he sid \"The damage to the plants i\" invisible but the aphids quickly respond to it\" The most detailed studies have been done on spruce, an important coaifer for commer- =1s forestry, which is highly susceptible to aphid attack. Tens of thousands of the insects can feed off a single tree and defoliate all its nee- dies.

   "text_content" : "Two successive days of drift in UK share prices reflect eco- nomic confusion as much as political jumpiness. Most of the recent indicators - business confidence, retail sales and yesterday's encouraging output prices - seem to be moving in the right direction. By contrast, with the Sep- tember reporting season now well under way, there is pre- cious little confirmation from companies that the recovery is being felt where it really mat- ters. Add to this the prospect of more jumbo rights issues and it is easy to see why insti- tutions may be turning cau- tious. In July (the last month for which figures are available) they put almost twice as much money into gilts as in the first six months of the year com- bined. Beazer The extent to which Mr Bea- zer is working for the banks will doubtless become clearer with publication of the CHB pathfinder prospectus today. Yesterday's statement, though, indicates that the price of a four-year reprieve includes the bulk of proceeds from the sale of the UK housebuilding and other property and construc- tion assets as well as tight con- trol over the dividend purse strings. Few UK investors who backed Beazer in the 1980s are likely to place their faith in the company's obviously rosy view of US infrastructure spending in the 1990s. Their confidence will hardly be bolstered by a reading of the valedictory profit and loss account. It is no doubt coincidence that the net exceptional items - including a fair value release equivalent to 25 per cent of pre-tax profits - are substantially positive, while the net extraordinaries are heavily negative. Arjo Wiggins Arjo Wiggins Appleton's interim results were greeted by a 6 per cent fall in its shares, but that has to be be seen against a near 50 per cent out- performance since Wiggins Teape was floated just over a year ago. Given that the shares have been valued on hopes for eventual faster growth from the merged companies, talk of a second half slowdown was slightly unnerving. AJA has joined the likes of Reckitt & Colman and Burmah Castrol in that the operational benefits of takeover or merger have been postponed or reduced by the FT-SE Index: 2,830. (-224) Delta Share price relative to the FT-A AU-Share Index 150 140 120 110 1987 88 89 90 91 soure: atmtreem recession, leaving the compa- nies reliant on cost-cutting for the moment. All the same, it is hard to ignore the 12 per cent increase in interim operating profits from AWA's paper manufactur- ing business, and the 1 per cent increase in group operat- ing margins. Appleton in the US grew its operating profit by 27 per cent, benefiting from Boise Cas- cade's withdrawal from carbon- less paper. Management has not made any obvious false moves. It all suggests that if expen- sive problem areas such as eucalyptus pulp manufacturing in Spain and the minority interest in a Portuguese pulp mill can be resolved, the group will be able to Justify its initial hopes for the merger. News that Soporcel in Portugal is once again close to disposal might counter yesterday's dis- appointment a little. Assuming Â£250m this year, the shares are on a multiple just below the market average; that seems about right. Delta Delta's 28 per cent first half profits reverse looks like an alpha performance relative to others of its engineering ilk - but the market took a dis- tinctly gamma-minus view of its merely maintained interim dividend. That is unfair. A likely year-end cover of two times or better obviously offers scope to be more gener- ous - but it is surely wiser to take that decision in early 1992 when there should be tangible signs of recovery in its main businesses, rather than now when there are virtually none. Far from being criticised for miserliness, Delta should be applauded for the sort of pru- dence that has been conspicu- ous by its absence in other boardrooms. The good news from yester- day's statement is that this year's drastic volume reduc- tions - in some product areas as much as 40 per cent - have at least come to a halt. Costs have been attacked - with 20 per cent of the workforce dis- appearing in two and a half years - so there is a genuine operational gearing dimension. The question is how quickly volumes will recover and how far margins will be rebuilt in the light of aggressive pricing from the likes of the privatised electricity companies. There is a solid core of insti- tutional support for the shares, but with full-year profits unlikely to be much more than double the first six months,the upside looks limited for the moment. Tangible evidence to justify the rating or an inspired acquisition in Europe or the US would help. Water sector The government's attempts to shed the UK's image as the dirty man of Europe are hav- ing a curious effect in the water sector. Thanks to the so-called Patten proposals (which in March last year pre- empted the more embarrassing bits of the EC waste water directive) and to a deal made a few months later by the gov- ernment to avoid prosecution for foul beaches, the water industry is under pressure to accelerate its capital spending programme. However, the burden falls very unevenly across the sec- tor, mainly on South West Water and Southern Water. The imbalance could yet affect the wider debate on price set- ting in the water industry. So far, Southern has dragged its feet, but South West has said it intends bringing forward expensive improvements to its long sea waste outfalls. It will be spending up to Â£320m extra this year, equivalent to 40 per cent of its entire capital pro- gramme to 1995. It could find the money by postponing other projects, but is expected instead to ask per- mission from the regulator to pass on the extra costs to its customers in the form of higher prices. Ofwat will be reviewing South West's appli- cation while it is simulta- neously bearing down on the prices of companies such as Welsh and Severn Trent. If even one of those companies tries to tough it out, the regu- latory regime will face its big- gest test.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London NATIONAL Westminster Bank launched a Â£140m preference share issue after the close of trad- ing last night, bolstering its core capital and capacity to lend. The second largest UK clearing bank has picked Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank recently dropped by the British Treasury from the Â£5bn British Telecom share issue, to run the issue rather than County NatWest, its merchant banking subsidiary. The issue follows National Westminster's interim results announced last month, which showed a pre-tax profit of Â£101m after record bad debt provisions of Â£902m. The issue, strongly rumoured during trading hours yesterday, was taken as a sign that the bank will not make a rights issue in the near future. The shares were unchanged yes- terday, against a background of falling prices in the sector. While National Westminster remains well-capitalised by international standards, it is keen to build cap- ital resources wherever possible to allow for future asset growth. Despite the thirst for new capi- tal, few banks have issued ster- ling preference shares because the cost of capital is seen as high. s- The only issues still held by i investors are two Â£100m deals ie launched by Bank of Scotland in is November last year and in 1988. l Preference shares pay a fixed p- annual interest rate like debt Le securities but are subordinated t. almost to the level of equity. The 1- shares issued yesterday pay a 12 r- per cent coupon and are priced to e yield 2.5 per cent more than long- L dated UK government bonds. by The issue of irredeemable, non- LI8 cumulative preference shares will in count as Tier I capital under the . Basle accord on international ed bank capital adequacy. The bt accord requires international ed banks to achieve a minimum he capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per 12 cent by January 1993. Core capi- to tal, comprising only common ig- equity and undated preference shares, must reach 4 per cent of L- assets. National Westminster's I Tier I ratio is just over 5 per cent, e comfortably inside the Basle 1 target. e The choice of Salomon .1 Brothers to lead the issue may be a explained by the US firm's spe- r cialist knowledge of the market I- for bank securities. The firm has a been active in gaining access to e new sources of capital which are f acceptable to the regulators."

   "text_content" : "John Ridding in Seoul examines the forthcoming liberalisation of the Korean stock market N LESS than four months, the doors of the Korean stock market will finally creak open to foreign investors. The market - the fifth biggest in Asia in terms of capitalisation, and third biggest in terms of turnover - is the largest in the world which is still closed to for- eigners. Until now, overseas investors have had little firm evidence to evaluate the extent of Korea's lib- eralisation. But the release of final guidelines last week - though leaving several important areas unclear - sets the parame- ters for foreign ownership of Kor- ean equity. These parameters are limited. Foreigners will be restricted to owning 10 per cent of the shares in most Korean companies and 8 per cent of those involved in public utilities or other sensitive industries. A few other companies, includ- ing Kepco, the leading electricity company, will be completely barred to foreigners. For foreign individuals, the limit will be 3 per cent ownership of the shares of any one company. But the opening is even more restricted than these limits sug- gest. Outstanding Euromarket equi- ty-linked issues such as convert- ible bonds will be counted towards the various ownership limits. So too will strategic direct investments such as the 10 per cent of Kia Motors, Korea's sec- ond largest carmaker, which is owned by Ford of the US. Taking these existing invest- ments into account, and assum- ing an overall market capitalisa- tion as high as $130bn (Â£75bn) at the time of opening, this would mean that a total of about $7?n worth of Korean stocks are eligi- ble for foreign investment. Excluding these existing investments, current market cap- italisation is estimated at about $120bn by some analysts, which places it in the same league as the Hong Kong market. Holders of existing Euromarket issues will, however, have some advantages. From next month they will be able to convert those bonds which are due into under lying shares and trade them on the Seoul stock exchange. In so doing, however, they wil lose the current premiums at which the equity-linked issues are trading. The opening of the Korean market is in line with the govern- ment's capital market liberalisa- tion programme announced in 1988 which set a timetable for opening the door to foreign inves- tors. Pressure from trading part ners, in particular the US, has kept the Korean government to its commitments. \"These guidelines are the last step which we promised in 1988,\" says Mr Oum Bong Sung, coun- sellor to the minister of finance. \"But they are also the first step in the second round of market opening\" and that the limits for foreign ownership will be gradu- ally increased. Moreover, he says that the gov- ernment will take a flexible stance concerning investment in companies which breach their foreign ownership limits because of overseas issues or direct investments. Foreign ownership of such companies could be allowed as high as 25 per cent, while issues of new classes of shares might also be permitted. The question now is how many foreign investors will attend the Â·Â· __ Â·_ opening party. Clearly the maxi- mum potential investment will not come flooding in immedi- ately. But just how appealing is the Korean market likely to prove? The Seoul exchange is not the same market of 1987 and 1988 when the index virtually doubled in successive years on the back of rapid, export-led economic development. It has since fallen from a 1989 peak of 1,007 points to about 681 today. Much of the reason is found in a host of eco- nomic problems such as rising manufacturing costs and the erosion of industrial competi- tiveness. But there has also been a rethinking of the view that Kor- ean companies could quickly catch their rivals in Japan and the west. London analysts think that there will be substantial business in South Korean shares. According to Baring Securities, one of the four foreign securities firms granted permission to open branches in Seoul, Korean com- panies that have already issued convertible and warrant bonds and global depository receipts are - all standing at a premium to i underlying share prices in Seoul. i- Mr Peter Bristowe, a director of s Hoare Govett International, says o the sheer size of the market should bring in the institutions e in a big way. 8 Improving economic funda- d mentals coincide with equity k market ratings which are not as c \"stratospheric\" as they were sev- * eral years ago. a The Korean economy remains one of the most dynamic in the world. A growth rate forecast at s 8.9 per cent this year will see few equals while the problems of s inflation and a rising trade deficit I remain manageable. - Even with a run-up prior to i January, foreign investors are likely to find a reasonably-priced y market. The weighted price-earn- I ings ratio for the market as a whole is about 20 less than Tokyo t and Taipei and others of the big s Asian markets. Measures such as price to book value and price to gross cash flow reveal still s cheaper shares. i The more familiar blue chip stocks are likely to have appreci- I ated ahead of the entry of for- a eigners and may quickly see their ownership ceilings reached. o As a result, it may be second- 1. tier and smaller companies which )f provide the best potential. \"There ,s is tremendous value to be found !t among smaller companies,\" says is Mr Peter Irving, managing direc- tor of Korea Schroder Fund Man- i- agement. But he cautions that y many are highly geared, while is liquidity can also be a problem. 7- The attraction of the various stocks alone, however, will not a determine the success of the mar- e ket opening. Just as important It will be the practicalities of w investing in the market such as if placing orders and moving capi- It tal in and out of Korea. On this count, much detail o remains to be clarified. There are e still grey areas concerning the d permitted use of funds held in i- the accounts of foreign investors, a arrangements for dealing and o commissions, and whether for- g eign investors have to deposit s funds in advance of executing a o trade. 1 The ministry of finance prom- ises a series of further announce- p ments to clarify such concerns. i- But with January set as the open- *- ing date, time is ticking away. r Additional reporting by William Cochrane in London",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent BEAZER, the heavily indebted construction and building materi- als group, yesterday announced an agreement with its bankers over refinancing, paving the way for the sale of its UK-based housebuilding, property and con- tracting businesses. The agreement with about 100 lending banks requires repay- ment by Beaser of at least g600m (2355m). This is to be raised primarily from the flotation of the UK busi- nesses. The pathfinder prospec- tus for the sale is due to be pub- lished today. The group's net debt at the end of June was Â£1.025bn compared with shareholders' funds of Â£1.115b, said Mr Brian Beazer, chairman and chief executive. Details of the refinancing were announced as Beazer revealed pre-tax profits, including the UK d operations, fell 43 per cent to - Â£60.6m during the 12 months to d the end of June. rs Group turnover fell by 16 per L cent to Â£1.93bn from 22.3bn. d Operating profits of the UK- a- based business, which will become a separately quoted com- j) pany known as CHB, fell more V- than a third to 5S3m. The number n of homes built fell to 5,006 from 5,372 making it Britain's fourth ;y largest housebuilder. i- Profits from the US building c- material operations, retained by b the Beaser group, fell more than 40 per cent to Â£64.4m. d Under the refinancing, divi- d dend payments by the remainder I of the Beazer group will be r, strictly controlled. Payments above a minimal level will 4 depend on whether the group 1 exceeds agreed profit levels, K according to bankers. o In return, the group, following o the initial repayment of $600m, will not have to repay further ar capital until the end of 1996. It will have to repay interest on .- loans during this period. 11 CHB will become a separately a- quoted company with almost no e debt. It will be free to establish r its own loan arrangements and n dividend policy. h About 10 per cent of CHB shares are expected to be g reserved for Beazer group share- Y holders, who will be given prior- n ity allocations in the flotation. About half Beazer's shareholders i- are thought to be in the US. r Beazer said yesterday that a total group dividends, which for * the last time include the UK busi- U nesses, had been reduced to 4p p from 7.75p. Its shares fell 7p to i, dclo at 88p Lx, Page 20",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller MACARTHY, owner of the UK chemist shop chain which has attracted three takeover offers, yesterday capitulated to the Â£83m offer from Lloyds Chem- ists. Lloyds' bid was the highest since Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate set the ball rolling in May. A deci- sion by the Office of Fair Trad- ing on Friday to refer UniChem's Â£75m bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission removed the other strong contender. Although UniChem, the phar- maceuticals wholesaler, might have returned to the fray, Mr Ian Parsons, Macarthy's chief execu- tive, said: \"The prospect of another three months' uncer- tainty was diabolical.\" He and the rest of the Macarthy board will resign once the deal goes through. Lloyds' offer of one new share plus i2p cash for each of Macarthy's values the stock at 301p. This compares with 168p on the eve of Grampian's first bid. Lloyds already owned or had acceptances for 23 per cent. The attraction of Macarthy, which owns the Savory & Moore chain, included the recession-re- sistant nature of chemists' shops and a government-imposed bar- rier to the opening of pharma- cies. Lloyds still has to gain clear- ance from the OFT, which referred UniChem because of worries about competition in the wholesaling of prescription drugs. If the Lloyds' bid is cleared, the additional 175 chemists' shops will take its total to 810, consolidating its position as sec- ond to Boots, which has 1,069. It will be the group's second big acquisition this year, follow- ing the Kingswood chemists' and Holland & Barrett health stores acquired for Â£55m in May, financed by a Â£71m one-for-two rights issue.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Peston and Roland RuM BRENT WALKER'S board was last night holding a crisis meeting, in the offices of its solicitors, Simmons & Sim- mons, to decide how to respond to the refusal of holders of its convertible bonds to back a reconstruction plan. Earlier in the day, Mr Ken Scobie, chief executive of the troubled leisure group, had met with Mr Christopher Spor- borg, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, who is advis- ing the dissident bond holders. Mr Sporborg told him that there was no question of enough bondholders backing the reconstruction plan to allow it to go through. This came as a blow to the company, which had hoped that a statement put out the m previous day by the bond- is holders left some scope for ts negotiation. a- \"The reconstruction plan is Id dead\", commented a bond- ts holder. He added that Brent a Walker's directors had only two options. In They must either agree to ie negotiate with Lonrho, the d trading group which says it ir- wants to acquire Brent Walker, f or they must put the company s- into receivership. S. He said there was a very at remote third option. The dissi- Ds dent bondholders, led by Mr g Michael Smurfit and his com- o pany, Jefferson Smurfit, would accept a revision of the recon- ae struction plan which gave the d bondholders security ahead of ke a new tranche of preference I- shares being issued to the r banks. However, the banks said yes- a terday that they would never - agreeto this, as a point of prin- y Brent Walker's banks had also been united in their oppoW o sition to Lonrho's offer. But e some of them broke ranks yes- It terday and said they would be r, prepared to consider an offer, if y Lonrho was prepared to pro- vide financial support to Brent y Walker while it was inspecting I- the leisure group's assets, a r process known as due dill- i- gence. 1 The banks' concern has been i- that they would continue to e fund Brent Walker while Lon- f rho carried out its due dill- e gence inspection, only to find that Lonrho was not pr to make an acceptable oer-r. The result would hav been an unnecessary increase in the banks' exposure to Brent Walker. \"Lonrho will have to put up around Â£20m\", said a banker. Lonrho yesterday said it would be wiling to provide the necessary bridging loan. But a Lonrho director laid down a strict condition. \"If the bid did not come to anything then we would expect to have our money back first on the basis of whoever puts in the funds last gets them back first. One banker said last night he did not believe that any money put in by Lonrho should rank ahead of the banks' loans.",

   "text_content" : "By Jan Fullor RIS GROUP bucked the recessionary trend in the engi. neering sector by raising both its interim profits and divi- dend. Taxable profits increased by nearly 6 per cent to Â£7.06m (Â£6.66m) in the first half of 1991. If the specialist engineer delivers pre-tax profit expects- tions of Â£14.5m for the full year, Â£lm ahead of 1990, it will have achieved 21 years of growth. EIS also announced yester- day the Â£3.85m purchase of Flightspares, a distributor of aircraft parts, but said the Â£18.3m raised in a rights issue in April remained intact, giv- ing it scope for further acquisi- tions. Interest received had risen by about Â£200,000 as a result of the issue. Turnover of Â£92.lm (Â£86.4m) was helped by just over S3m from last year's acquisition of Davall, a maker of gear prod- ucts. Mr Howard Wormsley, com- mercial director, said inflation had been irrelevant. \"We decided it would be exceptional to pay any supplier any increase.\" However, EIS's cus- tomers had often taken a simi- lar view. The group had been fleet of foot in terms of finding new applications and geographic destinations for its products. Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the strongest performance had come from the Flexibox seals and cou- plings division, where demand had been buoyant from oil refiners. Aircraft and precision engi- neering was similar to the first half of last year, while process equipment had shown some vulnerability to the motor and consumer goods sectors. The group was protected by the geographic spread of its businesses. Two thirds of turnover lies overseas, with about half of that in continental Europe. There are factories in 11 coun- tries and the group operates in another six. Earnings per share, adjusted for the 1-for-4 rights issue, were 14.211p (13.954p). The interim dividend is 3.175p (3.025p). * COMMWNT One virtue of the UK recession has been to sort the wheat from the chaff, giving a com- pany like EIS a chance to r shine. It has proved particu- larly adept at passing on its disciplines to acquisitions and the cash it has in hand will enable that process to be amply repeated. Flightspares should prove a classic example, for behind its measly 199091 I pre-tax profit of Â£230,000 lie I sales of more than Â£llm and operating profit of nearly im. April's rights issue price of 265p, at quite a discount to the i market price of 327p, looks even cheaper at yesterday's I close of 370p, a new high. Bou- quets aside, there are two slight dampeners. One is that the extra shares in issue, com- ing only two years after the i last rights issue, will keep I earnings per share flat this year and next, even on another forecast rise to Â£16m in 1992. i The other is that EIS is short on recovery potential, although I in 1993 a late-cycle upturn in process equipment should coin- cide with the full benefit of i acquisitions picked up in the recession. On a prospective p/e of less than 13, it is at a dis- count to recovery stocks in i engineering and remains a t strong hold.",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox Molins, the international tobacco and packaging machinery group, yesterday set October 1 as the date for the extraordinary meeting at which it will defend its inde- pendence from Leucadia National, the US manufactur- ing and financial conglomer- ate which already owns 48.5 per cent of its shares. The company has urged shareholders to reject Leuca- dia's resolutions to replace selected board directors. These would give it a majority on the Molins board if successful. Molins has also declared a 3 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Â£6.8m (Â£7.0m) for the six months to the end of June. Leucadia has steadily increased its stake since the failure of its offer for Molins in May 1990. It has now requi- sitioned the EGM and will pro- pose to remove three non-exec- utive directors of Molins and appoint six of its own nomi- nees. Molins argues that Leucadia is attempting to secure control without making a full offer to shareholders, \"consistent with its corporate history but alien to the generally accepted prin- ciple in the United Kingdom\". It points out that the Molins share price of about 357p is above Leucadia's offer of 275p per share in May 1990. Recent share purchases by Leucadia have been at 400p, Despite a 29 per cent rise in turnover to Â£75m, Molins man- aged only a 5 per cent increase in trading profits to Â£6.9m (Â£6.6m). Pension credits fell by Â£0.2m to Â£1.7m and interest pay- ments rose to Â£1.8m (Â£1.5m). Earnings fell 5 per cent to 16.4p (17.3p) and the half year dividend is maintained at 3p;",

   "text_content" : "By John Thiornhill ARJO WIGGINS Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group which was formed last year through the merger of Wiggins Teape Appleton and Arjomari. Prioux, yesterday reported \"encouraging\" progress against a difficult trading background. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 came to Â£186m set against a notional comparable figure of Â£142m. The profits outcome was in line with expectations but ana- lysts were disappointed that the dividend was only held at 3.3p. The shares fell 17p to close at 272p. AWA's sales slipped from Â£1.39m to Â£1.26m with lower prices disguising a marginal increase in sales volumes. Earnings per share amounted to 10.7p (11.7p). Mr Stephen Walls, chief executive, said the process of merging the two companies was progressing well - if at a slightly slower pace than he had originally hoped. \"If we look at the benefits of the merger then they certainly exceed those that we antici- pated at the time of the deal,\" he said. Mr Walls said the results had been adversely affected by neg- ative currency movements and the group's continued exposure to the hard-hit pulp manufac turing sector. But he added that AWA was at an advanced stage of discus- sions with Mondi, the South B p r B 1 t i 1 [* it t B r sale of Portuguese ;tareprosrsgn African paper group, regarding the sale of its 42.9 per cent stake in the Portuguese Sopor- cel pulp mill. A decision is expected before the end of the year. A previous attempt to sell the stake for Â£126m to Stora of Sweden fell foul of the Portu- guese government on competi- tion grounds. AWA's paper manufacturing activities saw a strong increase in operating profits from Â£126.9m to Â£142.2m as Appleton Papers in the US recorded strong gains. But paper mer- chanting was badly hit by depressed prices and profits fell from Â£14.3m to Â£8.8m. The company's forestry and pulp operations experienced a sharp reversal in their fortunes as a result of weakening prices and fell from a profit of Â£6.8m into a Â£4.9m loss. Mr Walls said he remained cautious about the prospects in the second half with recovery being delayed by the continu- ing over-capacity in some sec- tors of the paper market. But he added that demand in the US had begun to pick up and that there were \"glim- mers\" in the UK. \"There are the first signs of improvement in activity levels but it is very fragile,\" he said. France remained an uncer- tain market and Germany, which had remained extremely buoyant in the first six months, was beginning to soften, he said. See Lex",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox P-E International, the European management and :omputer consultancy, showed a 33 per cent slump in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1991, from Â£2.8m to Â£1.8m, as con- tinuing UK recession led to a shortfall in second quarter orders while staff costs rose. Turnover rose by 4 per cent to Â£33.6m helped by a 15 per xent rise in overseas fees, par- ticularly in systems and com- puter services, and by a brief recovery in UK fees after the Gulf war before the second quarter's disappointment. In the UK the systems group performed well but manage- ment consultancy, information technology and computer ser- vices were hit in the second quarter as their customers cut costs. Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, he said \"project start dates were ad postponed and too few red enquiries were converted into tax firm orders.\" 01, Total costs rose 7 per cent, on- partly because more fee-earn- )a Ing staff were needed to secure ter business.

Yet P-E has little choice but to retain key, expensive staff in order to get a share of the scanty available business. The pause in acquisitions while Handley-Walker is digested will give a chance to judge the strategy and to see whether other small acquisitions can match Westvries' success. A full year pre-tax figure of Â£4.35m (Â£4.2m) and earnings of 14.4p (15p) scarcely looks demanding given Handley- Walker's inclusion. But nor does it leave room for the kind of nasty surprises that other acquisitive \"people businesses\" have delivered such as ear- nouts that can be satisfied only if the whole group does well. A prospective p/e of 12.4 reflects the group's strong market posi- tion but will be vulnerable to further disappointment."

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen, Investments Correspondent MR TONY Barnes, former chairman of CLF Holdings, has agreed to buy back the trou- bled company from lenders to CLF Yeoman for a nominal sum. He sold his company to Shannon-based Yeoman Hold- ings, a large-ticket leas- ing operation, in 1988 for Â£93m. CLF Yeoman, said yesterday that its banks had agreed to restructure Â£39m in debts in exchange for a deal to spin off the company's troubled CLF subsidiary. All debts were incurred in connection with losses at the CLF subsidiary. Yeoman had earlier said that it had been unable to find a buyer for CLF, that it believed the subsidiary had no value, and that it had written its val- uation down to zero. CLF is a small ticket leasing company with operations in the UK and France. Trading in the company's shares were halted on Septem- ber 6 after the company said that talks with its 37 bankers had broken down. Trading will remain suspended until shareholders have received details of the restructuring arrangement, expected in mid-October. Meanwhile, CLF Yeoman said it was pursuing its claim against SG Warburg and solid- tors Unklaters and Payne. It said that they should have known about financial difficul- ties in a subsidiary of CLF which became evident shortly after the acquisition was com- pleted. CLF Yeoman said it was now seeking Â£67m in damages from Warburg, the difference between CLF's Â£98m purchase price and the unit's current value. The company said it was optimistic about prospects for its legal action but did not expect a hearing for at least 18 months.",

   "text_content" : "MACRO 4, the independent computer software company, lifted taxable profits from Â£7.35m to Â£7.65m in the year to June 30. Mr Tom Kelly, chairman, said there had been no easing of the difficult trading condi- tions he had reported at the interim stage. And looking ahead, he said the group remained exposed to overseas currencies, particularly the dollar. However, the continental European subsidiaries were anticipating continued growth, cash resources were strong and growing and he remained opti- mistic of more than a nominal profits, increase during the coming year. The company's marketing philosophy remained one of renting rather than selling its products. Earnings per share emerged at 23p (20.6p). A final dividend of 7.175p is recommended, lift- ing the total to Ulp (8.9p). Turnover improved by 22 per cent to Â£18m (Â£14.8m). The sub- sidiaries and agents contrib- uted 78 per cent (76 per cent) of sales, reflecting, Mr Kelly said, increasing commitment to overseas markets. All subsid- iaries continued to be cash generative and cash sufficient, he added.

The company blamed the recession. It added that it was not possible to judge the tim- ing of any upturn and hopes of an improvement in the second half were almost certain to be frustrated. Turnover was ahead at Â£28.3m (Â£27.8m) but that was at the expense of margins and trading profit fell to Â£990,000 (Â£1.49m). Net investment income and interest fell to Â£138m (Â£1.54m). Earnings were 3.4p, against a restated 4.29p. The interim div- idend is held at 1.4p. Ferrum concerned over Dutch side Ferrum Holdings, the engineer- ing and oilfield services group, lifted taxable profits by 34 per cent over the six months to June 30. The advance - from Â£1.06m to Â£1.42m - came on turnover ahead to Â£24m (Â£22.1m) and according to Mr Simon Miller, chief executive, represented \"a continuing advance in spite of the current economic climate.\" However, Mr Gordon Dun- lop, who is to retire as chair- man at the year-end, warned that the Dutch economy showed signs of slowing, a trend that could affect the group's structures division. The interim dividend is raised to U.lp (ip), payable from earnings of 3.82p (34p). Herring Son & Daw just ahead to Â£18m Taxable profits of Herring Son & Daw Holdings, commercial property consultant, edged aead from Â£1.9m to Â£Llm in the six months ended July 31.

The outcome - down from Â£2.24m to Â£636,000 - was struck after a Â£222,000 excep- tional charge for redundancy costs. Turnover was up from Â£9.05m to Â£10.8m.

Difficult traduig at Lambert Howarth Trading at Lambert Howarth remaines \"difficult and compet- itive\" according to Mr Roger Rowland, chairman of the Lan- cashire-based footwear group. Despite an advance in tax- able profits, from Â£1.33m to Â£l.49m, \"there is no sign yet of a retail upturn\", he said. The company had to absorb a pro- portion of the rise in VAT rates. The improvement came on i turnover of Â£22.9m (SM.7m). 1 After tax at an estimated 29 per cent (30 per cent) earnings improved to 18.p, against Mp lst timeh and the nterim dividend is lifted to 4p (36p).

The fall, from Â£2.77m to Â£2.09m, came from turnover down from Â£29.5m to Â£21.2m. Lord Rippon of Hexham, chairman, said the results reflected the continuing diffi- cult economic conditions for service industries and for employment businesses in par- ticular. Earnings per share came out at 2.13p (2.78p) but the interim dividend is held at 0.6p.

Following an increased tax charge, earnings per share worked through at 8p (8.3p). The interim dividend goes up to 2.5p (2.4p). Fairbriar shares suspended Shares of Fairbriar, the Epsom- based housebuilder and devel- oper, were suspended at 8p yes- terday: \"pending clarification of the company's financial position.\" The shares were suspended at the company's request. Mr Remo Dipre, Fairbriar's chairman, announced in Febru- ary that the group had made a pre-tax loss of Â£321m during the six months to September 30 1990. He then warned that the company might have to make provisions against its property assets which could lead to an increase in borrowings.

Robinson Brothers shows 85% advance Partly because of an improve- ment in the sterling-dollar exchange rate, Robinson Brothers (Ryders Green), maker of organic chemicals, achieved an 85 per cent advance in pre-tax profits, in the half year to June 29. On turnover up from Â£10.4m to Â£12.1m the taxable result came out at Â£758,000 (Â£410,000). Earnings were 25p (10p) per Â£1 share. The company's shares I are not quoted.

Mr Harold Cantor, chairman, said that although the com- pany made record first half profits it had not been immune from the chancellor's stated intention of restricting con- sumer demand. In addition, bad weather, the Gulf war and the increase in the VAT rate combined to make the second half extremely difficult.

Recession catches up with Gaskell Exposure to the depressed con- struction and motor industries weighed heavily upon Gaskell, the Lancashire-based carpets group. Taxable profits for the six months to June 28 slumped to just Â£55,000 against Â£1.06m last time. Turnover declined to Â£16.8m (Â£20.8m) reflecting lower sales of contract carpet tiles and automotive uphol- stery products.

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels GENERALE de Banque, Belgium's biggest commercial bank, pushed up net profit by nearly 9 per cent in the first half of 1991, but at the same time increased provisions against loan losses in the light of continuing economic uncer- tainties. The group made BFr4.61bn ($129m) in the first half, against BFr4.24bn in the equiv- alent period last year. Gendrale said the increase in profit was due to a rise in Belgian franc interest income, despite shrinking margins, an improvement in commissions and foreign currency margin i, income, and continued strict 1 cost controls, which helped y reduce overheads slightly. t \"All things being equal, the e improving trend in profitabil- s ity demonstrated during the t first half-year should be main- tained during the second six months,\" the bank said. i Depreciation charges and , provisions rose by 14 per cent to BFr4.38bn from BFr3.84bn, B of which the bulk was provi- 5 sions against loan losses. c A Gendrale spokeswoman e said yesterday: \"We have a tra- i dition of being very prudent as s far as provisions are con- i cerned.\" t The group said that lending I to the private sector had risen by 6.9 per cent to BFrl,114bn, against BFrl,041bn, while pub- lic sector lending declined i slightly to BFr611bn from BFr623bn.

Mainframe computer sales with related products and ser- vices, generate over half of IBM's revenues and a larger portion of profits, making the new product announcements critical for the company. IBM's operating profits plunged by 74 per cent in the first half of this year, and rev- enues were down by 8 per cent, raising the spectre that it may report its first annual fall in revenues in 45 years. The new mainframe models will complete IBM's Enterprise Systems new generation of mainframe computers, the first of which were unveiled last year. With today's announcement, IBM will bring technologies Introduced last year in the first phase of Enterprise System products to the lower end of the main- frame product line. The company is expected to announce computers with one, two or three central processor units, complementing bigger machines which it recently began shipping. Over the past year, main- frame sales have been depressed by poor economic conditions. Industry analysts also say potential customers may have been waiting to see IBM's new machines rather than buy current products. The unveiling of the new mainframes will provide a test of this theory, determining the real strength of demand in the high end computer sector. The new computers will also boost IBM's competitive position versus makers of IBM \"plug- compatible\" mainframes, Amdahl and Hitachi Data Systems. _Â·I_____",

   "text_content" : "By Our Financial Staff PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car maker, suffered a drop in earnings in its sinan- cial year to July 31 1991 and said it will have to struggle to maintain profits and sales in 1991-92. Mr Arno Bohn, chief execu- tive, said he did not see an end to the recession in the US or Britain. \"The weakness in western European countries continues. The trend is not turning around and poorer conditions will prevail,\" he added. In the past few years, the company has been recovering F from a slump in US sales, trig- i gered by the 1987 stock market crash and the weakness of the 1 dollar, by upgrading Its models 3 and reducing its dependence 1 on North Ambrica. But the severe weakness of the US market, which has I affected all foreign imports, r has dampened its progress in i the past year. Porsche said yes- s terday that its turnover in t 1990-91 slipped by 3 per cent to r DM2.95bn ($1.7bn) from i DM3.05bn. It gave no profit figure, but ! the company has already indi- J cated that net income fell to between DM50m and DM60m from DM68.4m (a rise of 26 per cent on 1988-9). Much of the weaker earnings trend in the past financial year stemmed from the weakness of the dollar, which accounted for some DM60m of the DMI00m sales decline. Model changes and the eco- nomic uncertainty caused by the Gulf war also hit business, as did the recession in key markets. Porsche recently cut its US sales force after a 52 per cent slide in sales there so far in 1991. Porsche also said that its car deliveries fell by 18 per cent from 31,235 units to 26,500 in the 1990-91 financial year. Because of the rise in domestic deliveries and the fall in foreign sales, the proportion of its output sold abroad fell from 69 per cent to 56.5 per cent. This financial year, Mr Bohn said, sales and profits could be maintained at the previous year's levels \"only with the greatest effort\". He said that Japan was one bright sport, however; every sixth Porsche is currently sold in that coun- try.",

   "text_content" : "By MarUtn Dickson In New York H.J. HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday announced a 78 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, thanks to the recent disposal of a milling business, and said it would use much of the gains from the sale for sig- nificant Job cuts around the world and a large increase in its marketing spending. Heinz reported net income of $254.4m, or 95 cents a share, compared $143.2m, or 54 cents, in the same period of last year. However, the results included a $221m pre-tax gain on the sale last June of Hubinger, a corn milling operation in Iowa. Sales dipped from $1.56bn to $1.50bn, due partly to the dis- posal of Hubinger and the sale last April of its Caribbean Res- taurants business. Heinz bought JL Foods, a big spe- cialty US foods supplier last month, but it will only start to be included in earnings from ds the second quarter. La Heinz said its sales in the ter first quarter had been hit by int reduced unit volume and the ss, strengthening of the dollar. of However, this had been partly ig- offset by an increase in the he value of sales, due to price in increases on many of the com- pany's core products. of Mr Anthony O'Reilly, chair- re, man, said the gain from the ts, sale of Hubinger gave the com- ar. pany a unique opportunity to ed go on the attack, increasing he marketing support for its a brands and accelerating its ra. current cost reduction pro- to grammes. This would allow the is- company to deliver full-year de results in line with past trends as- and, together with the JL nz Foods acquisition, would we- \"enable us to extend our ist growth trend through the to 1990s.\" im Mr O'Reilly later said 1992 earnings should be in the range of .388 to 92.40 a share compared with $2.13 last year - higher than some Wall Street estimates. Over the past five years, Heinz's sales have grown at an 8.8 per cent compound rate, while its operating income grew at a rate of 14. per cent. A company spokesman said the company planned to make significant job cuts, affecting both the US and Europe, as part of its cost reduction pro- gramme, although it was too early to put a figure on the total. It also planned to increase its annual marketing spend by some $100m in the current financial year, or 15 to 20 per cent. It will focus partic- ularly on tuna, pet food and weight loss products. However, despite the opti- mistic tone, Heinz shares closed at $38%, down $2%.",

The 52-week low is US$73. Mr Philip Koven, an analyst with Richardson Greenshields, Canada, said Seagram would repurchase stock on market weakness. As with most other analysts, he has reduced his estimate of Seagram's fiscal 1992 earnings - to US$7.65 a share from US$8.05. - TLC Beatrice International, the foods group, has sold its French distribution unit, Max- ime Delrue, to Tropicana Con- tinental, AP-DJ reports. The purchase price was not dis- closed. Tropicana Continental is the French affiliate of Tropicana Products, a wholly-owned sub- sidiary of Seagram. Maxime Delrue has imported and sold, among other prod- ucts, Tropicana orange and grapefruit juices for more than 25 years. TLC said it planned to use the proceeds for general corpo- rate purposes. Tropicana said that Maxime Delrue would operate as a sep- arate subsidiary within Tropi- cana Europe.",

A spokesman for Philip Mor- ris said that since last week it has been negotiating with a group of US and international banks to increase the size of its existing long-term credit facility to $15bn, and extend the lifetime of the credit line until October 1996. The facility was first negoti- ated in 1988 and under the ini- tial agreement was due to expire in March 1998. The spokesman would not specify what Philip Morris intended to do with the extra credit, but said it was for \"general corporate purposes\". Wall Street analysts, how- ever, believe the group is plan- ning a sizeable acquisition of another food manufacturer, possibly In Europe or the Pacific Rim region."

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown n Sydney COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia yesterday blamed recession and increased bad debts for a 45 per cent fall in net operating profits to A$272m (US8214.1m) for the year to the end of June. The result, which was in line with market forecasts, comes two days before Common- wealth's debut on the Austra- lian Stock Exchange following the flotation last month of just under 30 per cent of the stock. Most of the fall in net profits was accounted for by a 122 per cent increase to A$1.02bn in charges for bad and doubtful debts following the takeover of the State Bank of Victoria (SBV) last year. The A$1.6bn acquisition of SBV followed a rescue package agreed between the federal and Victoria state governments in the wake of the crash of Tri- continental, SBV's merchant banking subsidiary. Analysts had forecast a sig- nificant increase in Common- wealth's bad debt portfolio because of SBVs exposure to corporate failures in Victoria, the centre of Australia's domestic recession. However, Commonwealth said SBV had begun to contrib- ute to operating profits in the second half. The purchase of SBV had been of \"major strate- gic value\", and would yield fur- ther benefits when the integra- tion of the two banks was completed, the board said. Commonwealth said net profit had risen to A$889m, including abnormal items of A$617m. The main abnormal item was a transfer of A$533m from the bank's superannua- tion fund to reflect surplus contributions. Net profit after abnormals last year was AS531m. Mr Don Sanders, managing director, said the bank had fol- lowed a \"conservative\" provi- sioning policy in the light of the difficulties facing custom- ers as a result of the recession. \"The bank's operating profit was affected by the recession- ary conditions which slowed the economy, contributed to a fall in demand for finance and led to increased bad and doubt- ful debts,\" he said. Mr Sanders said weak domestic activity and depressed world markets for key exports were expected to I limit opportunities during the I current year and would inten- sify competition for quality lending. \"However, Commonwealth Bank is well positioned to share in the benefits when the economic recovery gets under way,\" he said. The board said the bank expected to pay its first interim dividend on April 30 and its first final dividend in October. The payout was likely to be higher than returns to the gov- ernment in recent years, the I directors said. t The federal government I raised A$1.3bn from the flota- tion of just under 30 per cent of Commonwealth, the biggest flotation in Australian corpo- 1 rate history. The flotation was oversub- i scribed by A$600m, indicating t that the A$5.40 shares would trade at a significant premium when the bank is listed tomorrow.",

The group said it had sold 14.17m shares held by Primera, a subsidiary, and 1.25m shares held by the TNT Superannua- tion Fund for a total of A$2.47m (US$1.9m). The group said the sale price represented a profit of A$2.47m, indicating the holding had been written down to zero. The stake was bought by Den Duyts, a company associ- ated with senior Petroleum Securities executives, includ- ing Mr Adrian Fletcher, the chairman,' and Mr Terry Fern, the managing director. Petroleum Securities oper- ates in the Canning Basin of Western Australia, in Papua New Guinea, and in the US, where it has extensive oil and gas interests, including a joint venture in the Rocky Moun- tains with Ampol Exploration. The company also has small gold mining interests through its subsidiaries Climax Mining and Salamander Gold Mines. TNT has been disposing of non-core holdings since report- ing a net loss of A$197m for 1990-91. The sales are intended to reduce debt, following wor- ries over the group's liquidity. Last month, TNT sold half of its 19.7 per cent stake in Nor- mandy Poseidon, the Austra- lian resources group, for A$51.5m. TNT has also taken steps to stem heavy losses from its express delivery activities in Europe, where it has formed joint ventures with a number of post offices.",

   "text_content" : "ASHOK Leyland, the Madras- based commercial vehicle man- ufacturer, is restructuring its operations in an attempt to accelerate growth, writes Gita Piramal in Bombay. In the first phase of the shake-up, the company plans to spend Rs5.68bn ($220.8m) on developing a new series of vehicles, the Ashok Leyland 2000, with payload capacities of 4 to 8 tonnes. Mr R. J. Shahaney, manag- ing director, said: \"It is a global concept. We want to tie together technology from Iveco of Italy, Hico of Japan and ZF of Germany with Indian auto- mobile technology. We hope it will give our vehicles a com- petitive edge in world markets.\" To help finance the develop- ment programme, Ashok Ley- land is launching a Rs2.15bn issue of partially convertible debentures on a rights basis. The company, a member of the Hinduja Group, a diversi- fied $2bn international trading house, recently announced good results for the fiscal year to the end of March. Sales, at Rs9.23bn, were up by 34 per cent, while gross profit was Rs919m compared with last year's Rs756m. The company sold 24,698 vehicles locally and exported 1,189. Profits after tax were Rs262m. At the same time, Ashok Leyland accounts show an 18 per cent rise in financial expenses which probably cut into margins. With interest rates soaring and the rupee steadily weaken- ing against other currencies, the cost of the new capital investment may turn out to be heavier than anticipated, however.",

   "text_content" : "By Patrick Harveron in New York and Sara Webb in London US BOND prices weakened slightly at the long end of the market yesterday after some market players trimmed their long positions in the absence of an interest rate cut by the Fed- eral Reserve. In late trading the bench- mark 30year bond was down A at 101& yielding 8.005 per cent. The two-year note, however, rose A to 100&, to yield 6.186 per cent. The declines yesterday were to be expected. Bonds firmed sharply on Monday in expecta- tion of an interest rate reduc- tion, so it was inevitable that when the Fed failed to move, some of those who had bought bonds would sell them. The balance of opinion, how- ever, still favours a 50-basis point cut in the discount rate to 5 per cent, but analysts now feel that the Fed is waiting GOVERNMENT BONDS until tomorrow and Friday's producer and consumer prices data before acting. Yet, every day that passes without a Fed easing will chip away at the market's hopes for lower inter- est rates. *UK government bond prices rallied on signs of a slowdown in inflation, but the market fell back later in the day on profit- taking and sterling's weakness to close slightly lower. The announcement that pro- ducer price inflation had slowed more than expected, with a 0.1 per cent increase in August compared with a 0.4 per cent rise in July, confirmed hopes of a fall in inflation. Output prices rose 5.6 per cent in the year to August, down from a rate of 5.9 per BENCHMARK GOVERNMENT BONDS Red Week Meha Coupon Da1 MPe 41Chang Yid age1 ageo AUSTRALIA 12000 11/01 106.1872 +0.064 10.6 10.74 10.69 BELGIUM 9.000 06/01 9.66500 -0.250 9.21 9.22 9.37 CANADA * 9.750 12/01 101.1500 +0.060 9.57 9.64 9.83 DENMARK 9.000 1100 90.2250 +0.050 9.12 9.22 9.35 FRANCE BTAN 8.600 11/96 97.6908 -0.038 9.06 9.11 9.29 OAT 9.500 01/01 103.5400 -0230 8.91 8.93 9.13 GERMANY 8.750 08/01 102.1400 -0.220 8.42 8.41 8.58 ITALY 12.500 03/01 96.4600 +0.130 13.19 13.31 13.46 JAPAN No 119 4.800 06/99 90.8846 - 6.57 6.59 6.89 No 129 6.400 03100 100.8626 0.028 6.24 6.30 6.51 NETHERLANDS 8.00 03/01 98.1600 -0.220 8.78 8.74 8.87 SPAIN 11.900 07/96 101.1500 0.140 11.54 11.59 11.91 UK GILTS 10.000 11/96 101-10 +02/32 9.66 9.87 10.07 10.000 02/01 101-24 -01/32 9.71 9.82 10.02 9.000 10/08 95-24 +03/32 9.51 9.62 9.78 US TREASURY 7.875 06/01 10140 -01/32 7.72 7.82 7.95 8.125 068/21 101-09 -0532 8.01 8.07 8.17 London closing, 'denotes New York closing Yields Local market standard Prices: US, UK in 32nds.. others In decimal Technlcal DataeATLAS Price Sources cent in July. The expected continued fall in PPI inflation is expected to feed through to further falls in RPI inflation over the next few months, leading to hopes of further base rate cuts. The Bank of England took advantage of the market rally to sell some of its three tranches of gilts. Traders reported some switching from short-dated gilts into long- dated issues as investors moved away from the area of funding. The Liffe gilt futures con- tract opened at 95.05 and traded at around 95.06 by late afternoon, while the bench- mark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07, which opened at 113%, slipped to 1131. * PROFIT-TAKING pushed French government bond prices down % of a point yes- terday, following the market's recent rally. Traders said rumours swept the market that Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, was about to resign. However, the fall in bond prices was attributed mainly to profit-taking and the lead given by the US Treasury bond market. The 9.5 per cent OAT due 2001 ended at 103.54, to yield 8.91 per cent, against 103.77 and 8.88 per cent at Monday's close. The yield spread over the equivalent German bund was 51 basis points, compared to 50 on Monday. * JAPANESE government bonds reached new highs yes- terday as the yen strengthened against the dollar to give a yen-dollar exchange rate of below 135. However, bond prices fell back to close lower on the day as hopes of an easing in US interest rates faded. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB, which opened at 6.225 per cent, moved to 6.205 per cent before closing at 6.24 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "HE Tokyo foreign exchange market has seen a drop In business volume so sharp that some banks are reducing their operations and others are pulling out alto- gether. The decline has most seri- ously affected foreign banks in Tokyo, some of which have relied on foreign exchange trading as a mainstay. Like other financial markets in Japan, the Forex sector is a victim of the squeeze on credit which slowed investment activity. Last week, dollar-yen spot volume traded through Forex brokers fell to a six-year low of $860m. Volume has fallen steadily, with daily averages down to $4bn in August, less than one-third of last Octo- ber's $12.7bn peak. Mr Akihiko Kagawa, chief dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, says that interbank direct dealing among banks Foreign banks are packing up or slimming their operations as the credit squeeze hits foreign exchange trading, writes Emiko Terazono have also declined significantly. He says trust banks, one-time leading play- ers in the inter-bank market, have dropped out of the \"major league\" or banks trad- ing in lots of $50m in direct dealing. Trust banks have been hit by the decline in trust fund investment, with the weakness of the stock market prompting companies to cancel trust fund contracts. Investment levels by fund trusts have fallen from Y11,132bn ($8.2bn) in March 1990 to Y8,500bn in July this year. Mr Kagawa says that the number of banks in the \"$50m league\" has halved to seven or eight players. Another reason is the decline in cross-border capital flows. Turnover of overseas securities investment by Japa- nese institutions for the first six months of 1991 was 10 per cent down on the year-ago period. Mr Kagawa says institu- tional capital transactions, which at one stage constituted 80 per cent of trading volume, have almost disappeared. How- ever, because Japanese banks have a commitment in the Tokyo market, they cannot shrink their operations to the same extent as some foreign banks. Foreign exchange brokers, whose commissions are directly affected by business volume, are gloomier. Mr Kazuo Fujii, of Forex brokers Nittan AP, says that if the present situation was prolonged, some of the smaller brokers will face problems. Mr Fujii attributes the current sluggishness to the \"three Bs\" - the burst of the financial babble, the Bank of Interna- tional Settlement's capital asset ratio rules, and bank mergers. Some foreign banks have started to head for the door. First Interstate Bank of Calif- ornia moved its Forex operations to Singapore in May, while First National Bank of Boston has cut its Tokyo Forex operations by half. Mellon Bank moved out of Tokyo altogether in June. An official at the Institute of Foreign Banks in Tokyo says some banks are finding it difficult to justify keeping serv- eral trading rooms in the same time sornme. Of the 869 foreign bank branches in Tokyo, 27 banks reported losses at the end of March, while 15 h,--haB .ff-Â·avJd ,r*neJd prolt However, Mr Richard Mac- Donald, at Barclays Bank Tokyo, says tha it it has mainly been the US banks which have been contracting operations.

   "text_content" : "By Simon London THE DEARTH of new issues in the Eurodollar sector of the Eurobond market was broken yesterday with contrasting high-yield and very low-yield deals launched by Argentina and the European Investment Bank. Argentina added its name to the growing list of Latin Amer- ican borrowers which have returned to the international capital market this year. It launched a S300m two-year deal, lead-managed by J. P. Morgan Securities, and priced to offer investors a semi-an- nual yield of 11.3 per cent - a hefty yield spread over US Treasury bonds of 510 basis points. Participants in the deal reported strong demand from continental Europe and off- shore US investors, the two areas which have been most consistent buyers of Latin American paper. The bonds traded up from an issue price of 99% to be at 100% by the close of trading. Like Brazil, which has tapped the market this year through the Petrobras state- owned oil company, Argentina has not agreed a full debt rescheduling agreement with its bank creditors. In view of investors' concern about the credit quality of the issuer, the deal offers investors a put option after one year. A contrasting deal came from the European Investment Bank, which launched a $300m five-year issue lead-managed by S. G. Warburg. The deal car- ries a coupon of 7% per cent and was priced to yield 25 basis points over US Treasury bonds of this maturity - considered to be very tight by many inter- NEW INTERNATIONAL BOND ISSUES Borrower Amount m.

I Sandoz, the second largest Swiss pharmaceuticals group, i made a rare visit to the inter- national debt market, launch- 1 ing a $500m warrant bond issue, lead-managed by UBS Phillips & Drew. The seven-year bonds pay t a coupon of 4 per cent, and the warrants offer the right s to buy Sandoz shares at a price just SFrlO above the share price when the issue was launched - an exercise s premium of less than / per cent. The shares trade on a div idend yield of around 1.7 per a cent. t There are two classes of war- i rant convertible either into Sandoz bearer shares or t participation certificates, e which are traded outside of s Switzerland. e Participants in the deal said that the terms of the issue e were not seen as generous t enough to elicit an enthusias- a tic response from international d investors.

Mr Seidman (pictured below), who is shortly to leave the FDIC chairmanship, said he expected earnings to total $18bm or $19mb for the whole of 1991, compared with a total of $16.7b1 in 1990. The FDIC statistics showed that 88 per cent of banks were profitable in the April-June period, and over half reported higher earnings than a year earlier. However, this was off- set by continued commercial property loan problems, espe- cially in California and north-east US. \"Unfortunately, the second- quarter figures could be char- acterised as the banking industry bumping along the bottom of the recession. It doesn't look like it is getting much worse, but it doesn't look like it is getting much better,\" Mr Seidman said. He repeated his call for Con- gress to vote more money to recapitalise the bank insur- ance fund, although he expec- ted the fund still to have a positive balance by the end of this year.",

   "text_content" : "y ar Webb INVESTORS can expect to be bombarded by a steady stream of internationml equity issues from Europe and the emergn markets, but fewer issues m the US, in the final quarter of this year. The recent rise in world stock markets is likely to encourage equity offerings from: currently unlisted com- panies about to float; liated companies raising new capital; and secondary market trades, where a major shareholder decides to sell all or part of his stake in the company. A total of $8.04Sbn was raised through international equity issues in the first quar- ter, and $7.l18bn in the second quarter, according to figures from International Financing Review. With the summer lull draw- ing to a close, corporate finance departments expect a steady pick-up in activity. \"The outlook is for a very busy final quarter, particularly if we have one or two big deals,\" says one UK house. However, levels for the final quarter may not be quite as high as in the first or second, given that fewer US companies are expected to launch interna- tional equity issues in the final quarter as did in the first and second quarters of 1991. \"Most of the obvious financ- ing has been done - hom now on we only expect to see smaller deals emerging from the US,\" says one American house. In Europe, a handful of large international equity issues are expected in the next few months. The British Telecom offering scheduled for November is INTERNATIONAL BOUITIRS _ expected to amount to more than Â£5bn. Other companies are unlikely make any large offerings at the same time as BT so as to avoid competing for investors' funds. However, corporate finance departments do expect at least a handful of large European issues before and after the BT offering. Italy, Spain and, to a lesser extent, Portugal are seen as promising sources of interna- tional equity business in the next few months. Partial priva- tisations are expected in France, and possibly Sweden, during 1992. The main large European companies likely to announce large international equity issues in the noxt few months are: Banco di Napoll and posd- bly Credito taliano, as a result ot the planned reorganisation of the Itli banking sector; pol Spin's tat-controlled oi producer and refiner, which has already been partially pri- vatised; Total, the French state-controlled oil group which some investment banks believe could raise about N-OWm; Beazer, the heavily-bor- rowed construction and build- ing materials group, which plans to float its UK-based housebuilding and contracting businesses. Among the emerging econo- mies, Mexico is earning a reputation as an interesting market for investors. Interna- tional offerings have been launched recently by Grupo Carso, a holding company, and Empaques Ponderosa, a forestry company, while Televisa, the television and publish'i7< inup, is preparing an estimated $500m equity offering for November or December. \"Mexico has replaced Korea i as the number one emerging market,\" says one US house which expects to participate in i forthcoming Mexican deals. , \"People think it is a hot mar- ity ket, and generally view it as a ths bit more table than some Far mi- Eastern markets: it's close to ult the US and some Mexican com- Ion pales are seeking listings on or the NYSE.\" led Mexico has the additional ich advantage over Far Eastern pd- markets such as Korea and ich Taiwan of allowing direct mup equity investment. aks Until recently, foreign inves- iut tors have had to invest in Kor- Mor- ean and Taiwanese convertible lid- bonds or indirectly through ich country funds. However, the sed situation will change soon as ing Korea has promised to allow limited direct investment in no- certain equities next year. The r a announcement has raised ing interest in the Korean market 'na- among UK and European een investors recently. ipo Already, a stream of Korean ny, and Taiwanese deals - mainly I, a convertible bonds and bonds ile with warrants - is in the pipe- md line. These include: Far East- ing em Textiles, Taiwan's largest lity textiles group (lead-managed or by Salomon Brothers); Pacific Electric Wire and Cable, irea Taiwan's biggest cable maker Ing (lead-managed by Schroder); as use well as KIA motors, Hangyang a in Chemical, Dong-A Pharmaceu- als. ticals, and Ssangyong Cement iar- from Korea."

Mr Monaco, who is touring Europe to meet fund managers and other financial market investors, said, how- ever, that American Express had expanded its review of securitisation to include credit card receiv- ables. He said the company was looking at a minimum $200m to $400m securitisation of card receivables alone and a similar amount for Boston Co's mort- gage book. \"We haven't made a decision yet on the exact dollar amount,\" Mr Monaco said. However, he said it was possi- ble that the company would securitise at least $400m of its credit card and mortgage receivables by the end of the year. * Iraq is opening its first private bank with an initial capital of 100m dinars, the Iraqi News Agency reports.

   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-11",
   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Toronto SOME LEADING nickel producers are considering fol- lowing Inco's example of a pro- duction cut in an effort to head off a further decline in metal prices. Inco, the world's second-big- gest producer after Norilsk in the Soviet Union, is trimming its output of refined nickel by 10m lbs for the remainder of 1991 by halting production at some of its higher-cost facili- ties at Sudbury, Ontario. The company's output for 1991 was expected to be slightly higher than last year's 389m lbs. Its main rival, Falconbridge, is among others rumoured to be examining further produc- tion cuts. It recently announced a cut of more than 10 per cent at its Kristiansand refinery in Norway. Falcon- bridge officials were not avail- able for comment yesterday. Inco is concerned that grow- ing supplies, especially from the Soviet Union, may repeat the unsettling experience of early 1990, when prices fell as low as US$2.65 per lb. Three- month metal on the London Metal Exchange closed yester- day up $27.50 at $7,822.50 a (As at Monday's close) tonnes Aluminium +5.700 to631.650 Copper -1,350 to 306,650 Lead +125 to1096,050 Nickel +630 to 7.650 Zinc +1,750 to 0149.575 Tin -45 to 15,155 tonne, equivalent to $3.55 a lb. In addition, producers appear to have an eye on long-term contract negotia- tions which are due to start next month. The contracts, typically for three years in Inco's case, contain both floor and ceiling prices, and a weak market now might give cus- tomers extra leverage to demand a drop in contract prices from their present range of $2.50-$4.50 per lb. The nickel consumption pic- ture is mixed. Mr Victor Laza- rovici, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, said yester- day that North American stain- less steel producers have seen little recovery in demand, and have become cautious in their purchasing commitments. Inco however, is confident that strong demand in Japan and other parts of the Far East will offset stagnant markets in North America and Europe, and that western demand will be at least as strong as 1990's 1.5bn lbs. Lower consumption in the Soviet Union and east- ern Europe may be contribut- ing however, to rising Soviet supplies. An Inco official said yester- day that the production cut- backs will have no effect on its expansion plans at Thompson, Manitoba, which are proceed- ing on schedule. However, a hiring freeze has been rein- stated and all overtime work has been cancelled. In the Ontario division, pro- duction has been suspended at the Creighton No. 3 mine which was brought out of mothballs last October to meet strong demand.

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney THE Australian government yesterday stepped up its cam- paign against European Com- munity agricultural subsidies by launching a booklet designed to make consumers aware of the costs of the Com- mon Agricultural Policy. The CAP was the main tar- get of the Australian-led Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting nations during the unsuccessful Uruguay Round of the Gatt, which stalled last December in Brussels as a result of the row between the US and the EC over farm subsidies. Australia has long argued that EC consumers would not accept the costs of the CAP if they were aware of its full effects. However, the timing of the release of the booklet indi- cates it is intended to lay the groundwork for a renewed Cairns Group attack on the CAP when the Uruguay Round talks resume later this year. The government is paying A$40,000 (Â£18,000) for 7,000 copies of the booklet Are You Paying Too Much?, in an attempt to strengthen internal EC opposition to the CAP. The booklet is being pub- lished in English, French, Ger- man, Spanish and Italian, and will be distributed through Australian embassies to \"influ- ential\" groups such as taxpay- ers' associations and consumer groups. It says CAP subsidies increase taxes by up to 27 per cent and food prices by between 19 per cent and 52 per cent, adding Â£400 a year to the food bill and Â£225 to the tax bill for the average household. \"The pamphlet demonstrates that the CAP not only grossly distorts world trade, but also massively inflates the price EC consumers are charged for farm produce and the amount of tax they have to pay,\" said Dr Neal Blewett, the trade min- ister. The costs of protection- ism were not readily identifi- able to consumers, who tended to be unaware of the extent of the financial burden of the CAP, he said. \"It is not in the interests of their pro-protectionist govern- ments to make available this kind of information, which might encourage stronger calls for reform. This is why the Australian government has taken the unusual step of pre- paring information for dissemi- nation in another country.\" The booklet drew immediate criticism from Mr Ove Juul Jorgensen, leader of the EC delegation to Australia. He said it was \"not conducive\" to resolution of the Uruguay Round. \"I don't think it is the most brilliant idea in the final phase of these very complex negotiations,\" he said."

The gains came on the back of firmer copper and some forward trade buying interest. IPAI smelter stocks for July showed the total down 37,000 tonnes and unwrought down 63,000 tonnes underpinned prices. But traders pointed out that producers were only moving inventory to the LME, where stocks rose 62,875 tonnes in July. Copper prices were easier following profit taking and chart selling.

   "text_content" : "Kenneth Gooding, David Blackwell and Barbara Durr on post-coup confusion LAST MONTH'S abortive Kremlin coup d'etat and the ensuing constitutional crises have highlighted the impact on world commodity markets of the calamitous decline of the Soviet economy over the past two years. The question now concerns the extent to which increased western aid will allow the government to sat- isfy its population's hunger for food imports and take the edge of the country's appetite for hard currency, thereby staunching the flood of metals exports that have been under- mining western markets. American grain traders are awaiting new estimates this week from the US Department of Agriculture on Soviet supply and demand for grains. Fresh figures will be out tomorrow, based in part on the findings of a USDA team that was in the Soviet Union during the week of the coup examining the state of the Soviet wheat crop. In August, before the coup, the USDA had already raised its estimate of Soviet import needs during the 1991-92 grain marketing year to 37m tonnes, a 10.3m-tonne increase com- pared with last year. With $900m worth of US gov- ernment agricultural credits hanging in the balance, the coup had made the grain mar- ket gyrate wildly last month, first plummeting then shooting back up. But two problems are now casting a pall on the market: the political instability of the Soviet Union, and the unwill- ingness of commercial banks under these highly uncertain circumstances to finance Soviet grain purchases. Worries about Soviet sinan- cial accountability have caused commercial banks to hesitate on financing the $315m worth of credits that President George Bush has made avail- able immediately. Under the US government credit pro- gramme, 98 per cent of the grain purchase and 4.5 per cent of the interest is covered. The Soviets have been able to buy 100,000 tonnes of maize using their last credit remain- ing for 1990-91. Among the so-called \"soft\" commodity markets the Soviet Union has most impact on sugar. It is a significant pro- ducer, with just over 3m hect- ares sown to sugar beet, yield- ing about 9m tonnes of sugar. About half the industry is concentrated in the Ukraine, with another third in the Rus- sian Federation. The Ukraine trades sugar against oil from the Russian Federation. Mr Chris Pack, analyst with Czarnikow, the London trader, points out that Soviet beet yields are only three tonnes a hectare, compared with the EC's six to eight tonnes. \"Just a modern beet seed would improve things quite a bit,\" he says. The transportation system is The Soviet Union is still the world's biggest oil producer, although production has been slipping since the middle of 1988 as a result oft the natural decline in the western Siberia oil fields, and the general disruption of the economy and lack of Investment. In the first half of this year the decline in production accelerated, according to Mr Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst with County NatWest WoodMac, which revised its estimate for the first half down from 10.7m b/d to 10.2m b/d. The Soviet oil minister is predicting a simi- t lar figure, representing an 11 per cent fall on i the first half last year. About 90 per cent of t Soviet oil output comes from western a Siberia, in the Russian Federation. e Consumption within the Soviet Union has t fallen along with GNP, although Mr i MacLeod said it appears the country was 5 almost rationing itself in a move to keep t exports strong. About two thirds of exports e have traditionally come to the west, with the â remainder going to eastern Europe, which has borne the brunt of the decline. inefficient, and about 10 per cent of the crop disappears before it reaches the crushing factories, which are themselves old and run down. However, Soviet per capita consumption, at 42 kg, is sig- nificantly higher than the EC's 30 kg. Much of the extra sugar is used by the \"moonshine\" industry brewing illicit vodka, Mr Pack believes. Traditionally most of the annual Soviet deficit of about 4.5m tonnes has been filled by swapping oil for Cuban sugar. That trade is beginning to fal- ter, however, which could lead not only to the Cubans seeking new buyers, but also to the for- mer Soviet countries seeking new suppliers. Until two years ago the Soviet Union was among the Soviet cocoa bean grindings tOO tonnes 100 50 1979/80 82/384/586/788/990/1 world's leading consumers of cocoa but its bean grindings have since declined by 65 per cent to 70,000 tonnes, according to Gill & Duffus, the London trader. And Mr Tony Chad- wick, analyst with Prudential Bache, believes the figure could be even lower next year. While chocolate making is a big industry in the Soviet Union, employing many peo- ple, such a luxury product is bound to take a back seat behind bread-making wheat and sugar. Nevertheless, con- sumption figures are more likely to rise than fall as per- sonal spending power increases. The same can be said for cos- fee, another luxury. The great bulk of the Soviet Union's con- sumption of just over lm bags (60 kg each) consists of Indian robusta, which is traded for gas oil. For the minerals markets the Soviet Union's importance is as a supplier. In volume terms it is the world's leading producer of iron ore, lead, nickel, man- ganese and potash. Further- more, its output of copper, gold, diamonds, platinum, pal- ladium, rhodium and zinc are of global significance. So far the biggest impact of the Soviet search for foreign currency and its ability to divert materials from a sagging domestic economy has been felt in the traded metal mar- kets - those for copper, alu- minium, nickel, lead, zinc and tin. Uranium free market prices are also well below the cost of production because western traders are drawing on huge Soviet stockpiles - estimated to contain up to 200,000 tonnes, or four years of western requirements - to provide an alternative source of supply. Much of the Soviet mineral wealth is found in Siberia, part of the Russian Federation, but the high-grade manganese is found in Georgia. There are large iron ore deposits in the Ukraine as well as Russia, while Kazakhstan, the most industrialised of the Asian republics, has some lead and zinc mines and smelters as well as some aluminium smelt- ers. There is also a large alu- minium smelter (possibly with an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes) in Tajikistan in central Asia. Copper is found in Armenia and Kazakhstan as well as Russia. The Soviet Union has made its biggest mark in the west's traded metal markets with nickel, produced at Norilsk, on the Kola peninsula near the Finnish border. Nickel exports from the Soviet Union to the west nearly tripled in the 1980s and now account for about 15 per cent of western world supplies. The Soviet Union and its for- mer eastern bloc satellites have also been satisfying between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of western demand for copper and aluminium, enough to have a significant effect on prices when supplies were tight. As the Soviet economy went into reverse last year, however, its metal sales to the west - or in some cases its cuts in imports - had a profound impact on market balances and continued to weigh heavily on prices in the first half of 1991. The Metals & Minerals Research Services consultancy group suggests that the unex- pected flows from the eastern bloc are likely to send prices of metals traded on the London Metal Exchange (where world prices are determined) down by an average of 20 per cent this year, taking them close to their historic lows of 1986. Copper imports from the eastern bloc countries jumped from 140,000 to 250,000 tonnes last year and it was principally the sharp increase in these sales that prevented another shortfall in supplies. MMRS suggests that eastern bloc cop- per exports will rise to 310,000 tonnes this year. Soviet aluminium shipments to the west rose from 310,000 tonnes in 1989 to 450,000 tonnes last year and MMRS forecasts an increase to 650,000 tonnes. It says the lead market moved into a supply surplus last year Soviet Metal Production Base metals 1990 share of ('000 tones) world* total Aluminium 1,800 11% Copper 750 9% Lead 420 9% Nickel 275 12% Tin 16 8% Zinc 780 13% Precious (troy ounces) Gold 8m 14% Silver 45m 12% Platinum group metals 3.8m 45% 'excluding China because of a flood of Soviet material. In 1989 the eastern block imported 3,000 tonnes of lead. Last year it exported 8,000 tonnes and MMRS forecasts another 6,000 tonnes is on its way to the west this year. Nickel shipments from the Soviet Union had already reached a very high level and showed only a marginal increase, from 95,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes, last year. MMRS believes there will be another slight rise, to 105,000 tonnes this year. It says the continued absence of Soviet buying of refined tin \"has delayed the point at which the market approaches some form of equi- librium\". The former Comecon countries imported no tin last year after taking 9,000 tonnes in 1989. There was also a complete reversal in trade in zinc last year - Comecon imports of 4,000 tonnes in 1989 were replaced by exports of 4,000 tonnes and exports could be near this level again in 1991. There must be doubts about whether the Soviet Union can maintain metals output because most of its smelting and refining capacity has been deteriorating while the finance required for expansion has been limited. By western standards the Soviet metals industry is grossly inefficient and also a terrible polluter. In the past 18 months copper plants in Armenia and the Urals have been closed for environmental reasons. The aluminium smelter in Kanaker in Armenia was shut down as long ago as 1984 and the Sumgait alumin- ium smelter in Azerbaijan was closed this summer. A Scandinavian group, led by Outokumpu of Finland, has been putting together a scheme to upgrade the six nickel smelt- ers owned by the Norilsk Com- binat on the Kola peninsula, i the biggest producer of this metal in the world - and also one of the world's great polluters. Norilsk also produces nearly all the Soviet Union's platinum group metals. All three metals are essential in some automo- tive anti-pollution catalysts and the Soviet Union last year sold in the west about 580,000 troy ounces of platinum, 150,000 ounces of rhodium and 1.66m ounces of palladium. That represented about 50 per cent of the west's palladium needs, 20 per cent for platinum and 40 per cent for rhodium. \"A 'meltdown in Soviet pre- cious metals mining would impact the rhodium price first,\" says Mr Andy Smith, analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland. \"Not only are the Soviets dominant suppliers, just below South Africa, but also Soviet stocks are probably low. Rhodium comes out of the end of the platinum group met- als refining process, so ineffi- ciencies along the production chain would hit rhodium the hardest.\" The Soviets certainly loom larger in the platinum group metals markets than in gold but the country aimed to earn between $2.5bn and $3bn of for- eign currency a year from gold sales, according to Mr Timothy Green, an independent analyst and author of several books on the metal. To do so it has sold an annual 6m to 8m ounces. Mr Green says that annual sales of up to llm ounces of gold can now be expected. Most analysts believe that the Soviet Union will resist dis- tress sales of its gold, which it needs to retain in reserves to provide some credibility for its currency. However, they become nervous about the fate of possibly 8m ounces out on swap in the west (sold but with a promise to buy back at an agreed future date) should the cash to buy the metal back not be available."

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR finished little changed in London foreign exchange trading yesterday, while maintaining a soft undertone. It fell to a low of DM1.6875, but rallied after climbing back through DM1.6900 in a technical reac- tion to the selling seen on Mon- day and last Friday. In the second quarter of the year the US current account surplus narrowed to $2.97bn from a revised $10.50bn in the first quarter, but this was widely expected. A high figure for the first quarter was largely the result of payments from allies to defray US costs in the Gulf war. Payments fell during the second quarter, but the figures showed the first consecutive quarterly sur- pluses since 1982. This data was not expected to produce any fundamental movement in the dollar how- ever, with the market waiting to see whether this week's inflation news encourages the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy. US producer prices for August will be pub- lished tomorrow, followed by consumer prices on Friday. As expected the Fed added reserves to the New York banking system yesterday, via $2.5bn of customer repurchase agreements, but this was a technical move and did not sig- nal an easing of policy.

At the London close the dol- lar eased to DM1.6945 from DM1.6955; to Y134.80 from Y134.90; to SFrl.4800 from SFr1.4890; and to FFr5.7600 from FFr5.7650. Its index fell to 65.3 from 65.4. Sterling showed little overall movement, but looked vulnera- ble to political and interest rate factors. Dealers pointed out that another cut of %' point in UK bank base rates would bring levels down to not far above equivalent German rates. This may be acceptable in the event of an early UK gen- eral election, if it increases the lead of the ruling Conservative party in opinion polls. But if there is not an election until next year the market is likely to grow increasingly nervous about the political risk in hold- ing sterling at a time when there is little interest rate pre- iium.

   "text_content" : "THERE WAS a slight firming of wholesale interest rates in London yesterday as sterling traded nervously against the D-Mark and speculation faded about a UK general election in November. A surprisingly large fall in August UK producer prices encouraged hopes of another cut in bank base rates, but had little impact on wholesale rates. Three-month sterling inter- bank rose to 10%-10%/ from lO-101O per cent and 12-month money was quoted at 10%'-10 compared with 10&-10 per cent Short sterling futures opened weaker on Uffe, but finished UK edlmig ga m e. a f im *am IUap Wr 4. 11 towards the top of the day's range, supported by the producer price index.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street SHARE PRICES succumbed to heavy selling pressure yester- day after long-term yields had risen in the absence of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was back well below the 3,000 mark at 2,982.56, down 24.60 on the day. The more broadly based Stan- dard & Poor's 500 also ended weaker, down 4.03 at 384.54, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks dropped 6.79 to 511.28. Turn- over on the NYSE was light at 146m shares. The Dow's fall below 3,000 was an indication of the under- lying bearish mood of the mar- ket. Many analysts had pre- dicted the index would stay above 3,000 for the long term, aided by improved economic conditions and recovering cor- porate profits. However, the economy continues to struggle and company earnings are unlikely to show any signifi- cant improvements when the third quarter reporting season opens next month. Although a cut in interest rates may help sentiment in the short term, there is still a I to marked absence of buying iter- incentives in the market. had Among individual issues, an H J Heinz dropped $2%/ to eral $38'% on turnover of 1.5m rick shares in spite of an appar- ently strong first fiscal quarter mes showing. The food group's lack profits of $254.4m during the E at reporting period, however, day. owed much to a one-off gain of tan- $221m from the sale of Heinz's ided Iowa corn milling operation. 1.54, The underlying picture e of showed weak sales in the quar- cks ter, partly because of reduced urn- unit volume and the negative it at impact of a strong dollar on overseas earnings. 1,000 AT&T slipped $% to $37% der- after the telecommunications nar- group announced it would be pre- offering new business dis- ;tay counts for international calls. ,rm, Sallie Mae, the student loan mic marketing body, fell $2% to cor- $62% after Morgan Stanley the made cautious comments on ggle the stock, citing a draft bill in are Congress that could make Sal- nifi- lie Mae obsolete. Among tech- the nology stocks Compaq dropped ison $1%/ to $33% in active trading amid both good and bad news. !st The sector analyst at Oppen- in heimer cut his rating on the la stock in anticipation of weak ag earnings in the third quarter, but conversely there were ,s, reports that Compaq plans to to unveil a new line of personal im computers next Monday. ar- On the over-the-counter mar* *er ket, Collagen slumped $1% to )'s $14% on turnover of 1.4m he shares on fears that tomor- Ã½r, row's Congressional hearings of into enforcement practices at z's the Food and Drug Administra- tion will create more bad pub- re licity for the company. ed Canada ve on TORONTO share prices ended the session lower in moderate /% trading. ns Based on preliminary data, be the composite index fell 30.81 is- to close at 3,448.15.

   "text_content" : "MOST BOURSES eased again yesterday, with sentiment in the late-closers further depressed by an early fall on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw more fall! in banks, relative strength in chemicals and another flurry in steels as the DAX index losi another 3.94 to 1,629.12 after a 4.89 decline to 673.48 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM3.2bn to DM3.4bn. Bayernhypo and Bayernver ein fell DM5 to DM349 and DM7.50 to DM398. Commerz bank shed another DM3.50 tc DM245. Mr Robert Law, bank ing analyst at Shearson Leh man, thought little of the argu ment surrounding the quality of Soviet debt, and said that the banks, among the most liq uid stocks in the market, were easy to sell in a period of ner. vous, thin trading. The big three chemicals rose by a matter of pfennings. In steels, Hoesch put on another DM5.20 to DM310.70 and Klock. ner-Werke, talked about last week as a potential marriage partner for Hoesch, ended DM2 higher at DM148. MILAN failed to get any sup. port from yesterday's delayed settlement of the August account. Investors were con- cerned that the forthcoming interim results season would be disappointing. After the close, worries about the economy were heightened by news that the Italian industrial employers' association, Confindustria, had lowered its forecast for gross domestic product growth in 1991 to 0.8 per cent, down from 1 per cent at mid-year and less than half the government fore cast.

Generall fell L325 to L29,650 ahead of the launch of its giant L1.75 trillion rights issue next week. PARIS drifted lower as Wall Street weakened in early trad- ing. Turnover remained light after Monday's FFrl.4bn, as the CAC 40 index fell 15.41 to 1,840.47. In the banking sector, CCF, which gained FFr4.50 on take- over rumours on Monday, closed 70 centimes down at FFr179.30, after rising to a day's high of FFr182 and sink- ing to a low of FFr178. Volume in the stock was less than half Monday's level, but still rela- tively heavy at 140,460 shares. The bourse authorities said that Cassa Risparmio di Tor- ino, the Turin-based savings bank, had raised its stake in CCF voting rights to 5.51 per cent from 4.8 per cent, but CCF said this was not connected with the recent speculative activity. Bouygues, the construction group, bucked the trend, rising FFr14 to FFr582. Saur Afrique, its subsidiary, has won a 15- year contract to distribute water in the Central African Republic. Arjomari-Prioux, the paper group, fell FFr85 to FFr2,215 after cautious comments on the second half by the UK's Arjomari Wiggins Appleton. ZURICH was depressed by Wall Street's lower opening, and the Credit Suisse index fell 3.5 to 529.7. Industrials were pressured by the weaker dol- lar; in chemicals, Sandoz bear- ers dropped SFr60 to SFr2,360 and Roche bearers by SFrl30 to SFr7,800. Bearers in the brewery, Sibra, dropped SFr50 to SFr405. Another brewer, Feldschlds- schen said it had taken a sub- stantial stake in Sibra. Feld- schl6sschen bearers eased SFr30 to SFr3,350. AMSTERDAM was dragged lower by the weaker dollar and Wall Street. The CBS Tendency index closed at 92.2, down 0.2, in thin trading. Volmac Soft- ware put on 80 cents to FP 18.30 after reporting a 36 per cent drop in first-half net profits. Some analysts had been expecting a loss. BRUSSELS closed lower in thin trading. The BeI20 index fell 6.76 to 1,123.46. The steel cord and steel wire producer, Bekaert, fell to BFr9,620 before closing BFrI40 lower at BFr9,750 in the wake of Monday's announcement of a sharp fall in first-half profit. STOCKHOLM reversed an early loss on demand for Volvo and Astra. The AffirsvArlden General index rose 10.3 to 1,074.1 in turnover of SKr336m after Monday's SKr283m. Volvo free Bs rose SKr1O to SKr365 while Astra free Bs added SKrl2 to SKr568."

   "text_content" : "OGINTINlA stood head and shoulders above other emerging stock *- markets in August, as it was e propelled to record highs by k foreign and domestic enthusi- r, asm for the government's eco- e nomic reforms. * According to figures from i the International Finance Cor- poration, part of the World r- Bank, Argentina jumped 103 o per cent in dollar terms last a month, producing a rise of 262 .- per cent. so far this year and a overtaking Brazil as the best it performing market of 1991. i- The record-breaking rally - has been accompanied by a large rise in turnover, reflecting foreign investment and flight capital returning. Daily turnover reached a d record high of $116m in e August, compared with aver- age daily turnover of between I, $3m and $6m last February and 1 just $200,000 six years ago. g Average daily turnover this I month has settled back to I- around $30m to $40m. e The stock market has under- [- gone a correction of about 8 a per cent in the last week, but analysts believe that this I week's landslide victory for the y ruling Peronist party in the i gubernatorial and mid-term i congressional elections will push the market higher again. Baring Securities director Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton says the government's plan to generate greater income from Industry will have a positive long-term effect on the stock market. A reduction in capital gains tax and in corporate tax is expected to coax Argentine companies into giving a truer reflection of their profits, and lead to a closer proximity to US accounting principles. Furthermore, a prolonged period of accelerated deprecia. tion means that the asset value of many Argentine companies far exceeds the stated balance sheet value. Mr Campbell- Lamerton estimates that many Argentine share prices are trading at only 70 per cent of their book value, suggesting that a further rerating of the stock market is likely. Last month's worst per- former was Indonesia, which fell 14.3 per cent in dollar terms, bringing its drop so far this year to 30.1 per cent. The market was already suffering in July after the government's first shot at privatisation flopped badly. In August, long-suffering investors were confronted by dismal interim results.

The main cause of the disap- pointing half-year figures has been the government's decision to keep interest rates high as part of its quest to eradicate inflation. Furthermore, with interest rates at 23 per cent and inflation around 9 per t cent, investors have been sell- ing equities to take advantage of the hefty real returns s offered by bank deposits. a In the past year Indonesia s has seen its price/earnings e multiple tumble from the high i teens to single digits. Mr Bates t says that, while the market r may fall another 4 to 5 per cent in the next few weeks, several companies now look good value, especially those involved with the govern- ment's infrastructure pro- gramme. But he warns that there are still many aggrieved investors around and it may take time for the large lines of stock to disappear.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo ARBITRAGE-related activity dominated share price move- ments yesterday as the Nikkei average fell on selling ahead of the September futures settle- ment this Friday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 162.40 off at 22,411.58, after a high of 22,612.43 and low of 22,355.54. Volume was unchanged at 300m shares as institutional investors held the sidelines. Declines led rises by 679 to 256 with 184 issues unaltered. The Topix index of all first sec- tion stocks lost 9.74 to 1,748.84, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.02 to 1,321.18. Prices remained volatile as some arbitrageurs unwound their positions against Septem- ber futures. Market partici- pants have been nervous about this week's settlement, but Miss Betty Wu at SBCI said positions were also being rolled over into December futures. Profit-taking was seen in interest rate-sensitive stocks, which surged last week on hopes of an imminent discount rate cut. Declines in short-term yields encouraged rallies in the financial markets last week, but the Bank of Japan reiter- ated yesterday that, while Japan's economy was slowing, it was still strong. Overnight unsecured call rates rose by 9 basis points to 6.9 per cent. The central bank was seen draining reserves from the money markets on technical factors. Analysts now believe that the Bank of Japan will try to influence money market rates, rather than reduce the discount rate, to implement monetary policy. Interest rate-sensitive large- capital shares lost ground. Nip- pon Steel retreated Y6 to Y420. Pharmaceutical-related issues were stronger as the Japan Cancer Association started its conference. Meiji Seika, the day's most active issue, surged Y45 to Y974 on speculation that it would announce a new antibiotic at the conference. Yakult Honsha, the beverage company, added Y70 at Y2,060 on its new cancer drug, and Nippon Kayaku gained Y18 to Y891. Dia Kensetsu and Daiwa Construction, the two con- struction companies which held a joint press conference on Monday to deny bankruptcy rumours, continued to fall. The former shed Y290 to Y1,360 and the latter dropped its daily limit of Y300 to Y820. Traders said the press conference had made market participants more wary. Nippon Carbon closed unchanged at Y1,470 after hit- in ting a record high of Y1,550. ji. Investors looking for re short-term profits have been in buying the stock on rumours Id of speculative interest. at In Osaka, the OSE average a, dipped 68.79 to 24,901.73 on vol- id ume of 65.6m shares. er Ono Pharmaceutical gained ;u Y240 to Y3,760 on afternoon reports that the Ministry of ra Health and Welfare had n- authorised the company to sell :h a new diabetic drug. :y Roundup ie id A QUIET day in the Pacific ly Rim saw most markets move rs slightly lower. id AUSTRALIA eased on weak ts corporate earnings, an appreci- ating currency, some poor d results from Commonwealth it- Bank and a lifeless US market. The All Ordinaries index lost 6.5 to 1,558.1 in turnover up from A$105m to A$142m. Commonwealth Bank, which makes its market debut tomor- row, said after the close that net operating profits had fallen by 45 per cent in 1990/91 to A$272m after bad and doubtful debt provisions. MANILA finished above the day's lows on bargain hunting. The composite index, down 4.4 per cent on Monday, ended 12.14 lower at 946.61 in a ses- sion shortened to allow traders to join a demonstration in favour of a pact extending the US military presence in the Phillipines. Turnover shrank to 100m pesos from 143m. PLDT, the telecommunica- tions company, closed a net 35 pesos down at 527.50 pesos, after reaching a low for the day of 522.50 and high of 530. HONG KONG rose in cau- tious trading. The Hang Seng index gained 18.73 to 3,959.27 in turnover of about HK$1.12bn, up from HK$1.06bn. Jardine Matheson, with interim results due next week, put on 75 cents to HK$32. TAIWAN fluctuated within a narrow range. The previous day's credit easing by the cen- tral bank had been discounted. The weighted index rose 14.28 to 4,722.08 in turnover of T$20bn, down from T$29bn. KUALA LUMPUR declined in thin trading. The composite index fell 6.56 to 552.60 in vol- ume of 29m shares, down from 40m. Business was also slug- gish in SINGAPORE. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 1.54 to 1,419.46. Volume remained steady at 27m shares."

   "text_content" : "By Tery Byland, UK Stock Market Editor SHARE PRICES continued to slide in London yesterday as the stock market braced itself for the profits statement, and a possible rights issue, from British Aerospace. An attempt to rally from an early fall of nearly 23 points on the FT-SE scale was thwarted by a weak start to the new Wall Street session, emphasised by selling of Glaxo, the pharmaceutical leader due to report profits today. Optimism on the economic front was heightened by confi- dent comments from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who said that the economy is \"back on course\", although the effects on the market were counter-balanced by his move to cool election speculation. News of a slowdown in pro- ducer price momentum joined SSep Sep 16 Sep 30 Sep12 Sep 26 Oct 10 t L-se Ohig S Sep13 Sep27 Oct 11 S Sep23 Oct 7 Oct 21 tf *m s- ssbiMee da, ama-w I Monday's upward revision of s domestic retail sales in but- tressing underlying confidence c in equities. The market, how- ever, remained prey to short 2 term factors, and the institu tions were largely intent on s keeping out of the way until e the current round of rights e issue hints and this week's heavy list of corporate results have been unwound. The FT-SE Index closed 22.4 down at 2,630.8, only just above the day's low point. Trading volume increased to 467.1m shares fron Monday's 45.8m. Intra-market business provided . a substantial proportion of yes- terday's deals and the institu- - tions again picked up stock by way of share placings rather - than by competing in the open market. A block o7f %m shares in British Steel was placed f close to the market price and * 2m in BET were also placed, i with both blocks apparently * going into institutional hands. t The contrast between the near peak levels of equity mar- i ket indices and the still poor I trading volume was reflected i yesterday in new hints that a i senior, well-known name in the Sstockbrokng world was on the brink of withdrawing from the I London market. British Aerospace stock fell aahin. blthough by considera- y lemra than on Monday when the board warned the City egarding today's pr-ta new- a The Footsie Index was also draggedback towards the end of me aessaon by a heavy set- back in Glaxo. US sellers hit the pharmaceutical concern hard towards the London close, when the Dow Industrial Aver- age was down 24 points to below the 3,000 mark, which has proved a stumbling block for US equities over the past few months. However, with the US dollar less active yesterday, falls in the UK blue chip interna- tionals were mostly small Oil issues, in spite of the Wall Street weakness, steadied to close with trifling losses on the day.

Equity strategists continued t to express a diversity of views i on equities, with most suggest ing that progmr esmay be less dramatic than over the past D month. Barclays de Zoete i Wedd believes that the recov- k ery in corporate earnings has t now begun to \"ustify the pre- miums that have been paid for r it\". The firm has increased its s earnings per share growth esti- mate for next year from 10 per I cent to 15 per cent.

   "text_content" : "PHARMACEUTICALS giant Glaxo saw one of the steepest falls among Footsie stocks. The drop of 41 to 1325p on turnover of 2.2m - heavy for the stock - was prompted by profit-tak- ing in the US market and also by the weakness of the dollar. There was also talk that some traders had been mark- ing down the share price in London in the hope of generat- ing business. This was coupled with speculation that US secu- rities house Wertheim Schro- der had cut its profits forecast for the company. Dr Jonathan Gelles, of Wert- heim, firmly denied the rumours. He said: \"We have sold some stock for some cli- ents but in no way, shape or form have we downgraded our view on Glaxo. Our price tar- get is at the very least Â£21 in two years' time.\" Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura Research said there had been switching from Glaxo into Fisons (up 9 at 510p). Beazer doubts The market gave an emphatic thumbs down to what will be the final prelimi- nary results from the Beazer group; today Beazer is sched- uled to reveal the pathfinder prospectus for the flotation of C.H. Beazer, comprising the non-US interests of the group that include the highly rated UK housebuilding division. Beazer's profits figure, Â£60.6m, was broadly in line with market estimates, but included Â£14.9m for the release of fair value provision, which perplexed building sector spe- cialists. The market was addi- tionally unsettled by the 4p dividend total when a figure of 5p had been pencilled in. The Beazer share price, pushed up to 100p in recent days as the latest cut in UK interest rates focused market attention on the recovery pros- pects for housebuilders, fell to 86p before stabilising and clos- ing a net 6 off at 89p. Turnover was 2m shares. Trafalgar upset Construction group Trafal- gar House made a weak show- ing after at least one securities house lowered its profits fore- cast. The shares closed 16 down at 229p on 3.4m traded. Institutional broker James Capel cut its estimate for the company's full-year profits to Â£100m from Â£115m. An analyst at Capel said the downgrade was prompted by concern over the general dullness of the property sector, in which Trafalgar is involved, and the group's exposure to Brel, the troubled UK railway rolling stock manufacturer. There was speculation that Hoare Govett had also down- graded. Mr David Ireland of Hoare said it was unlikely that the company would announce profits of less than Â£120m. He confirmed, however, that after talking to Trafalgar on Monday he had reduced his 1992 fore- cast by Â£10m to Â£180m. The shares were further affected by adverse press comment yesterday on the sale of 1m \"A\" shares by Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of Trafal- gar House. Arjo Wiggins down Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper group, dropped 17 to 272p after warn- ing that trading would be diffi- cult in the UK during the sec- ond half and that conditions were likely to worsen in Europe. At 9.2m shares, turn- over was heavy. The 4.7 per cent decline in interim profits to Â£135.5m was in line with most analysts' forecasts, although full-year estimates were shaded down after the company's warning. Hoare Govett, for example, now expects Â£250m against Â£262m. However, the shares moved off their low as the market digested the news that Arjo was back in talks over the sale of Soporcel, of Portugal, in which it holds a 43 per cent stake. The rise in group operat- ing profit margins from 10.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent also provided support. Speculation that the heavily capitalised health and house- hold sector of the stock market may be reclassified by the Stock Exchange hit Reckitt & Colman. It was believed that Reckitt's weighting would be changed if it ceased to be clas- sified alongside pharmaceuti- cals companies and the shares fell 17 to 679p. However, after the Stock Exchange met late yesterday, a spokesman said the reclassifi- cation would affect Stock Exhange groupings but not the FT-A indices. There has also been talk that Unilever (up 5 at 769p) would join one of the newly classified sectors and thus increase its weighting. This is not the case. Turnover in British Steel rose to 19m as the shares fol- lowed the market trend and eased a penny to 121%p. S.G.Warburg accounted for a large part of the day's trade. It is believed that the broker bought some 8.5m shares at 118.5p and sold the majority of its purchase at 119.5p in two blocks, one of 5.6m shares and another of 1.9m. British Aerospace remained in the doldrums following Mon- day's profits warning. The shares fell 19 to 499p at one stage. What one trader, how- ever, called \"brave bargain hunters\" helped the shares rally to close a net 10 off at 508p on turnover of 2.6m as the market eagerly awaited today's interim results and news of the long anticipated rights issue. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court said. \"The company will be hard pushed to come up FT-A AllIShare Index 130 125 120 115 Equity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Intra-mak tbusness & Ovrsetunover 600 400 200 0 with explanations to let the bulls have a run.\" Bid target Invergordon Dis- tillers added 10 at 269p ahead of today's half-time results on talk that the Â£286m offer from Whyte and Mackay may have to be increased. Analysts expect around Â£30m interim profits. There was heavy two-way trading in all three Racal stocks throughout the session. Some 10m Racal Electronics changed hands, with the shares closing 1% off at 234p. A similar volume was seen in Racal \"Special Ex\", which ended unaltered on balance at 42p, having risen from the 34p mark at which they com- menced trading a week last Monday. Turnover in the \"Special Ex\" stock has been consistently heavy since the Stock Exchange granted the shares an official listing prior to the September 16 demerger of Racal Telecom from Racal Electronics. After the demerger Racal Telecom will be renamed Voda- sone. Racal Telecom retreated 5 to 337p, unsettled by a bearish note issued by Robert Fleming Securities. Mr Laurence Hey- worth at Fleming said the risks facing Vodafone would include regulation from Oftel, the tele- coms industry watchdog, and from the European Commu- nity, intra-European tariff comparisons and increased international competition for cellular franchises. Fleming acknowledged the possibility of a bid being made after the demerger increases the num- ber of shares available, but it expects to see the stock trade below 300p in coming months. The heaviest activity in the insurance area of the market was in Royals, which fell 7 to 391p as turnover reached an unusually large 5.1m shares. The stock was depressed, deal- ers said, by talk of a big profits downgrade and bearish analy- sis of the group's mortgage indemnity business by one of the leading UK brokerages. Son Alliance, another leader in the mortgage indemnity business, suffered for the same reason, closing 6 off at 370p, albeit on much thinner turn- over of 1.6m. Commercial Union benefited from switch- ing out of Royals and Sun Alli- ance, firming 2 to 517p. BTR was firm ahead of a series of presentations planned by the company. The shares improved 2 to 428p in the morning and held their price as securities house Hoare Govett hosted a meeting with more than 100 institutional cli- ents in London yesterday. MB-Caradon lost 8 to 262p, pushed down by a large plac- ing, believed to be with an institution, of more than 2m shares dealt at 260p. Worsted spinner John Hag- gas jumped 12 to 70p after post- ing full-year profits more than doubled to Â£1.8m accompanied by a confident statement.

   "text_content" : "MUCH OF the equity futures' lead over the stock market evaporated yesterday as ner- vousness about the domestic political scene and a poor per- formance by Wall Street depressed the market, writes Jim McCallum. The September FT-SE 100 index contract fell faster than the spot index and by the close its premium had contracted to just 10 points against a high of 20 earlier in the session. With fair value calculated at 10 points the futures market is currently not signalling any gains by the stock market before the end of the month. This is partly accounted for by the unwinding of large share trades hedged in the futures market - with inves- tors selling futures and buying shares. But there was also unease after the stock mar- ket's recent strong gains. The September FT-SE closed at 2,642.5, down 29 points on the day. In the traded options mar- ket, dealing levels picked up slightly, with BP leading the way. The larger trades included the sale of 3,000 April 330 puts and the purchase of over 1,000 January 390 calls. Sears December 100 and 80 calls were active. A buyer of 500 Rolls-Royce December 140 calls and 300 December 130 calls also lifted turnover.",

   "text_content" : "After stunmbling in 1991, world car sales are forecast to )T f *recover in 1992, but ad producers and their suppliers face unprecedented challenges through the 1990s. Kevin Done looks at growing trade conflicts as Japan consolidates its position in the US and Europe 'I `i I CAR MAKERS in North America, Europe and Japan are operating in an increas- ingly harsh financial climate. They face heavy losses particu- larly in the US, where they are assailed by fere, competition and recessio - In Europe thel'p'ttern of demand is prepriously bal- anced. -Sveral volume markets led by the. UK, Spain and France, have been scored deeply by plunging sales. In stark contrast, record demand in Germany fuelled by unifica- tion, has created an unprece- dented order backlog, with which car makers have been unable to keep pace. However, the German industry is warn- ing that demand can hardly continue much longer at such overheated levels.. Sales have :weakened in Japan after several years of buoyant giobwth an'the profits of some leading Japanese car makers are slipping, although they have still to confront problems on the scale of their American and European rivals. The US big three, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, were all deep in loss in the first half of the year. After stumbling in 1991, worlA car sales are forecast to stage a recovery in 1992, but h car produders and their suppli- n ers still face unprecedented ,- and expensive challenges i. through the 1990s. i- U Environmental regulations e are being toughened with n costly demands for still-lower exhaust emissions, while regu- if lations governing improved I- fuel economy and the recycling a of old cars appear unavoidable. d m Recent regulatory develop- d ments in the US virtually n ensure the electric car will d play an increasingly important i- role on the roads of North e- America, and probably the h world, before the decade's end. n Twelve US states are now r, considering following Calif- i- ornia into adopting stringent y clean air legislation, part of h which would require \"zero emission vehicles\" (ZEVs) to n form a small but increasing )f proportion of car makers' total ts sales from the late 1990s. ir U The most dynamic long-term h growth in car sales is forecast it for markets where many of ir today's leading car makers are s. barely represented - in east- il ern Europe and in Asia (exclu- r, ding Japan). The opening up of it such markets is happening against a background of con- 1, siderable political and eco- vo nomic uncertainty, heighten- It ing the investment risks. cat makes' pikinÂ¶ polcs in dÂ· omnt maretr * uthlreani - ig to udermitne the indus try's longtanding selective distribution system and could lead to a revolution in the 1990s in the way cars are retaled. * The pace of new model development led by the Japa- nese appears to be remorseless. As model life cycles are reduced the battle by European and US makers to match the leading \"lean\" producers is intensifying. The gap in pro- ductivity, efficiency and qual- ity between the world's leading car makers remains alarming, however, as the battle takes on a global dimension. a The focus of Japanese com- petition is moving to Europe, where the spectre of overcapa- city, already a reality in North America, looms as Japanese car makers establish their first wave of transplant (local assembly plant) facilities. The inexorable rise of the Japanese car makers in North Amrlca: and in Europe is ,gai fuelling trade conflicts as ,proteoCInist pressures grow, ii lyinthe US. The big three US car makeqr have broken with traditionmby Joining forces to lobby the US government about the woes being suffered by the domestic car industry. Earlier this year Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, Mr Harold Poling. chairman of Ford, and Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman f. Chrysler; made a joint lobb lbg visit to Washington for the first time in nearly a decade. In a letter to President George Bush, Mr Iacocca claimed the domestic US car industry was \"confront- ing a serious problem that threatens our survival\". Apparently to little avail, the US car producers have sought a \"temporary market share standstill\" for Japanese car makers in the US, where their share has now reached around 30 per cent. Mr Iacocca has voiced the concern that the Japanese share in the US could reach \"40 per cent or more unless they exercise some kind of restraint. \"At a Japanese share of 40 per cent in a depressed indus- try Chrysler is gone and Ford could be mortally wounded from a competitive stand- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ,1' Can Ow new VW Gol remain Europe's best-seller... point,\" said Mr Iacocca. \"Even GM is at risk unless and until we decide as a nation that a domestic auto industry is a strategically important indus- try and should not be allowed to fall victim to Japan's indus- trial strategy of targeting key industries.\" The big three have inflamed the debate by filing dumping charges against Japanese mini van imports into the US, and similar charges could follow against Japanese luxury cars. In Europe, Japan and the European Community have recently ended their prolonged wrangling over trade n cars in the single European market after 1992, but scepticism remains on how the agreement reached at the end of July will work in practice, and whether the market will in fact be fully liberalised after 1999. Interpretations of the deal among EC member states are already far apart with the UK insisting that it sets absolutely no limit on the build-up of Jap- ahese assembly capacity in Europe, while protectionist voices in France and Italy claim privately that safeguards have been agreed. A process of six monthly monitoring of Japanese auto in. mpeon wIU me now OpelVeuxhell Aer? exports to the EC, beginning in 1993, has been accepted by Brussels and Tokyo. The moni- toring is to be conducted throughout the planned seven- year transition to a liberalised market It is likely to provide fertile ground for repetition of the protectionist debate, as the perception grows of the dam- age being inflicted on the Euro- pean motor industry by Increasing Japanese sales and the expanding Japanese share of the European market. While the 1980s was the decade in which the Japanese car makers concentrated on building their production pres- ence in North America, the 1990s is the decade in which they are switching their atten- tion to Europe. Nissan has been producing cars in the UK since 1966. Vol- umes were modest at first, but this year output should reach 120,000 cars and will grow to 220,000 in 1992/93. Next year production begins at Toyota and Honda's first European car assembly plants - both located in the UK, which Mr Jacques Calvet, the protectionist chair- man of Peugeot of France, has variously called \"a Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe\" and \"Japan's fifth largest island\". Honda also owns 20 per cent of Rover, the UK car maker. Late last month Mitsubishi Motors finalised a deal with Volvo of Sweden and the Dutch state, to create a joint venture in the Netherlands with the aim of producing 200,000 cars a year in the second half of the 1990s. Suzuki is established in Spain and is planning to assemble cars in Hungary, which leaves only Mazda of the leading Japanese car makers still to arrange its entry into manufacturing in Europe. As a harbinger of another line of attack Honda and Mit- subishi Motors have started this year to ship cars to Europe from assembly plants estab- lished in the US in the 1980s. Japanese car makers have around 11.6 per cent of the total western European mar- ket, but what they can achieve in unprotected European mar- kets without a domestic pro- ducer is already evident. While they captured a 5.1 per cent share of the \"restricted\" Euro- pean markets last year, they controlled more than 30 per cent of the \"open markets\". With a disturbing competi- tive advantage in manufactur- ing productivity, the effective- ness of new model develop- ment and the speed and vari- ety of new model offerings they pose a formidable challenge.",

   "text_content" : "WORLDWIDE new car sales are expected to decline by 3.3 per cent this year to 34.4m from 35.6m in 1990, the sharp- est downturn since the second oil shock caused sales to col- lapse in 19860. According to the world auto- motive forecast report by DRI/ McGraw Hill', new car demand in the previously strong mar- kets of western Europe and Japan will drop by 2.2 and 3.2 per cent respectively, while new car sales in North Amer- ica are likely to fall for the third successive year, this time by 7 per cent. DRI suggests the depression in the world industry is likely to lift towards the end of 1991, however, as the rapid resolu- tion of the Gulf crisis leads to a gradual recovery in business and consumer confidence. It forecasts global car sales will grow by almost 5 per cent in 1992 with further steady growth averaging 3.3 per cent a year from 1993 to 1995. The downturn in western Europe, which has already had a severe impact on the profit- ability of several leading Euro- pean car makers, has been soft- ened by the strength of car sales in Germany in the wake of re-unification. In 1991 car registrations in former East Germany are included in the western Euro- pean figures for the first time and thus have a distorting effect on the market. Without sales in eastern Ger- many, DRI suggests new car registrations in western Europe would be 4.3 per cent lower this year than in 1990. Excluding Germany, western European sales are likely to be around 8 per cent lower this year. According to the DRI fore- cast, the surge in new car sales in Germany will weaken signif- icantly in the second half of the year, and sales in western Germany are forecast to fall by around 6 per cent in 1992 before recovering in 1993-95. After the \"disastrous\" decline in UK new car sales in 1990 and 1991, with short-term prospects having weakened since the Budget, DRI suggests that sales could recover to around 1.9m next year in what' will probably be an election year. The 1992 total would still be the second lowest since 1987, however. DRI says that the recovery in the UK will be slow with the return to a 2.2m market not expected before 1994 at the ear- liest.

The depression In the Industry Is likely to lift at the end of 1991 In spite of the present dip in worldwide vehicle demand, in a longer perspective sales and production are still set for strong growth according to the World Vehicle Market Strate- gic Review And Forecast Data- book2, an ambitious study pub- lished last month by Euromotor Reports. It forecasts -hat worldwide motor vehicle saes will jump by more than 50 per cent in the next 20 years to reach 74.7m in 2010 com- pared with the 49.3m vehicles sold last year. According to the report, nearly a third of the growth or 8m units would be accounted for by the net increase in sales in the Asian region, excluding g Japan. Asian vehicle sales will e approach 12m units in 2010, an * increase of almost 200 per cent o from 1990 levels. i) The most remarkable growth rates are forecast for South - Korea, where annual vehicle r sales are forecast to rise to i, 3.4m in 2010 from 977,000 last i year. The study says that sales it in South Korea will accelerate ; at such a rate that the national ,t vehicle fleet will jump from 3.2m in 1990 to 24.8m in 2010. The next most important Asian market will be China, where sales in 2010 are forecast to total 2.6m, a 243 per cent increase from 1990. As in South Korea, these sales will chiefly be met by domestically pro- n duced vehicles, creating n \"immense\" demands for 1 vehicle design and tooling ser- r vices, claims the Euromotor ke Report. - Strong growth is also fore- a- cast in eastern Europe where b- annual vehicle sales volumes y are expected to show an a increase of 4.3m units in the Le next 20 years compared with a n rise of 4m in western Europe. . With vehicle sales rising from .- 3.8m units in 1990 to 8.1m in a 2010, the eastern European region is set to be come a very t, important motor vehicle mar- ar ket. The study forecasts sales d in western Europe in the same a period climbing from 14.9m in g 1990 to 18.9m in 2010. * Hitherto, motorisation has been a phenomenon of the * western world. ast year west- Sern markets accounted for 79 U per cent of all vehicle sales and 7 76 per cent of the world vehicle 0 fleet for only 15 per cent of the 2 world population, says the 2 study. 7 It forecasts that the less developed countries will gain a massively in importance as 3 vehicle markets grow in the * next 20 years. 7 The outlook for 2010 is for 7 more than a third of the - world's vehicle sales (35.5 per cent) to be made in the less developed countries, more than 6 triple the share they had in a 1960. 7 The report says that sales 4 rates of vehicles in the less 4 developed countries are lag- a ging those in the more devel- e oped countries by around 85 3 years. The more developed 4 countries absorbed 13m 5 vehicles in 1960, a demand 5 level that will be reached in I the less developed countries in a 1995. 4 The report warns western - car makers to. maintain and a build their strategic positions \" in the less developed countries 11 as \"by far the majority of the n rising demand in the less it developed nations will be met by local assembly and or man- h ufacture\". h In the more developed coun- e tries, car sales in the next 20 o years are forecast to increase it by 40 per cent and commercial *s vehicle sales by 62 per cent. a The study warns that the i numbers of vehicles needing to n be scrapped in 2010 will be \"immense on a global basis\". it \"Underlying the worldwide a, sales in 2010 of almost 75m cars it and commercial vehicles will it be the scrapping of some 55m h vehicles.

   "text_content" : "EUROPE is becoming the main battlegrounid in the world auto- motive industry In the 9loss with Japanese car makers set to increa rapidly their mar- Askest. with the build-up of nt by the uro- Aiigomisioand Japan at e-e O July on th issue of ums car Iales in Europe, appears effectively to have ho- sen to the end of the decade the level of direct exports of carsn and light commercial vehiclesfrom Ja to the EC. The agreemen reached only after years of negotiations among EC member states themselves as well as between Brussels and Tokyo, suggests a level of direct imports from Japan in 1999 of 1.2m vehicles (cars and light commercial vehicles up to five tonnes) compared with 1.24m in 1969. The way appears to have been left open, however, for Japanese car makers to build up nian:s: the volume of ice assembld at socalled transplants, Japanese plants in Europe, with no restrictions being placed either on Japa- nese investment or on the free circulation of European-built Japanese vehicles in the Com- munity. Japanese vehicle mak- ers also appear to be free to export cars from the US to Europe outside any ceiling. When the deal was announced Brussels made clear it had estimated output of Japanese cars in Europe could rise to 1.2m by 1999. Already the interpretations of the agreement have begun to differ greatly, however, with London insisting no limit has been set on the level of transplant pro- duction, while French car mak- ers appear to consider the 12m units as a ceiling. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecast recently that Jap- anese vehicle manufacturers could produce more than 1.8m vehicles a year in Europe by 1999, including cars and light commercial vehicles, compared with 257,000 in 1990. Under the deal between the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry, Japan will monitor exports to the EC in accordance with a forecast level of exports in 1999 of 1.23m, based on an assumed level of demand in the EC of 15.1m (cars and light commer- cial vehicles) in that year. Most analysts consider sales will easily exceed this level by 2000, however, as the EC fore- cast suggests only a minimal growth of 0.8 per cent a year from the 13.946m vehicles (cars and light commercial vehicles) achieved in 1969. Included in the overall export figure of 123m are sub- ceilings for exports to the five EC states - France (150,000), Italy (138,000), Spain (79,000), Portugal (23,000) and the UK (190,000) - which now impose national curbs on Japanese car The five EC states have promised to end their national restrictions by the end of 1992, by when the EC will also have introduced single-type approval for cars, therefore greatly simplifying the engi- neering of cars for sale in Europe by allowing common specification standards. From 1993 until the end of the century it will be up to the Japanese to control the flow of their direct car exports, follow- ing consultations every six months with the EC. The aim of the deal is that the EC car market should be fully liberal- ised from the end of the decade. Last year, Japanese car reg- istrations in western Europe increased by 5.6 per cent to 1.54m in a total market of 13.2m representing a market share of 11.7 per cent. In the EC the market share was 10 per cent compared with 30 per cent in the Efta countries. Even before the full Japa- nese assault on the European market, several of the tradi- tional European producers have found themselves on a bumpy road into the 1990s. For half a decade the Euro- pean car industry had enjoyed I five successive years of record car sales in western Europe up to the end of 1989. In the past two years sales patterns have begun to diverge sharply in dif- ferent European markets, how- ever, as demand in several key volume countries such as the UK, France and Spain has nose-dived, while sales in Ger- many have surged to a record. While many German car plants are working at full capacity the industry else- where has shed thousands of jobs. The profits of some car producers in Europe have plunged, while others have col- lapsed into loss, in the face of severe sales problems. The impact of falling demand on car makers has r been uneven. With several of Europe's car producers still over-dependent on domestic national markets, some have inevitably been hit hard, where these markets are in recession. In the first seven months of the year new car sales in west- ern Europe at 8.65m were 4 per cent higher than a year ago with the high level of demand in Germany masking the reces- sion in several other leading European markets. ExcludHia Germany, new car sales In western Europe in the firntst seven months were 10.4 per cent lower at 5.78m. Germany accounts for one In every three new cas sold in western Europe. In the first seven months this year sales in Germany reached an estimated 287m, a 583 per cent increase from the 1.87m in the same period a year ago, largely in western Germany. Western car makers began to have full access to the eastern German market from July last year in the wake of currency union. New car sales in the first six months fell by 2.8 per cent in the UK, 16.6 per cent in France, 16.4 per cent in Spain, 26.7 per cent in Sweden and 8.5 per cent in Finland, the markethit hardest by recession. Among the big six volume car makers .in Europe the stroneest performances are by the olkswagen ,ou hic includes Audi and SEAT, Gen- eral Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and Ford, which are the three leading players in Germany. The Volkswagen group increased its volume sales in the first seven months by an estimated 12.7 per cent allow- ing it to consolidate its posi- tion as the European market leader with a share of 16.7 per cent compared with 15.4 per cent a year ago. The challenge from the Fiat group of Italy (which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia), the main pre- tender in recent years to VW's European crown, has faded. Filat and the Peugeot group of France have lost gound this year, and Fiat in particular has come under heavy attack in its domestic market, mostly from Ford. Flat, Renault, Peugeot and Ford have all been forced to resort to idling assembly plants to reduce production during the last 12 months. On the financial front Ren- ault, the French state-owned car maker in which Volvo of Sweden has taken a 20 per cent stake as part of the two compa- nies' strategic alliance, sus- fered an 87 per cent drop in net income last year to only FFrl.2bn ($202m) from FFr9.3bn in 1989. In the first half of 1991 it suffered a 65.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to only FFr962m from FFr2.778bn in the correspond- ing period a year ago. The car operations of its Swedish partner, Volvo, also remained in loss in the first half of 1991. Among the big six volume car makers in Europe Ford also suffered a harsh financial set- back in 1990 with its second worst result in 10 years. The net profits of its European operations fell last year by 79.6 per cent to only $263m from $1.29bn in 1989 and a record $1.56bn in 1988. The net profit of Ford's European automotive operations alone fell by 87.9 per cent to only $145m from $1.19bn a year earlier. Kevin Done",

   "text_content" : "THE 1990s are supposed to be the decade of opportunity for the motor industry in Britain. More car assembly capacity is under construction than anywhere else in Europe, and by the mid-1990s output is forecast to be more than double the crisis level of the early 1980s. As the Japanese carmakers march in, compo- nent suppliers that have previously shunned manufacturing in the UK are following in their wake. In the short term, however, the indus- try could be forgiven for thinking that it was slipping back into the dark days of the late 1970s and early 1960s. The decade has begun with the steepest slide into recession since the war. After five successive record years from 1985 to 1989, UK new car sales have fallen ominously. Registrations last year were down by 12.7 per cent - admittedly from a record level - and sales have plunged by a further 25 per cent in the first seven months this year, a period in which registrations were 33 per cent lower than two years ago. UK producers have forecast a fall in new car sales to around 1.55m this year from 2m in 1990 and a record 2.3m in 1989. The UK motor trade and industry is facing a further 40,000 job losses by next summer, bringing the total to 68,500 since mid-1990, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK motor industry trade association. At the same time, the Retail Motor Industry Federation believes that 800 franchised dealers will have been forced out of business by mid-1992 as a result of the decline in the car market. Among UK car makers Jaguar, the luxury car producer taken over by Ford of the US for Â£1.6bn at the end of 1989, has been one of the hardest hit, as it has suffered the impact of the reces- sions in both the UK and in the US, its two most important markets worldwide. It is being forced to make severe cuts in its workforce and job losses in the second half of this year mean that Jag- uar will have cut its workforce by 30 per cent in 12 months to less than 8,500. Jaguar output is expected to fall by 40 per cent to less than 25,000 this year, the lowest level since 1982 and less than half the peak level of 51,939 reached in 1988. Sales worldwide plunged by 42.4 per cent in the first seven months to 14,808. A Â£66m loss at Jaguar, coupled with the financing costs for the very expen- sive takeover, helped to push Ford of Britain, now the -Jaguar parent com- pany, into a Â£274m pre-tax loss last year, compared with a pre-tax profit of Â£483m in 1989, the first loss suffered by Ford in Britain since 1971. e Ford is cutting its UK wor kforce and r other carmakers, including Rover, Peugeot-Talbot and Rolls-Royce. Motor Cars, are also shedding labour in the a face of the severe downturn in demand. s Surprisingly, car output in the first e seven months of 1991 at 796,434 was e actually 7 per cent higher than in the i corresponding period last year, y although it was still 2 per cent below e the level of two years ago. UK car pro- duction has been supported by the unexpectedly strong growth of sales in t export markets, although the SMMT s has warned recently that the rate of e growth in exports will slow signifi- t cantly in the final months of the year. Ford, Rover, General Motors (Vaux- s hall) and Nissan have all sharply s increased exports this year, partly in s response to the big jump in new car demand in Germany. Production of cars I for export in the first seven months r rose by 109.5 per cent to 373,442 from 178,255 a year ago, while output for the a domestic market fell by 25.3 per cent to 422,992. v Production at Nissan's plant at i Sunderland in north-east England, the first Japanese car assembly operation in Europe, which began at low volume V in 1966, is now rising quickly and is ) expected to reach 120,000 compared e with 76,000 in 1990. i A further boost will be received next a year when Nissan begins output of a second car range at the plant and the i full capacity of 220,000 cars a year could I be reached in 1993. r The export programmes at Vauxhall (the UK subsidiary of General Motors) and Ford, which stem from changes in a sourcing policy by GM and Ford's Euro- I pean operations, have helped to cushion assembly plants at Luton and Ellesmere t Port (Vauxhall) and Dagenham (Ford) from the impact of the recession. s One benefit from the recession has been the unexpectedly rapid improve- ment in the UK motor industry trade e balance, which has languished in deficit for most of the 1980s. In the first six months the deficit was reduced by 79 1. per cent to only Â£617m from Â£2.997bn a D year ago. The value of UK motor indus- try exports rose by 18 per cent to i Â£5.474bn, while the value of imports fell i by 20 per cent to Â£6.091bn. 4 The improvement has been driven by D the recession, which has sharply depressed imports of new cars and com- i mercial vehicles, and by the marked improvement in exports. f In spite of the retrenchment brought on by recession, the accent through the t 1990s in the UK car and components if sectors is still expected to be firmly on V expansion with optimistic forecasts sug- *gesting a leap in UK car assembly UK CAR MARKET 50 Imports (% share) 40 * 30 on T Others 9.7% Fiat (incl.

The sector's prospects are being transformed by the wave of inward investment by Japanese car makers into the UK. It appears certain that by the second half of the 1990s Japanese carmakers will account directly for around a third of UK production of some 2m units a year, helped by total planned investments of more than Â£1.8bn that have already been announced. ENissan will build more than 200,000 cars a year at its Â£700m Sunderland plant by 1992-93. Nissan is also invest- ing in UK R&D facilities. * Toyota is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by late 1995, rising to 200,000 cars a year by 1997-98 at Burnas- ton, near Derby. It is investing Â£840m in car assembly and engine plants. * Honda is committed to building 100,000 cars a year by 1994 at its Â£350m Swindon assembly and engine plant. At the same time Rover is producing up to 40,000 Honda Concertos a year at its Longbridge Birmingham plant. Honda holds a 20 per cent equity stake in Rover's vehicle operations.",

   "text_content" : "THE ADDITION of the car-hungry east German mar- ket has given west Germany's motor industry a powerful and timely impetus at a time when sales in other countries are mostly slowing down. Not only has German unifi- cation led to higher sales of western cars in the east, but it has also boosted western Ger- many's second-hand car mar- ket and thus helped new car sales. With used vehicle prices showing increases of up to 30 per cent as a result of demand from the east, the temptation for west Germans to sell their old models and buy new ones has been immense. Without the powerful impulse from Germany's five new eastern states, in two of which modern car plants are being built by Volkswagen and Opel, the car industry would be much less buoyant Since a high proportion of the western German car indus- try's sales go to foreign mar- kets, the steep deterioration in export business is a cause for concern. In the first seven months of 1991, car exports slumped by 23 per cent to 1.24m units. Total output, how- ever, was up by 4 per cent to nearly 2.9m cars as the domes- tic market kept on growing. Sales also spurted in this period. Some of the domestic sales improvement in July was caused by a concentration of buying just before the ending of tax concessions on pur- chases of cars using lead-free petrol. New car registrations in western Germany shot up by 33 per cent in January-July to 2.45m cars; in July, the rise was 64 per cent over the same month last year and 26 per cent up on June 1991. The fervent hope among car industry executives is that by the time domestic growth tails off, as it inevitably must, for- eign markets will have picked up. In Europe, says James Capel, the UK stockbrokers, \"the phenomenal strength of the German market is at the moment almost exactly com- pensating for the weakness of other markets, and all produc- ers are attempting to increase their sales into Germany to take advantage of the boom\". For the full year, James Capel expects car sales to show an increase of 20 per cent to 3.93m units, equivalent to 30 per cent of the total western European market, against 24.5 per cent in 1990. But the pace will slow in the second half as a result of consumer tax rises (including petrol) to help pay for unity, rising unemployment in eastern Germany, and the fact that demand was already high in the second half of last year. It expects a rise of 10 per cent in the third quarter and a 5 per cent decline in the fourth quarter. Next year, Capel reckons the German market will drop by about 7 per cent. For the car companies, the domestic sales bonanza could not have come at a better time. It has enabled them to offset the effect of slowing sales elsewhere, partic- ularly in the UK and Spain and in the US. But the volume pro- ducers like VW and Opel (part of General Motors of the US) have been unable to produce enough cars to meet total Ger- man demand. Thus importers have also benefited from rising sales in Unification has increased sales of cars In the east the enlarged market. Last year, says the German motor indus- try association (VDA), imports accounted for nearly a third of the domestic market, with new registrations of French cars showing a rise of 20 per cent and the Japanese adding 11 per cent. If the cars made by Ger- man producers abroad - as in Spain or Belgium - are included, the import share rises to 38 per cent. Because west Germany has traditionally been an open market, the import share has tended to be higher than in neighbouring European mar- kets, with the Japanese estab- lishing a strong foothold. But pressures from outside are now increasing and the German producers are well aware that they will be forced to compete even more effectively for the rest of the 1990s, especially against Japan. After 1992, the EC will be opened up more widely to out- side competition, though not all at once. The Japanese will obviously make increasing use of this opportunity, having already begun to sell their new luxury models on the Euro- pean market in addition to their constantly evolving fam- ily and sports car ranges. With German labour costs higher than in Japan and most Euro- pean countries, and working hours shorter, the going will become rougher, warns the VDA. Thus the German advan- tages of high quality, reliabil- ity and performance will become eroded. Car and parts producers have complained bit- terly about the pay rises of around 7 per cent agreed in the engineering industry this year. Companies are buying an increasing volume of compo- nents in lower-cost countries abroad, or shifting output of some products - as in the case of Robert Bosch, the compo- nents maker - overseas where output is cheaper. Germany's two big luxury car makers. Mercedes-Benz and BMW, are well aware that the Japanese have not been idle in their market sectors and that they will have to strain to the utmost to keep profits at levels high enough to finance the high development costs of new cars. Mercedes recently brought out its costly S-class executive model at the top of the range, and is charging a higher price for the car. But all the range will come under increasing pressure. BMW has just produced the latest generation of its success- ful 3-series at the lower end of its range. Demand has been high and the waiting lists are long. But the company is con- cerned that if Japanese rivals pitch the prices of their new models too low, this will cut into BMW's profit margins; these depend on the company's ability to offer a variety of style and equipment options within its basic model range, for which it is able to charge premium prices. With nearly 800,000 employ- ees, the German motor indus- try plays a vital role in the German economy. As the VDA emphasises, the key to main- taining competitiveness lies in the cost structure. So far, the German companies have coped with their high costs, not least by producing some highly desirable cars and keeping their performance and environ- mental standards high. The pressure is on them to con- tinue doing just that. Andrew Fisher",

In the agreement -a-nmered out with tWeEuropean Corn mission in July, state-con trolled Renault and PSA, pri vately-owned maker of Peugeol and Citroin trands, may have bought themselves some breathing space before the Jap anese manufacturers are allowed virtually unlimited competition at the end of 1999 But their task of restructuring and shaping up for the free market is likely to be difficull and may get harder before ii gets any easier. Some analysts fear they will never make the grade. One Paris broker, looking towards the end of the century, forecasts that the European cat market will grow at an average of 1.5 per cent for the rest ol the decade. If the Japanese are allowed to take a 16-17 per cent share ol the total market, a figure already exceeded in some terri- tories, less than half of the growth will go to European manufacturers.

Small wonder, then, that the two French manufacturers lob- blied hard to keep the restric. tionsirojhe Japanese in place for as.long as possible. Small wonder, too, that Mrs Edith Cresson, the new prime minis- ter, whose mission seems to be both controversialand patii- otic, supported themh In her bull-headed way with vitriolic attacks on the Japanese. Nor was it surprising that; having secured what was prob- ably the best proposal the French industry could have reasonably hoped for, Mrs Cresson was pragmatically willing to clutch the Japanese nettle and suggest that France would indeed be a good site for a future satellite factory.

Mr Raymond LAvy, the Ren- ault chairman, probably has more to worry about than Mr Jacques Calvet, his opposite number at PSA, which is gen- erally regarded as having the stronger product range. Its small hatchback Peugeot 205, despite its age, remains the best selling car in the coun- try, accounting for 9.3 per cent of all sales. The introduction of the new Citroen ZX earlier this year has helped restore the marque's quality image. The Renault stable, on the other hand, is beginning to Iook a little tired. The Clio, its replacement for the R5, intro- duced in France at the end of last year, has met with only modest success. In direct compehtii6n with the 205, it scored only a provi- sional 7.7 per cent market share in July. - For the future, analysts fore see little change In policies. The drive for productivity is likely to be the main theme for the rest of the decade. At PSA, it is taking a radical form. In April the Poissy plant, near Paris, producing the Peugeot 309 and the Citrodn ZX, began working four-day rotas in shifts of 10 hours each, much to the horror of the gov- ernment which is trying to reduce working hours in France.

PSA last month acted to sas to *;ok the emUS having sold only 2,200 cars there since the beginning of the year. Renault has approached the problem differently. It says its alliance with Volvo, made pos- sible by Renault's change of status from a state guaranteed regie into a lited\"l y company, will lead to an * \"interchange of functlqnft^and components betwee tI to firms and enable the Ig ing gains in produtiti profitability needed for amnoe secure future\".

Body variants fell from 2-, to 27 and the total'hiiiltbe of body components dropped from 179 to 119. low Mr ILvy hopes to cut development time. Yet not only has Renault's profitability been wobbly in the past few years, but it must also begin to pay back the FFr6.7bn of state aid that the EC has declared illegal. Its problems are the more press- ing, but both manufacturers have essentially the same eight-year task ahead ofthem; grinding away at productiity until it is on a par with the Japanese.

   "text_content" : "THOUGH nobody is talking about crisis at Fiat, the Turin car maker faces testing chal- lenges. Progress in the Italian market by foreign makers has eroded what until recently seemed a secure, home base. From 52.8 per cent last year, Fiat's share of car sales in Italy has dropped steeply. Italian sales by the group, whose badges include Lancia, Autobianchi, Innocenti, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, have now been overtaken by imports. The sorpasso that occurred during 1990 has been con- firmed in the first half of the year, with imports moving fur- ther ahead. Figures from the importers' association Unione Nazionale Rappresentanti Autoveicoli Esteri (Unrae) show that Fiat Group's share is now 47.6 per cent. . Visitors to Italy in the 1960s may remember the almost complete dominance of Italian- made cars on the roads. About six cars from every seven that left the showrooms had been made in Italy. Even during the 1970s two out of three new reg- istrations had come off Italian assembly lines. The position of Italian mak- ers worsened during the 1980s, when their average share fell to about 58 per cent. By the end of the decade made-in-Italy meant built-by-Fiat, and the group maintained its share. Fiat Group followed its 59.9 per kg cent of home market in 1988 by in taking 57.7 per cent in the fol- I- lowing year. an Clearly the 1990s have as started badly for Fiat, and Ly many ask when the decline e. will stop. It is unlikely that r, marketing staff at Fiat head- ly quarters would have forecast today's position two or three p, years ago. a, It would have taken courage fa to predict the drop of more I than 10 per cent. Are Fiat's s. forecasters now telling top ud management that its share will n- fall by a similar amount over ie the next two years, as pre- ir- dicted by Unrae? ie Officials at the importers' ie association say that in an ti industry that has been under- e) going a process of globalisa- is tion, and given Italy's EC membership, it was impossible 3s for Italian cars to keep their it share of the national market. n- Other factors have also con- it tributed to Fiat's weakening at position. Industry analysts i point to a combination of qual- ie ity problems, an ageing model g- range and aggressive competi- a tion by importers. Fiat has been unable to lose k- a reputation for quality short- s, comings.

This creates problems if it wants to com- pensate falling home sales by higher exports,\" he says. Fiat's model range also helps explain the inroads that for- eign cars are making in Italy. The Tipo, launched three years ago, has not been the winner that was hoped in the highly competitive segment C. Fig- ures for the first half of this year show that the drop in sales of the Tipo has been con- siderably sharper than for the segment as a whole. Fortunately for Fiat, the evergreen Uno continues to be a success. It remains a con- stant favourite in spite of its January 1983 launch, and still leads the listings. With more than 200,000 delivered to Ital- ian buyers between January and June, the Uno sold nearly twice as many as its nearest Segment B rival, Ford's Fiesta. Though the Uno's achieve-, ment is considerable, ground is being lost to newer models. Italians are not only being lured into Ford's showrooms by the Escort in Segment C and the Fiesta. Their attention is being attracted and cheque books opened by Volkswagen's rejuvenated Polo and Passat, Renault's Clio and Opel's Vec- tra. However, competition is no longer limited to the familiar names of Europe's automobile industry. This year is likely to be remembered for the foothold secured in the Italian market by cars with Japanese names. That the frntier has now been breached is recorded in Unrae's statistics. During the first half of the year Nbisan sold nearly 9,000 cars in Italy, followed by Suzuki with 7,000 and Honda and Mitsubishi each with 4800. Sales at the end of June amounted to almost 35,000, pointing to a full year that exceeds the all-time total Imported up to three years ago. Moreover, there has been a radical chnIgr in the type of vehicle brought into Italy. Ordinary aloons now comfort- ably outnumber four-wheel drive off-road vehices. trian are starting to get a tarte for the models \"ade by 1p secar makers.

Fiat agrees with the line adopted by the hardest Euro- pean opponents regarding Jap- anese makers, seeking a grad- ual lowering of barriers linked to \"concrete and credible reci- procity\". However, it is difficult for the Turin group to maintain a tough stance on transplants. Its biggest hope for the imme- diate future lies with the new Cinquecento Segment A model that is being produced by the FSM plant at Bielsko Blala in Poland and will be launched at the beginning of next year. Flat must hope that its Polish transplants will enjoy the same quality ratings and customer approval earned by Japan's European transplants. The Polish venture, continu- ing a longstanding relationship that has *nvoed the produc- tion of the 126 and 125 models, is prt of a strategic position- ing that seemed to give Flat a valuable competitive edge as eastern Europe opened up. But expectations have been scaled down in recognition of the severe problems faced in the newly-democratising region.

   "text_content" : "Bottleneck: most of tlh congestion Is caused by delivery and service vehicles ONE OF the least desirable effects of the motor vehicle, urban congestion, is something with which we are all familiar and for which most of us have an answer. The problem is that most answers are different. One faction lobbies for better roads, another for cars to be banned from city centres. Somewhere in the middle come those who plead that better public transport would wean car drivers from their lonely and frustrating journeys. The crucial question in this area, seldom asked and never properly answered, is what gravitational force creates a big urban centre. We are, after all, in an age of electronic com- munication; with a handful of specialised exceptions, our big shopping areas have moved out of large city centres; our living areas moved out of them long ago. Yet some force causes offices and their attendant service industries to agglomerate in London or New York or Tokyo. This suggests that far from the problems of a congested envi- ronment forcing companies and people to move out, there is a critical size beyond which ever more companies are attracted to move in. Nobody seems to know why, yet the answer is crucial to the way traffic congestion is Soe of the truisms of the situation escape the most extreme lobbies on either side of the argument. Full and free movement, the provision of a rid of multiplune feway split-level Intersections and huge car parks on the Los Angeles pattern produce Los Angeles results: a sprawl of magaof severe ponDtion, excessive energy use - and severe traffic congestion. igey y, those who argue far -cvar n to be lennrd fom ety centres agI, or dheesto -m#L, tlnt~metmo .- t is caused by delivery, ser- vice and publ transport vehicles one kind or he anti-car\" lobby alsbo seems n to impDy that i eo Pih who drve to work tir own cars do ao t doatd or sheer od aIy s t enthusias f pablI trans- port ignas the t that the publi transport syst-ems of mo bit g cies a already oerlWine and coPM car- ril adt tbhe haB wigat ol~e ttmist s.nm Is theta lth ggeeleton ii.L e environmentally disruptive. , A study of urban transport g history seems to show that the r real purpose of any new public re transport scheme is to speed it travel along a particular corr- t. dor in which congestion is .r threatening to reach crisis : level; and the process contin- i. ues to this day, as witness the ie plans to extend London's Ã½r underground railway system. n The clear implication is that .y public and private transport must work in unison, not in is opposition. Ir At the more detailed level, it there is now great interest in a Europe in the potential of elec- r tronic controls and computers *- to ease traffic flows. There is a f logic to this, since Europe has g by far the largest number of d ancient cities - most of them r suffering severe congestion of n horse-drawn traffic 100 years ago - which cannot seriously s contemplate tearing up large e tracts of their centres to install n split-level intersections. .

It also means that road space can be shared as efficiently as possible. It is quite possible to conceive, along this branch of Prome- thean technology, the comput- er-controlled avoidance of vehicle conflict, with opposing traffic streams traversing a crossroads in the manner of the motorcycle display team at the Royal Tournament. Communication between vehicles offers the possibility, as Volkswagen for instance has already demonstrated in the safety of its own test track, that cars can be operated in close convoy, automatically controlled to run less than a metre apart. Apart from mak- ing optimum use of road space, the technique also improves fuel economy by ensuring steady-speed operation and reducing the aerodynamic drag of each vehicle. Communication between vehicle and driver is proving to be perhaps the most obdurate of the problems addressed by Prometheus. This is partly because this is the one area where there is a large body of existing technology, but also because systems have to be devised which allow the driver to interface without taking his attention off the road ahead (unless his vehicle is under full automatic control). Thus systems based on multifunc- tion display screens need very careful devising, while the assumption that a driver will hear and react to audio signals - via a synthesised voice, for s rmmlm - has been called into q tion by research fndings. Abve all, two ears must be allayed before such research can be eaploited on a large scale.

   "text_content" : "Toyota Cwlia: UK production boeglin l 12 III TOYOTA, Japan's largest car maker, sold 351,000 cars in western Europe in 1990 and appears on course for a mar-' ginal increase this year. Unlike Nissan and Honda, its car sales in the region are made up entirely of imports from Japan. All that will change from December next year, when the assembly lines start to roll at its Â£700m ($1,176m) car plant now moving rapidly towards completion at a 280-acre site at Burnaston, Derbyshire. The plant, which is comple- mented by a Â£140m engine- manufacturing facility at Shot- ton, north Wales, is due by 1995 to be producing 100,000 units a year of a 1.8 litre suc- cessor to Toyota's Carina fam- ily saloon. This output is officially Toyota scheduled to rise to 200,000 units, possibly through the adoption of a second model, by well before the end of the decade. By then, the two plants should be employing a total of 3,300 people. In the past few weeks, as the EC and Japan have arrived successfully at an \"understand- ing\" on the liberalisation of Japanese car sales in the EC post-1992, the suspicions of some industry observers that these output figures understate Toyota's real intentions appear to have been borne out. The UK government's own Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is now known to have internal estimates fore- casting that Toyota will be producing 300,000 cars a year in the UK by the end of the decade. So far at least, Toyota pro- fesses to have no explanation of how the DTI has arrived at this figure. However, the same govern- ment estimates - used in establishing the government's stance in the EC-Japan talks - also show Nissan producing 400,000 cars a year in the UK by the end of the decade, com- pared with 200,000 acknowl- edged formally by Nissan itself, and 200,000 by Honda, which so far has declafed a commitment to only 100,000 units a year. Such projections imply good news for Europe's components manufacturers, given the com- mitments of all three manufac- turers to \"local\" - meaning EC - content of at least 80 per cent in full production. This is particularly the case since Toyota is expected to join Nissan in exporting both UK- built cars and engines, not just to Continental markets but to Japan as well. Mr Junji Numata, chairman of Toyota Motor Manufactur- ing of the UK (TMMUK), says that some 40,000 engines a year will be supplied to other Toyota plants overseas, includ- ing North America. Toyota itself recently com- pleted the process of choosing its 150 or so prototype compo- nent suppliers, only a handful of which are either Japanese- owned or European joint ven- tures with Japanese compa- nies. Successful European compa- nies include the UK's GKN group, Pilkington's Triplex subsidiary, BTR and Pirelli. Even so, it is inevitable that the total of Â£1.8bn being invested by Japanese car mak- ers in the UK is drawing in an increasing number of Japanese component companies, such as Nippondenso and Calsonic, who will undoubtedly use con- tracts with the car companies as a springboard for seeking business with indigenous Euro- i pean car companies. Privately, TMMUK, the UK manufacturing company, has set itself the goal of achieving more than 90 per cent local content - a level which would require gearboxes, also, to be manufactured within the Europe. T This is now understood to be part of Toyota's planning for the UK, although so far it is neither denying nor confirm- ing that such a plant will go ahead. The UK is not Toyota's only manufacturing venture in Europe, although so far it is the only one involving cars. Since 1989 around 10,000 Toyota light pick-ups have been produced at Volkswagen's Hanover plant in Germany, with two-thirds of output being sold as VWs and one-third under the Toyota badge. Recently, the collaboration with Volkswagen has been strengthened with an agree- ment under which Volkswagen cars are to be sold through Toyota dealerships, which are to set up separate sales and service outlets for the German cars. Toyota's overall aim is to at least double its share of the western European car market, to around 5 per cent, by the late 1990s. To achieve this, Toyota is taking firm action to increase the size of its sales networks in western Europe, by nearly one half to 2,500, in particular in its \"home\" European base, the UK. To this end, it is taking a progressively larger stake in Toyota (GB), the Inchcape Group-owned importer which has sold Toyotas in the UK for many years. Under the agreement, Toyota will have 51 per cent control by 1998. To underline the partner- ship aspects of the deal, how- ever, Toyota has taken a 4.7 per cent stake in Inchcape itself. Like all Japanese manufac- turers, Toyota knows perfectly well that the days of selling in one market cars originally designed for another are well and truly over. It is for that reason that it i has established an engineering and marketing centre near Brussels, at a cost of more than Â£100m, to develop cars in tune with the tastes and other requirements of European buy- ers.

Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of France's Peugeot group, has described. the UK as a \"Japanese aircraft carrier off the coast of Europe\". About 80 per cent of Sunder- land's output is being exported, double the 3040 per cent origi- nally envisaged by Nissan and contributing about Â£500m to the UK's balance of trade. Nor are all the cars destined for Europe: earlier in the sum- mer the plant began shipping 2,000 units a year to Taiwan and the first of 8,000 Primeras a year to Japan itself. The question most occupy- ing the attention of analysts now is for how long Nissan will be content to stay at even the 220,000 capacity level. Nissan has previously indi- cated informally it would like to move towards an output of 400,000 cars a year in the UK, and the UK government now believes this is likely before the end of the 1990s. Such output would leave Nissan challenging Ford and Vauxhall as the UK's second- largest producer behind Rover Group. Nissan's manufacturing attentions are by no means fbcused solely on the UK. It has substantial capacity, through its Spanish operation, Nissan Motor Iberica, produc- ing Patrol off-road vehicles, as well as vans and a new \"multi- passenger vehicle\"(MPV), the Serena. Nissan has also linked up with Ford to produce a four- wheel-drive leisure vehicle to compete with vehicles pio- neered by Land Rover and Jap- anese rivals, such as the Mitsu- bishi Shogun/Pajero, Isuzu Trooper and Suzuki Vitara. It is is being developed mainly by Nissan and will be built at Nis- san's Motor Iberica plant. To bolster its manufacturing efforts, the company has estab- lished two centres in the UK for its European vehicle design and development operations as part of a Â£31m investment pro- gramme. Nissan European Technology Centre, the company which will form the European link in the company's planned global research and development net- work, has been set up at Cran- rnmra: snaing uR-ouun car to jupun field Institute of Technology's technology park in Bedford- shire, with a secondary opera- tion at Sunderland itself. The two centres are to design and develop future cars to be built in the UK and Spain and specifically tailored for the European market. According to Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, Nis- san's UK car assembly opera- tion, Nissan needs to be able to design a vehicle from scratch in Europe. Within this decade, it is intended to launch European model ranges the body, suspen- sion, drive axles and trim of which have been designed, developed and engineered in Europe, chiefly in the UK. Nissan is to undertake con- siderable strengthening of its distribution activities in Europe to prepare for increased sales. But at least one of its biggest headaches, a long-running dis- pute with its distributor of more than 20 years in the UK, appears finally to be over. It is setting up a new com- pany, Nissan Motor (GB), to distribute all Nissan products in the UK next year, following an Appeal Court decision not to intervene in its decision to cut all ties with Mr Octav Bot- nar's Nissan UK from Decem- ber 31 this year. The UK has been by far the most important market for Nis- san within Europe, until recently accounting for about half of all Nissan sales in Europe and nearly 6 per cent of the total UK market. The dispute with Nissan UK, however, over a number of issues including pricing, this year has sent Nissan's sales plunging to less than half this level and the new network will have a huge task next year to launch a recovery. In the long term, Nissan hopes to secure 10 per cent of the UK market. John Griffiths",

   "text_content" : "HONDA, Japan's third largest carmaker, 1 now moving on a broad frout to expand its presence In Europe, encouraged that the long- sought framework for Japanese car sale in the EC post-1992 is now in place. Within days of the EC4apane r nt being reached last Hondi announced that' it oul exa-nd' its European dealer neti' rk to aiiaroud 2,000 by the mid-1990s, from surentÂ· Just Â·under lifO *,; . with a planned increase in west pean sales from 100,000 last year - representing just 1. per cent of the west European market - to 250,000 over the same period, as Honda starts to feel the benefit of its car manufac- turing operations at Swindon in the UK and the post-1992 easing of sales restrictions in other large EC markets such as France and Italy. The Swindon plant is due to start production of a medium-size family car, code-named Syncro, late next year, with output scheduled to rise to more than 100,000 cars annually by 1995, when 2,000 should be employed there. About half will be sold as Hon- das, the other half under the badge of Rover, with which Honda has 20 per cent cross-shareholdings. Though never confirmed by Rover, the Swindon car is widely expected to provide an upmarket replacement for Rover's ageing Montego range, pro- duced at Cowley to the east of Swin- don, in a plant scheduled for closure \"in the early 1990s\". Honda's Swindon plant is rapidly taking final shape on a 360-acre site in the Wiltshire countryside. It already employs nearly 700 people and has had engine production on stream for two years, providing units for the Honda Concerto/Rover 200/400 models that Rover produces for both partners at Longbridge, near Birmingham. It made '5,u000 engnes last year and tb is capacity for 200,000. This year Rover will provide Honda with 40.000 Cocertos, upfrom :5026 in 190, andiexected to renwln at t*i<evel nutfi le6s. wlhen the models' Cmqs*& should be due. to which Honda and 1-01 0laborate future mod- es ha been the subject of consider- able ulatio, largely because of what happened the launch of thdr first jointly produced cars, the executive class Rover 800/Hondu Leg- end. The agreement provided for Handa to build Rover's version su well as its own in Japan, and for Rover to do the same in the UK. Both activities quickly came to an end, requiring the companies to rebut industry rumours that Honda was dissatisfled with its Honda ACCord Arodecr: xpoxrwo Drom us 0 wurop ud partner's build quality. Such rumour were further fuelled by the poor repu- da tatlon the big Rover quickly acquired an in North America and the fact that at since then executive car replacent =* have been developed separately. 'Hoidwever such problems, if they ad existeda psmear to hav been laid to . rest by tii successful Rover 200/ Of Honda hb Honda Concerto programme and the da taking of cross-shareholdinp with its Rover, which is 80 percent owned by he British Aerospace. Sir Graham Day, as Rover's chairman, says that further he clear evidence that the collaboration n is alive and well is to emerge later in its the decade, when other nrew model programmes coincide. Despte the 56 per cent sales growth Honda envisages in western Europe over the next four years, Honda insists that none of it will be accounted for by increased exports from Japan. Instead, some of the increase wil come from higher imports from Honda plants in North America, from which Accord estate cars are already ieing shipped at a rate of 5,000 a year. that is expected to rise to 10,000 a year by 1965. The bulk of the increase, however, will come from Swindon. Exports from Japan will remain at around last year's 150,000 level, despite last month's EC-Japan \"understanding\", say executives of Honda Motor Europe, the UK-based company set up late last year to oversee both Honda's developing pan-European strategy and its existing activities. The latter extend to 17 sales and manufacturing subsidiaries or affil- ates, including motorcycles and power products and - of considerable sig- nificance - a research and develop- ment centre at Offenbach, Germany. Within the next two to three months a new building complex is scheduled for completion at Offen- bach which will allow Honda R & D Europe more adequately to fulfil its triple role of providing Japan with intelligence on market and technical trends in Europe, supporting manu- facturing subsidiaries in their product planning, designing and development of locally produced components, and helping Japanese R & D centres adapt products to European tastes. Meanwhile, Honda has chosen the 130 component suppliers for the Syn- cro. Between them they will share annual business estimated by Honda of the UK Manufacturing (HUM) to be worth Â£600-800m in full production. UK suppliers are expected to account for about 50 per cent of the total. The list includes most of the UK's biggest component groups, together with the German group Robert Bosch, whose Â£100m alternator plant at Mis- kin, near Cardiff, is now on stream. Honda has already expressed the hope that it will be able to increase its European car sales to 300,000 cars a year in the second half of the 1990s. That would mean either a really big increase in imports from North Amer- ica - or further manufacturing expansion at Swindon. While Honda has declared no inten- tion to increase output beyond the 100,000 a year mark, it is significant that private estimates within the UK Department of Trade and Industry put Honda's UK output at 200,000 cars a year by 1999.

   "text_content" : "THE desire of eastern and central European nations for speedy re-integration into the world economy opens up a potential market of 420m peo- ple and opportunities for low- cost production which will dra- matically condition the future of the world car industry. The balance of power in the European car market has already been tilted in Volkswa- gen's favour by the emergence of a strong new market in for- mer East Germany and the strong demand for second-hand cars from poorer buyers else- where in eastern and central Europe. Thanks to the German re-unification bonus, Volkswa- gen has taken a big lead over Fiat in the European leader- ship stakes which it clearly intends to consolidate through its strategic investments in Skoda and Baz of Czechoslo- vakia. Skoda is by far the best existing producer in the region and has moved smartly to fill a gap at the lower end of the market once reserved for obso- lete cars such as the Trabant. The new Skoda Favorit has become the best-selling model in Yugoslavia and has also done well in former East Ger- many. But VW's commitment to inject capital, know-how and its marketing network in return for eventual 70 per cent control ensures that Skoda is well placed to repeat VW's suc- cess story with Seat in Spain. By smart footwork VW also managed to deflect General Motors which was also inter- ested in the small Slovak pro- ducer BAZ. VW managed to secure an 80 per cent stake and will assemble Passat models as well as gear boxes at its Brati- slava plant. For Fiat, the growth of com- petition in its once protected domestic market, raises the strategic importance of Poland and the Soviet Union in its overall production and market- ing plans. Fiat saw the long-term potential of eastern Europe and the Soviet market three decades ago. It concen- trated on licensing and produc- tion agreements in the two most populous countries of the region, Poland with 36m and the Soviet Union with 280m people. It gained immense experience in negotiating with the former communist hierar- chies and in solving the logisti- cal, organisational and other specific difficulties of building and assisting production in huge green field plants initially id employing thousands of work- r ers without prior experience in ie the automotive industry. In a this it was able to draw on its o- own experience of the industr- w- ialisation of post-war Italy and a- in Third World markets. re Thanks to Fiat the Soviet Union became the world's larg- e est producer of late 1960s is model Fiats, adapted to the a- Soviet climate and primitive e road and service infrastruc- ir- ture. They are still being ie turned out in their hundreds of id thousands from Togliatti, e-- named in honour of the former al Italian Communist Party in leader.

Output could rise to i 220,000 a year eventually. is It is a different story at the I- obsolete FSO plant in Warsaw where Fiat would like to build - Tipo-style family saloons, 1 engines and gearboxes. But Le Fiat's proposals to merge FSO id and FSM into a new holding as structure with a special \"stra- t- tegic investor\" role for Fiat fell Le foul of political opposition to * granting it near monopoly sta- !t tus. Fiat also had to contend i- with a strong lobby which c- favours more American invest- 'o ment, for political as well as :i economic reasons. i It is against this background i that General Motors made its ie own feasibility study for a *h $100m assembly operation to r- produce 30,000 to 50,000 saloon *i- Cars at FSM. A decision is -r expected before the end of the g year. n GM's approach to Poland is ly part of its wider European k- strategy which has already in been amended to take in the In potential of the new pan-Euro- ,ts pean market. It has already tr- invested DM1bn in a new plant id at Eisenach in former East Germany to build 150,000 new et Astra model cars from a green g- field factory incorporating all Ds the latest in production tech- ie nology gleaned from its joint re ventures with Toyota and .c- Suzuki in the US. The Astra ig will also be assembled in small of volumes at Szentgotthard in ti, Hungary where GM is also er investing heavily in a new ty engine plant capable of turning in out 200,000 engines a year. ie GM has taken the lead ve among US producers in eastern Ã½r- and central Europe although -t- Ford recently signed a Â£24m agreement to supply 20,000 die- - sel engines for the Moskvitch replacement, the Aleko, which r is based on the Renault 20. But the Ford deal remains small beer alongside GM's $lbn five- year contract to supply cata- lytic converters and engine parts to the VAZ plant at Gorki. They will be fitted in Soviet-built cars destined for pollution-conscious western markets. In general, however, western * companies remain cautious is about big investments in the M Soviet Union. Mercedes Benz in has signed a DM250m deal for is production of its buses under d- licence in the Soviet Union but 26 plans for production of Mer- .e cedes saloons appear to be e- marking time. 30 Delay is also dogging Fiat's *n ambitious plans to help build a ;t- green field plant at Yelabuga to to produce 300,000 Uno-type small cars and 300,000 Panda ie utility cars as well as large- w scale engine-building facilities.

   "text_content" : "WHEN THE German border was opened nearly two years ago and west and Mat could see how the other side lived, one of the most obvious difrences was in the types of car people drove. In Germany, the landof Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche, the car is one of the most desired of con- sumer objects. West German roads and autobahns have become more and more congested over the years as the number of car owners has grown in line with the expansion of the economy. For east Germans, who also love cars but were long deprived of the variety available in the west, it was a galling sight when their own humble Trabants and Wartburgs were compared with the newer, faster and environmentally cleaner models driven by west Ger- mans. Many east Germans have dis- carded their old cars, for which they had had to wait patiently for many years, and used their savings or bor- rowed money to buy Opels, VWs or other European and Japanese vehicles. Not surprisingly, therefore, the vehicle industry has been one of the forerunners in west German investment in the new eastern states. VW is build- ing a new plant in Saxony, close to the site of the old Trabant factory, while Opel (part of General Motors of the US) is putting up an assembly plant in Eisenach, close to where the Wartburgs used to be built, only a few kilometres from the old border. Through aggressive marketing and its attractive model range, Opel has pushed ahead of VW (excluding its upmarket Audi subsidiary) in the east German market. In view of VW's high status and recognition factor through- out Germany, this is surprising; in the d east, Opel had a 21 per cent market it share in the first half of 1991 against 15 a 'cent for VW. Obviously, Mr Louis n ughs, the ebullient chief executive of Opel, is delighted. *We thought we i, could be close to them, maybe even a a little bit ahead, but to have that differ- i- ence was something we didn't expect.\" d Not that VW has been slow to appre- e date the possibilities in east Germany. r It moved quickly to strengthen its links h with IFA, the former east German car concern. It began with the small-scale s assembly of its Polo model, at the bot- y tom of its range, near Zwickau, the g industrial town in the state of Saxony. a It is also forging ahead with construe- e tion of a large assembly plant there to y build its popular Golf family car. Its r- total investment in east Germany is s- forecast at around DM5bn, mostly on y the new plant. y Opel is not spending as much as that. r- Its investment will be around DMlbn. r Both companies, like other corporate. investors in the east, are taking advan- e tage of substantial incentives, covering e around a third of the total plant cost. It On the commercial side, Mercedes-Benz I1- (owned by Daimler-Benz) is construct- e ing a truck plant at Ludwigsfelde near e Berlin. i) Initially, Opel intended to build small n cars such as its Corsa in Eisenach, in s the state of Thuringia. Instead, it will s concentrate on its mid-range Vectra and family Astra (the successor to the d family Kadett) models. \"East Germans s are tired of the small automobile,\" says s Mr Hughes. Like the West Germans it after the Second World War, \"they (east h Germans) want more space, more car\". i- In the harsh old days of the east e German communist regime, people had Past lt: t last Ti fs lth produeAon virtually no choice. The most common vehicle was the humble little Trabant, which became a symbol of freedom after the Wall came down in November, S1989. It carried thousands of people to new lives in the west or simply to have a first-hand look at their richer neigh- I bours; the car was immortalised in the i film, \"Go Trabi Go\". Many East German I cars were decades old, having been lov- t ingly maintained by their drivers through a network of friends and col- leagues; spare parts were hard to come i by and obtaining a new car meant waiting for 10 years or more. Those days are long gone. The old east German plants have stopped prod- ucing their now unwanted models, and I the new assembly lines are being installed radly. Altogether, estimates Mr Aehim Diskmmnn, general manager of the German miotor industry associa- tion (VDA), around DMIObn will be invested In the east German automobile industry in the next four or five years. East German automobile production, totalling less than 220,000 cars a year before the collapse of the Honecker gov- ernment, will be doubled in 1994. By the end of this century, east Ger- man demand for new cars is forecast by VW and others to rise to around 700,000 units a year, achieving the 500,000 mark in 1995. According to Opel's Mr Hughes, the company calculated that by produc- ing in east Germany, it would enhance its market share; experience shows that shares are higher in areas where the cars are actually produced. Compared with the population of around 16m, cai sales are still small. \"That is growth potential,\" asserts Mr Hughes. In terms of car density, east Germany is today where west Germany was in 1970. West Germany, with a pop- ulation of some 63m, has almost one car for every two people; in east Germany, the figure is roughly one for every four. Now that east Germany has the D-Mark, its car ownership should catch up. \"We expect very, very fast growth in this market\", says Mr Hughes. Opel's plans to produce 150,000 cars a year in east Germany compared with 250,000 for VW. Other car companies are not investing in new capacity in east Germany, but Opel and VW are not the only automotive concerns involved there. BMW, which owned the Eisenach plant until the end of the Second World War, is building a machine tool plant in the area, while Robert Bosch will make components in the town.",

   "text_content" : "HONDA MOTOR has been humbled. For years Honda was the wunderkind of the world motor industry. After it leapt into car production in 1965, it grew unstoppably until it became Japan's third biggest car company, 9th largest in the world. Yet,even as the Honda Accord became the best-selling car in the US in 1989, Honda was slipping in Japan, while its competitors grabbed market share. This was a bitter pill to swallow for a company that worked hard to earn a reputa- tion as Japan's most stylish and technically innovative car maker. In March this year, Mr Nobu- hiko Kawamoto, president, announced a sweeping restructuring of the company's management in an attempt to regain the lost momentum. This was all the more surpris- ing for a company that had been praised by management gurus as d model for how to cope with rapid change. What- ever went wrong at Honda? It would be easy, and wrong, to exaggerate the depth of Honda's troubles. If anything, indeed, Honda has suffered from having succeeded too well. Honda simply outgrew La the management systems that I had proved so effective for a La relatively small, fast-growing ts company. t It is also having to face up to :o the increased complexity of it managing an enterprise that is a- genuinely multinational at a h time when consumer tastes in r its main markets are diverging. It is more difficult than ever to I- steer the company as a single t, unit from the centre. g Honda's growth figures 's speak for themselves. Honda :o manufactured 372,000 cars in i. 1970; last year it made 1.9m a- cars. The fast expansion of L sales in the 1980s also led to a it rapid rise in its numbers of :o employees, which increased t- from 55,700 to 85,000 today. Just as important as the g, pace of growth, however is the f ever-increasing complexity of .g Honda's business. Fully half of i Honda's cars are sold in the b US, with Japan taking only w about 35 per cent. The com- pany is also expanding rapidly in Europe. It owns 20 per cent of the Rover group's vehicle operations, and is building an assembly plant in Swindon. Fewer than half of Honda's employees worldwide are Japa- nese. Honda achieved this stunning success with a man- agement structure that was startling for its simplicity. Mr Soichiro Honda, the company founder who died in August this year, was an iconoclastic engineer who instinctively dis- trusted elaborate management procedures and hierarchy. He succeeded in establishing Honda's reputation for innova- tive engineering, and left a management system aimed at allowing creativity to flourish. Board members at Honda worked in a large, noisy, open- plan office, and they were not assigned individual responsi- bilities for specific areas of business. The idea was to encourage a broad outlook. While the company naturally developed its own hierarchy and division of work, the underlying philosophy was that a common outlook would encourage employees to work in the same direction without elaborate, formalised proce- dures. Honda set the pace for the Japanese car industry with the speed with which it reacted to trends in the market, and the rapidity with which it could turn out new models. However, as the company grew, and its business became more complex, Honda found its competitors were pulling ahead and that the \"one big happy family\" approach was slowing down the company. This became apparent with the development of the 1990 Accord model, in which engi- neers in the US and Japan argued over specifications. Although the car was well received in the US, Japanese buyers were lukewarm. To get the company moving again, Mr Kawamoto has split the company into three divi- sions: cars, motorcycles, and power products, which includes everything from lawn mowers to small electric gener- ators. r Mr Kawamoto and his two r chief lieutenants, Mr Soichiro i Irimajiri and Mr Yoshide 3 Munekuni, have taken direct i charge of the automotive divi- i sion and are rebuilding the t company's decision-making processes from the bottom up. r The aim is to give middle and i lower management clear i responsibilities to prevent deci- I sions from being sent up the t hierarchy where they are bounced around endlessly r among senior management. This will also mean virtually independent operations in I Honda's principal markets: the US, Japan, and Europe. ; Honda has already suc- i ceeded partially in re-polishing ' its image at home with the ) launch of its hugely popular NSX sports car, and with the i sales of the Beat, a sporty mini-car, which have helped to I reverse the decline in sales.

Once, it was enough simply to make cars that were beauti- ful and luxurious, potent and desirable or merely practical and economical. Now every new model must be seen to make as little impact as possible on the world in which it operates. Now every new model must be seen to make as little impact as possible on the world And, when a long, safe work- ing life is over, it must lend itself to being recycled into the raw materials from which a new generation of cars can be made. It is a considerable tribute to the ingenuity of the world's car industry that these aims are being achieved without debas- ing the product or making it less attractive to look at, drive or ride in. L L Take, for example, the new est S-Class Mercedes-Benz saloons. lac- They are widely held to be the cet- best cars of their kind in the world at present. Not only do ply they swish silently along the uti- German autobahn at speeds md unattainable anywhere else; cal they are also claimed to be the least polluting as well as the ust most advanced cars of their tle size. the The catalytic converters es. which take the poisonous ele- - ments out of their exhaust 61 gases reach working tempera- ture in half the time of those in E6 other cars. Some of the new S-Class Id models would easily exceed their governed top speed of 250 m kph (155 mph). But Daimler- rk- Benz brushes this fact aside as ind barely relevant. It prefers to the draw attention to the fuel effi- i a ciency and pollution-reducing be capability of the electronic management systems control- to ling their up to six-litre mar engines. ire Daimler-Benz talks, too, of as- using as few environmentally it damaging chemicals as possi- ive ble in manufacturing the new S-Class; of coding all its plastic v parts to ease eventual recycl- ,. ing; and even of using only e wood from non-threatened tree e species for interior trim. o Thus the new big Mercedes e is not only a superb machine; s it is also a good example of the i; importance all car makers are e now having to attach to envi- e ronmental friendliness. r In the volume end of the lux- ury market, Daimler-Benz, s BMW and Jaguar are now sac- !- ing a growing challenge from Daimler-Benz, BMW and Jaguar are now s facing a growing g challenge from Japan s Japanese makers, mainly a Toyota (Lexus). Honda (Acura [- Legend) and Nissan (Infiniti). g Others like Mazda and Mitsubi- c shi are squaring up to meet the I- opposition. e These Japanese cars may be short of perceived status but f they make up for it with v advanced technology. They are the equal of their generally v more expensive European c rivals in performance and :- refinement. Japanese produc- ly ers have also made a profound ie impression in the sporting high performance segment. Such as cars as the twin-turbocharged e; Nissan 300ZX and the brilliant ie all-aluminium, mid-engined re Honda NS-X are in the Porsche I- and Ferrari class for every- thing except price and prestige. x- Lower down the performance z, market, the Toyota MR2, c- Mazda MX-5 and the new n Mazda MX-3 hardtop coupe, - with a highly innovative 24- valve, V6 engine of only 1.8 litres capacity, have few obvi- ous European competitors apart from the Lotus Elan and Volkswagen Corrado. While shying away from producing large volumes of y 2+2-bodied sporting cars, a Europe's manufacturers offer ). similar performance in models i- looking exactly like the family Le hatchbacks on which they are based. e Prominent among these are it the new Citroen ZX Volcane, h 16-valve engined versions of e the Renault 19 and Fiat Tipo, y the superchaiged VW Polo and n Britain's Rover 220 GT. d Most of the cars bought in Europe are in the supermini, small-medium and medium- size classes, respectively typi- fied by the Renault Clio, VW Golf and Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra). The trend has been for all new models in these classes to be a little big- ger, more powerful, better equipped and dearer than their predecessors. This has opened a potential gap in that part of the market where price is all-important. Responding to public pressure, far less emphasis is being put on sheer performance As a result, a basic version of the Renault 5 has been kept in production as a price leader, although that model has been succeeded by the Clio. Peug- eot's latest product is a smaller, lighter and cheaper car than its perennially suc- cessful 205. Higher up the market, the introduction of larger and more sophisticated new models has increased the possibilities of substitution. The new Audi 80 and 100 models are both bigger and considerably better than the cars they replace. It is foresee- able that many 100 owners will find the new 80 models most acceptable substitutes. They offer virtually every- thing the larger 100s provide in terms of performance and refinement. All they lack is the bulk. As traffic becomes ever more congested, this is a bonus and a positive incentive to trade down in size but in noth- ing else. On very long journeys with a full load of people and luggage, the attraction of driving a large car is obvious. But for everyday use, probably by the driver alone, small or at any rate smaller has become beau- tiful, especially when the car still has power steering, auto- matic transmission and per- haps air conditioning. The Audi 80s are only one example of this new generation of modestly dimensioned, luxu riously furnished and compre- hensively equipped cars. Much the same can be said of the BMW 3-series, the Rover 200/ 400 and the new front-wheel driven Volvo 850 GLT, which has perhaps the best driving characteristics of any car Volvo has ever made. There are many others, especially from Japanese makers. Responding to the pressure of public and official opinion, far less emphasis is being put on sheer performance. Only a handful of small volume mak- ers of ultra-fast cars for the wealthy now boast of 300 kmh (186 mph) maximum speeds that are, mercifully, both ille- gal and for all practical pur- poses, unattainable even on the German autobahnen. Instead, more emphasis is being put on the standard fit- ment of catalytic converters and of the safety benefits of anti-lock braking systems, of the availability of electronic traction control systems or full-time four wheel drive.

   "text_content" : "TO LOOK at the statistics, 1991 has been a dull ..S (.... Japan's car makeS,.8 production in the first-baW of. . the year fell by 2.1 per ceit,' with the mainstream market for small cars hit hardest. For the first time in anyone's mem- ory, all three of the world's principal car markets - Japan, i the US and Europe - have i slowed down at the same time. i Car company earnings will be affected as a result. Nissan, Japan's second biggest car i maker, said last month it was i feeling the pressure so much i that it would cut capital spend- ing by delaying the start of i some projects. But it would be wrong to see i the deceleration this year as 1 anything more than a bump in , the road. While the momentum i I of the industry may have rlored, it is still hurtling for- -ward with new model designs and technology that will pose a stiff challenge to the world's vehicle makers. The new products are aimed first at gaining a bigger share of the Japanese market. As in the past, winning on the home turf will almost certainly be the prelude to stronger sales abroad. Japan's car makers are aim- ing for the allegiance of increasingly affluent and fash- ion-conscious consumers. Nis- san, once thought among the dullest of car designers, spot- lighted this trend in 1987 with its Cima model luxury car. Until then, large luxury cars were sold almost exclusively as executive cars for corporate fleets. The new car revolutionised Nissan's public image, and helped reverse years of decline in its Japanese market share. The competition however was quick to respond. \"The car makers now feel that styling is a very important part of selling cars,\" says Mr Keith Donaldson, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Indeed, this year, with a dearth of new models, Nissan sales have sagged. Toyota, which dominates the Japanese market with a share of more than 40 per cent, fol- lowed in the wake of Nissan and has had an even bigger winner with its Lexus marque. Last year Mitsubishi Motor picked up market share after the launch of its Diamante model, while Mazda has been swamped with orders for its Sentia luxury saloon, which came on the market only in July. Honda, Japan's traditional leader in both engine technol- ogy and design, has been left behind in the race for boldly- designed luxury vehicles and has decisively lost its tradi- tional third place standing in this sector of the Japanese market to Mitsubishi. The Honda Accord, which was relaunched in 1990, lacked the innovative styling offered by its competitors. The car was poorly received in Japan (although it was a big hit in the US) and Honda's image at home has suffered as a result. Yet Japanese car companies are in a fast-moving race with competitors attacking each other at many different points. A slump in Honda sales has been reversed in recent months Europe is seen as the main battleground for the 1990s by the introduction of a sporty minicar, the Beat, and by spe- cial editions of the Civic, its basic economy car, loaded with extra features. More luxurious versions of the Accord have also been selling well and the launch of a completely rede- signed Civic this month and the Prelude model should also help to revive Honda's fortunes by pandering to Japanese con- sumers' tastes for new models. The battle to capture the lux- ury end of the Japanese mar- ket has put the country's car makers in a better position to compete against luxury car makers overseas, particularly in the US, where they have already scored winning punches against European imports. In July, for the first time ever, Toyota's exus and Nissan's Infinity outsold BMW and Mercedes. Toyota and Nissan have set up separate distribution chan- nels for the upmarket cars. Competition should heat up as Mazda and Mitsubishi plan to set up luxury distribution channels of their own in the US. B compairison, Jopanmese cm ers have made fewer inroas in the European mar- ket, claiming a total market share of 11.8 per cent as opposed to 27.8 per cent in the US. But that is changing rap- idly, as Japanese manufactur- ing capacity in Europe grows. Europe is widely seen as the main battleground for the 1990s. The battle will be fought over styling, performance, and price. But Japanese companies are increasingly directing research and development pro- grammes toward coping with stricter environmental and safety standards. As a possible taste of things to come, on con- secutive days in late July, both Honda and Mitsubishi announced the development of engines that offer up to 20 per cent higher efficiency with no significant loss of performance. They will be available in mod- els sold this autumn. Although there are signifi- cant differences between the two engine designs, both burn an air fuel mixture that is lean, with a low fuel content. The lean burn allows more com- plete and cleaner combustion, although lean air fuel mixtures are more difficult to ignite. The two companies overcame this problem by redesigning valves and the combustion chamber. The race to stay ahead, how- ever, is going to be an expen- sive one that will not be easy to fund unless sales pick up. Although sales of full-sized cars (over 2000cc) rose by 39.2 per cent in the first half of the year, and mini-car sales grew by 19.4 per cent, the mainstay of the market, small cars, saw an 11.8 per cent drop. Overall domestic sales dipped by 3.3 per cent. Higher interest rates and the impossibility of raising equity funding because of the depressed Japanese stock mar- ket have bitten into cash bal- ances. The leading companies are still strong financially, but like Nissan they are having to ask much tougher questions about capital budgets. The cost of capital in Japan is unlikely to be as cheap as it was in the mid-1960 for a long time, if ever. And with serious labour shortage hitting the industry, making automoble in Japan is becoming even more capital- intensive.",

   "text_content" : "THE Big Three Detroit motor manufacturers, still bleeding red ink from the US recession of the past year, are beginning to make cautiously optimistic noises about recovery. Yet any celebrations ought to be extremely muted, for the industry still faces daunting long-term problems as it struggles to combat ever more intense Japa- nese competition. The Big Three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - collectively lost almost $4bn in the first half of this year as the industry went through its worst downturn in a decade, and none of the companies is expected to return to the black for 1991 as a whole. In the first seven months of this year, US car and light truck sales totalled 7.34m vehicles, down from 8.48m in the same period of 1990, and while there are tentative signs of an upturn in demand, the recov- ery is likely to be very gradual. GM is forecasting 1992 industry-wide sales some 10 per cent higher than this year, of 13.5m to 14m vehicles, but still below the long-term trend in volume growth. There is, moreover, precious little hope of demand coming into bal- ance with manufacturing capacity in the near future, and that is likely to keep downward pressure on vehicle prices. Over the past year manufacturers have had to offer rebates averaging $1,000 or more to maintain their market position. Japanese manufacturers, who have set up so-called \"transplant\" assembly plants across the US over the pastdecade, are continuing to expand capacity as they make deeper and deeper inroads into the market. Detroit, for its part, has been slow to cut capacity in line with its reduced market share. The top-selling car in the US is Japanese - the Honda Accord - and Japanese models now account for more than 30 per cent of the US market - including Japanese cars sold through American companies. Their penetration of the market is much more serious than even that figure suggests. For about 35 per cent of the US car market consists of heavily discounted sales to fleet rental companies, which have close ties to the Big Three. When those are excluded, Japanese cars account for well over 40 per cent of the market, and European and Korean products take the total up to around 50 per cent. Moreover, Japanese cars are par- ticularly popular among younger buyers and on the trend-setting West Coast. The implication is that as older Americans die, their brand loyalty will go with them and Japa- nese penetration will increase. That said, the Japanese are far from foolproof - they too have had to introduce discounts on their vehicles and Nissan, in particular, has been finding the US market very diffcult. The once arrogant US companies have also responded vig- orously over the past few years to the Japanese threat, but it is ques- tionable whether they are moving sufficiently far or fast to shore up their position. Elements in their counter-offensive include: * Capacity cuts. Worldwide, pro- duction capacity is estimated to exceed demand by some 8m units a year - but some 6m of those units are in, or aimed at, the North Amer- ican market. All of the Big Three have cut capacity, but more still needs to go. Ford has been boldest, with a large rationalisation in the r- late 1980s, and its plants are now r estimated by analysts to be running g at near 80 per cent of capacity. How- it ever, the figure for. Chrysler is d around 66 per cent a for GM is a i- mere 55 per cent. G s new chair- man, Mr Robert Stempel, has r pledged to balance capacity with r Any celebrations ougM to be extremely muted, s for the Industry still faces daunting long-term problems p demand by the end of 1992, r although company officials recently said this could stretch into 1993. I- Plant closures are a matter of del- o icate negotiation with the the a United Auto Workers Union, and s the industry's contracts with the .- union restrict the cost-savings that e can be achieved in this area. GM 11 last year signed a pattern-setting t, three-year deal which guaranteed e workers much of their salaries and v benefits whether or not they g worked. r- At same time, to shut capacity is a to finally admit a permanent loss of a markets to the Japanese, and the r- US manufacturers may be unwilling a to concede so much ground just yet. h m Plant efficiency is also much - Improved - and well ahead of most European rivals - with Ford again leading the way. Some of its assem- bly works - notably its Atlanta, i Georgia, plant - are now regarded by industry analysts as almost as efficient as those of its best Japa- nese rivals, thanks to the implemen- a tation of better production methods 1, and good labour relations. Chrysler y and GM still have substantial ground to catch up. I- But the Japanese also have the e advantage of green-field sites in d rural areas of the US with relatively e cheap, young labour. The US comn- it panies have also been fundamen- i tally re-evaluating the way they g organise their businesses, learning d from joint venture operations they i have been running with the Japa- icey nose. There has been a gradual movement towards the \"lean\" man- r is ufacturing techniques pioneered in i of Japan, involving changes in rela- the tions with suppliers, between corpo- ing rate departments, managers and ret. workers, and In attitudes to the cus- ich tomer. ost The reliability and styling of sin American vehicles is also much an- improved, and the quality gap sep- ita, arating them from the Japanese has led narrowed, if not disappeared as entirely. However, Detroit is still pa- much slower than its Japanese en- rivals in bringing new products to Ads market - a serious deficiency in a ler world where consumer tastes and ial technology are changing so rapidly and the ability to snatch control of the niche markets is an important in ingredient of success. ely But in spite of all these changes, nm- the US motor manufacturers them- en- selves seem lacking in confidence iey about their ability to catch the Jap- ing anese. A recent survey of US indus- ley try leaders by consultants Ernst & pa- Young and the University of Michi- gan asked them to rank eight com- panies in competitiveness now and in the year 2000. The consensus was that while most US car makers would continue j to improve their competitiveness, the Japanese would also get better and in many key areas continue to set standards. At the turn of the 1 century, said the business leaders, i- three Japanese companies - a Toyota, Honda and Nissan - would i- remain the most competitive, fol- o- lowed by General Motors and Ford d in equal fourth place. i- E Protectionism. Faced with all these pressures, US manufacturers if are seeking political help to stem h the Japanese advance. An impor- >- tant landmark came last June when s the Big Three, in a rare display of a co-operation, filed an anti-dumping I suit against Japanese producers of e mini-vans, claiming these are being o sold in the US market below cost. If a that suit is successful, others seem I sure to follow, particularly at the y luxury end of the US market, where if the Japanese have been making big It inroads. The industry has also been lobby- i, ing Congressmen for action to limit i- Japanese sales in the US and for e relief from costs which Detroit says )- gives its rivals a head-start. These i- include high US health-care costs k and onerous safety, clean-air and I- fuel economy regulations.",

   "text_content" : "\"THE amazing new car from Ohio that goes around corners, up hills and overseas.\" Thus has Honda Motor, the Japanese car manufacturer, been proudly advertising a new Accord station wagon built at its plant in Marysville, Ohio. It is the first Japanese car to be designed and built solely in the US - although the basic sedan from which it was derived was designed in Japan - and some of the vehicles are being exported to Europe and even Japan itself. The advertising campaign underlines the anxiety of the Japanese car mhnufacturers who have set up eight factories (so-called \"transplants\") in the US to be seen as American companies at a time. when their ever-increasing advances are again setting off protection- ist noises in Detroit. And the fact that the car was designed and built in the US illustrates a new trend in the Japanese companies' strategy: by researching, engineering and designing their cars in America, as well as building them in the country, the Japa- nese are getting closer to the consumer and improving their marketing abilities, as well as speeding up the time it takes to bring products to market. And in the intensely competi- tive 1990s, these could prove crucial advantages as manufac- turers respond to fast-changing consumer tastes. The past decade has revolu- tionised the Japanese role in the US car industry. The late 1970s saw the first big burst of expansion: thanks to the two successive Middle East oil cri- ses, which switched the fash- ion to smaller, fuel efficient cars, Japanese manufacturers managed to capture some 17 1 t L 1 i 1 I 1 s L L 1 Toyota Prwvla: facing US dumping charges - per cent of the US car market by the turn of the decade, is entirely through imports. r However, rising US protec- is tionist sentiment led to volun- v: tary import restraints and a tg realisation by Japanese compa- n nies that for further expansion g they would need to set up man- - ufacturing facilities in the US. is Honda was the first in, opening ir its Marysville plant in 1982, but is by the middle of the decade it s was being followed by Nissan, t. Toyota and other Asian manu - facturers, some working alone r and some in joint ventures c- with US companies. Ig By the end of last year, nine Japanese and one Korean com- - pany had taken some 29 per n cent of the car market, and 24.9 3 per cent of the total truck and f car market, up from 27.1 per o cent and 23.1 per cent in 1989. i- When vehicles engineered by - the Japanese, but sold by US it companies are included, the *s total car total jumped to 1 around 32 per cent last year. t And among the larger manu- facturers, sales from transplant operations had overtaken, or were on the way to overtaking, their imports. The market I share gains seem set to con- * tinue as they increase US pro- i duction over the next few years and expand their distri- . bution network - particularly Sin the Midwest, which remains t a sales heartland for the Amer- t ican Big Three. The speed of the advance has so alarmed their American i rivals that several leading Detroit figures and the United Auto Workers Union have been i calling for new import quotas, or even a cap on the total Japa- r nese share of the US market. ) This implies a huge cut in I the Japanese import quota, r which stands at 2.3m units a . year. However, for the past r four years Japanese imports i have fallen well below that level - 1.7m units in 1990 - because of the build-up of pro- duction from the transplants. For many years Detroit crit- ics argued that transplants would merely be assembly plants employing semi-skilled labour, leaving the most criti- cal jobs to be done in Japan. But while this may prove the case for some smaller manufac- turers, the argument hardly stands up in the case of the Japanese Big Three - Honda, Nissan and Toyota - who have turned their US operations into fully-fledged, stand-alone manufacturers . They now have extensive US engineering and design facili- ties. The local content of their vehicles is high - albeit much of it from Japanese transplant parts companies. Honda, for example, claims around 75 per cent local content for parts and components. However, many dies, tools and large components, such as engines, are imported, though here too the trend over the next few years will be to manu- facture or buy locally. Political pressures apart, market-place competition is pushing the Japanese in this direction. In the US, as in Japan, their plants use \"just in time\" manufacturing tech- niques and require very close co-operation with parts suppli- ers. For this to work most effi- ciently, lines of communication need to be short. At present the Japanese transplants appear to have a substantial manufacturing cost advantage over the best of their American opponents - The Honda advertising campaign underlines the anxiety of Japanese car manufacturers and a huge advantage com- pared to the worst Detroit plants. Contributory factors include their green field sites, their generally younger, non-union labour forces, their temporary freedom from pension costs and their production tech- niques. But the Americans have been closing the gap on factory competitiveness, and to maintain their edge as the 1990s progress the transplants will need the flexibility that local autonomy can bring. It would be wrong, however, to suggest that the transplants are invincible. Numerous teething problems at several of them have encouraged Detroit executives in their belief that the Asian advance can be halted. The two most successful have been Honda and Toyota. Honda makes the most popular car in the US, the Accord, and in the first seven months of this year the group accounted for some 9.4 per cent of the US car market. Toyota, the largest car group in Japan, accounted for 8.7 per cent. Both compa- nies have been increasing their market share although in com- mon with their US rivals they have also been hit by falling volume because of the reces- son. They have had to follow Detroit's lead and offer large discounts to move models off the showroom floor. Nissan, however, has sus- fered a succession of problems in the -US. Styling mistakes in the early Isa gave its cars a dull image that it has not entirely shaken off and last year it had to pull its Axes mini-van off the market became it ailed to sell. The group's US sales peaked n 1985 at 8o000 cars and truAck and then nose-dived In the late 196s.

Under Mr Robert Stempel, who took over as chairman in July last year, the company has been clawing back US mar- ket share and moving faster to cut costs and reduce its heavy burden of excess manufactur- ing capacity. Mr Stempel should not get all the credit for this. Many of the programmes from which the group is starting to benefit were put in place under his predecessor, the controversial Mr Roger Smith, who tried to force change on the sprawling group by throwing money at its problems. And the severe impact of the US recession over the past 12 months has forced the group to accelerate change, whether or not it likes it. In the first six months of this year GM lost $1.2bn and Wall Street expects it to remain in the red for the year as a whole, in spite of signs of a gradual recovery in the US economy and vehicle market. However, Mr Stempel so far seems much more suc- cessful than his predecessor in gaining the support of GM's workforce for belt-tightening and new working methods. This is partly because of his down-to-earth personality, and partly because he made clear early on that all GM's employ- ees - managers included - were going to share in its pain. That is a distinct contrast to the 1980s when the group gained a reputation for demanding sacrifices from the rank and file while top execu- tives continued to reap gener- ous pay and perks. Yet it was The severe impact of the US recession over the past 12 months has forced the group to accelerate change during that decade that the once arrogant GM got its comeuppance. Unprepared for the Japanese onslaught against the US market, it saw its share of the car market drop from some 46 per cent at the start of the decade to around 35 per cent at the end. However, GM seems to have drawn a line, decided it would defend the 35 per cent floor at any cost, and over the past year it has started to win back customers. In the first six months of 1991 it held 36.7 per cent of the car market and aims to take this to 40 per cent over the next couple of years. That is going to be tough, the immense competition US and Japanese rivals. GM's first challenge is to pro- duce quality vehicles that excite customers, and this it now be starting to do, a very pfguamme of new model Ii One of the group's first suc- cesess a new luxury sedan, the Park Avenue, which has been a ig hit for GMs Buick division, bucing the recession- ary downturn. has been ln ' market shar, thanks to a of mrevamp of its prodct line and marketing However, GM remains the hi cot producer of te US t ,wa us aciorie on aver ag ig fr loaer than those f its rivals tuo tn out vehicles.

These have been re-organised along the more efficient lines found at rival Japanese companies. And the group has experi- mented with an entirely new approach to car building at the plant in Tennessee which builds its new Saturn small car - a model conceived in the early 1980s as an all-out US attempt to beat the Japanese in the small car market. Saturn vehicles went on sale for the first time last autumn but so far the project has been far from a resounding success. The Saturn plant has a produc- tion capacity of 1,200 cars a day but production glitches - notably problems with the car's plastic body - mean that output has been running at about half that level. Those consumers who have managed to buy the cars seem pretty pleased with them, but Saturn's shaky start has not enhanced GM's image and it will be years - if ever - before the much-hyped project reaches profitability. A second big problem for GM is that its manufacturing capacity far exceeds demand for its products. The company took a $Imbn write-off last year to cover the cost of closing seven North American facto- ries and Mr Stump pledged to be running al its plants at full Buck has been gaining market share, mamks to a revamp of its product he capacty by the end of next year.

   "text_content" : "CALIFORNIA, the US's most populous and richest state, is a cru- cial makt for expensive cars. But California is also where the world's first laws were enacted to control the emission of noxious gases from car exhausts, and since the late 1960s those laws have been progres- sively tightened. It is not, however, merely that California sets its own exhaust emission standards. What makes its standards crucially important is that they have usually been adopted, after a delay of one or two years, as US Federal standards. That, in turn, has been enough to ensure their adoption in other coun- tries, including Japan, which suffer severe air quality problems or which, like Sweden, are acutely ecology-conscious. The process has sometimes extended over a long period. The Calfornian regulations of 1980 were generally applied to all new cars sold in the US from the 1983 model year, and in Japan from shortly afterwards; but those same stan- dards will not apply to all new cars sold in the EC until January 1, 1993. It bs unlikely, however, that it will take nearly 15 years for subsequent Californian initiatives to be embraced in Europe. The Germans in particular, along with the Swiss and the Scandinavians, are keen to make more progress in this direc- tion. The so-called \"US83\" regulations are significant because they involve the large additional costs of an emission control system. They can only be met, at least within the foreseeable state of tech- nology, by fitting a catalytic con- verter within which precious metals induce noxious fumes (carbon mon- oxide, unburned hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen) either to oxidise or to decompose into harmless - in a toxic sense at least - carbon diox- ide, water vapour and nitrogen. A typical catalytic converter costs perhaps Â£100 but it is only the beginning. For the converter to work properly, the contents of the exhaust gases entering it need to be carefully controlled. The tempera- ture must be correct (most convert- ers \"light off\" at around 300degC, but begin to suffer if they get too hot) and there must be enough residual oxygen to permit the oxidi- sation process to take place. These requirements can be met only b fitting the engine with an electroni- Scally-controled fuel injection sys- Â· tem, adding at least another Â£100 by a comparison with a system using a carburettor. t The reason the EC took longer * than any other part of the industria- Slised world to bite the bullet of this i extra cost was political Its ecologi- - cal hawks, the Germans and their , allies, spent years convincing those D governments voted into office by i the owners of small, cheap cars - the Italians, the French and to a degree the British - that there was a really no alternative. Now the EC a must look to the next stage, because SCalifornia has not stood -still and the rest of the world is already fol- a lowing. The scene is shifting. It is now widely acknowledged that the emis- sion standards set for California for a model year 1993, which are likely to k become the \"US94\" standard and - which involve further reductions of i both unburned hydrocarbons and of oxides ontioe rersent someof thing dome to Tof what can be achieved with a conventional r engine. In most cases the US liUm- a its can be net by further refine- ment ofexiting systems: by fitting r catalytic cnerters with SFleets of pethanolfuelled r car are being run In California by US car makers and Japanese and German importers e heaters to bring them more quickly I to operating temperature, by recir- culating a proportion of exhaust gas back to the engine intake, and simi- Slar measures which will not, by and large, involve an incremental cost r like that of adopting the catalytic o converter and electronic fuel injec- I tion. California is not, contrary to f some fears, about to tighten overall emission standards to the point where its citizens will have to junk their cars and return to public transport or the bicycle (though the diesel engine manufacturers still have some technical problems to solve in the area of particulate emissions). Instead, it appears to have decided that the most realistic way to achieve further reductions in emissions is to adopt what might be called a \"proportional\" approach. Accordingly, the state has already proposed that by a series of target dates stretching into the 21st cen- tury, sales of new vehicles should include a proportion of what are defined as Low Emission Vehicles (LEVs) and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs). The LEVs will use alternative fuels, most probably methanol, which will among other things begin to reduce vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide. California is as aware as anywhere of the Green- house Effect. Fleets of methanol-fuelled test cars are already bfng run in the state by the \"big three\" American car manufacturers, and the big Jap- anese and German importers. The ZEVs will inevitably be electrically- powered. The new Californian approach poses two problems for the car man- ufacturers, who will have to ensure that their sales in California from (about) 1998 will have to include the requisite proportion of LEVs and ZEVs. First, they will have to develop suitable vehicles, a process which is already under way: GM, for instance, has shown a series of attractive electrically-powered pro- totypes and talked seriously about putting them into small-scale pro- duction, and BMW has announced its own variation on the theme. The manufacturers' second prob- lem is that almost certainly, they will need to \"buy\" their LEV and especially ZEV sales. The limited range and performance of electric cars makes them unattractive unless they can be sold cheaply, and the cost figures emerging from technical discussion look anything but cheap. Consequently, it seems certain that pricing policy will in effect involve conventional cars subsidising electric vehicles. This will be no problem as long as the required proportion of ZEVs is small If it rises to a significant level, anythin over 10 'per cent, then market distortions will begin to arise. The simplistic assumption that by the year 2010 every Caifor- nian household will have a ZEV to take into town and a conventional car (or LEV) for long journeys takes no account of cost differen- tials - Just as most calculations of electric vehicle running costs assume the exclusive use of cheap off-peak power; In this respect, California is doing the rest of the world a service: if the crunch comes (bearing in mind that the state has so far adroitly avoided any ultimate confrontation with either its highly motorised popula- tion or those who provide the vehicles) then we shall all be in a position to learn. The most likely conclusion, however, is that Calif- ornia will continue to point the way in which the rest of the mobile world will develop, after an inevita- ble interval. Jeff Daniels",

   "text_content" : "SOUTH KOREA'S car manufacturers are getting back on track after a protracted stay in the pits. Exports, which slumped so sharply in the past few years, are recovering, while the domestic market continues to show strong growth. Improved design and technology are also apparent in the host of new models which have been tak- ing to the streets. Total production for the six Korean car manufacturers reached 517,128 units in the first half of the year, an increase of 19 per cent over the comparable period last year. Exports increased by an impressive 35 per cent to 164.000 units, while domestic sales rose by almost 20 per cent to 342,953 units. There are several reasons for the, improvement. On the earside, the Korean car a finfacturers have had a fair d iriie of success in diversify- ing sales away from the flag- ging UIS market. Eastern Europe, south-east Asia and Wd.3iddle East have seen the st-, N'Mt gains. e same time;.strilkMS alabour disputes at the car manufacturers and at their component suppliers, which have caused serious disruption every year since 1987, have been less frequent this year. As a result, production has been smoother and there have been fewer quality problems which have dogged overseas sales in recent years. On the domestic side, prog- ress has also been steady. The continued rise in South Koreans' disposable incomes has created ready customers for the new models which have been rolling off the production line. Sales of just under 1.11m are expected in the Korean market for the full year. But beneath the picture of improved performance there remain a series of challenges which must be overcome. For all the factors which lie behind the increases in production and exports there are caveats which may take some of the wind from the Korean car mak- ers' sails. In the case of the new mar- kets, for example, there are limits to the amount of growth which can be expected. Eastern European countries, in particu- lar, face constraints on hard currency and may find it diffm- cult to maintain their appetite for imported cars. \"I don't believe we will con- tinue to see the same growth from eastern Europe,\" says Mr N.M. Kim, managing director of export marketing at Hyun- dai Motors, Korea's largest car maker. For the time being, eastern Europe along with south-east Asia and the Middle East all provide valuable new outlets for Korean manufacturers. But they will never represent an alternative to the US - which was always Korea's single big- gest export market. In this respect, the news is not particularly encouraging. Korean manufacturers con- tinue to suffer from a protracted downturn in the American market. Production at Hyundai's Canadian plant - which supplies the Sonata to the US market is running at less than 50 per cent capacity while shipments from Korea remain well below their 1987 and 1988 levels. \"Everyone is saying that the US economy is starting to recover,\" says Mr Kin. \"But I don't see any improvement in the car market yet.\" The Hyundai executive is more optimistic about labour relations. His co any, like,. midit of Korean try exp --rienced a uWrpri&e f t -\" 4^eagi in30asn. '^ Hyundal Elanra: new launch In US and Europe \"The overall trend is much better,\" says Mr Kim. \"This is perhaps the turning point.\" Executives at Kia Motors, the second largest manufac- turer are, however, unlikely to agree. A protracted labour dis- pute in July halted production for several weeks and caused a downturn in year-on-year pro- duction figures for the Indus- try as a whole in that month. The disruption at Kia shows that the risk of labour unrest has not been removed. But it also suggests, on a more encouraging note, that there is a process at work which is creating improved workplace relations. Unlike Hyundai and Daewoo Motors - a 50/50 joint venture with General Motors - Kia has hitherto seen very few indus- trial disputes. The fact that it is now experiencing a strike, while its counterparts are enjoying relative industrial peace, suggests that there is a ment and labour hich ia executives are only just con- fronting. Mr Lee Dong Hwa, general manager of the Korea Automo- bile Manufacturers' Associa- tion, subscribes to this view. \"Management and labour have learned that there is little to gain from strikes. They are now more experienced in solv- ing problems through negotia- tion.\" With the improvement in labour relations, executives at Korean car companies are now able to devote more time to the problems of upgrading effi- ciency and productivity and enhancing design and quality. Here too, there has been progress. The new cars which have been rolling off Korean production lines - from the sporty Hyundai Scoupe to the Daewoo Espero Saloon - are a long way removed from the humble Pony which spear- headed Korea's move into the international car market in 1986. Certain models of the Scoupe are also fitted with an engine developed by Hyundai earlier this year. Rut in terms of engineering ~andCdUtiLtechnology the an uarers still todo with their international, and particularly Japanese, rivals. A recent report by Kia Eco- nomic Research Institute, a respected think tank on the local automobile industry, argued that failure to increase productivity in line with Japa- nese manufacturers was erod- ing the competitiveness of the Korean carmakers. It cited the fact that a four- door Hyundai Excel has seen its price in the US increase from $7,890 to $8,115 over the past year. The price of a Toyota Tercel, one of the Excel's competitors has, by contrast, fallen from $9,198 to $8,996. Reduced wage increases and the introduction of new pro- duction lines by several of the Korean car makers should help reverse this erosion in competi- tiveness. Along with continued improvements in technology and design capabilities these are the principal factors which will determine whether the Korean car industry can resume its inroads into inter- national markets.",

   "text_content" : "BY ANY standards, the Australian car industry is guilty of one of the world's great missed opportunities. In the late 1950s, when Japan was still recovering industrially and psychologically from the effects of the Second World War, Australia was the world's seventh largest car maker, and the biggest in Asia. That combination, combined with the country's high stan- dard of living and access to international capital, provided the Australian industry with an opportunity to develop a big exporting industry. It never happened. A little over 30 years later, Australia produces only about 1 per cent of annual global car production of around 36m units, roughly equivalent to a month's pro- duction for one of the major Japanese manufacturers. The opportunity was missed because Australia chose to insulate its economy behind high tariff walls and import quotas, rather than face aggressive competition in world markets. The strategy encouraged for- eign manufacturers to set up small-scale assembly plants to produce vehicles for the grow- ing domestic market. As a result, Australia's 17m people are served by five domestic car makers, Ford and General Motors' Holden's Automotive (GMHA) of the US, and Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi of Japan. But while the five companies competed strongly for domestic sales, the lack of international competition led to a high cost structure which depended on protection for its survival. This delicately structured house of cards began to tumble in 1984, when Mr Bob Hawke's recently elected Labor govern- ment began deregulating and opening up the Australian economy across the board. In the car industry, the changes took the form of the Button Car Plan, named after Senator John Button, the Industry Minister who was its chief architect and regulator. The plan was based on the belief that the existing struc- ture of the industry - five manufacturers producing 13 models with annual production runs averaging 28,000, but in some case below 10,000 - was unsustainable in an open mar- ket economy. The solution, Mr Button and the car makers agreed, was for protection to be progressively reduced, gradually increasing the pressure for more efficient production through rationalisa- tion of the model range and cooperation between manufac- tuers. Under the first stage of the plan, tariff protection has been cut from a nominal rate of 57.5 per cent in 1985 to 37.5 per cent, and will fall to 35 per cent in January. In addition, Import quotas have been abolished, together with an 85 per cent local content scheme for domestically produced cars. The plan also provides an export facilitation scheme under which manufacturers are encouraged to increase pro- duction runs of more popular models in return for reductions on tariffs on imported compo- nents. So far, the plan has produced mixed results. It has succeeded in reducing the number of models being manufactured from 13 to eight, all of which have production runs of more than 20,000. But average pro- duction is still only 46,000 - low by world standards. There have also been two co- operative agreements - a productlsharing arrangement by Ford and Nissan which has increased capacity utilisation at several plants, and a merger between Toyota and GMHA under which both companies' production will be owned by a single jointly-owned holding company. However, the joint venture agreement has yet to be imple- t mented, and there has been lit- r tie plant rationalisation - no assembly plants have been I closed since GMHA shut its ) Queensland plant in 1985. i Exports are up 112 per cent since 1985, largely thanks to r shipments to the US of Ford's i open-top Capri, but total vol- ume remains insignificant at 22,478. There are also doubts I about the viability of export I sales without the import r savings provided by the export I facilitation scheme. L Most importantly, the differ- ential between Australian and Japanese production costs is still around 50 per cent - enough to wipe out the domes- .tic industry in a relatively L open market. t Against this background of i slow progress, the government i decided earlier this year to r tighten the efficiency squeeze L on the industry. Mr Hawke ' announced in May that tariff I protection would be cut by 2.5 t percentage points a year from next year, to a target of 15 per > cent by 2000. The policy tightening was t opposed by all five carmakers, a some of whom hinted they a might be forced to end Austra- s lian production if protection was reduced further. None has It yet acted on the threat, but Mr a Norman Iddles, Toyoya Austra- s lia's vice-president for finance 1- and planning, spoke for many t when he warned recently that s the industry would \"change t dramatically\" in the next t decade. t In Mr Iddles' words, the manufacturers face a choice between quitting Australian 1 manufacturing and cutting s costs through heavy capital * investment and labour reform. i- So far, only Toyota has com- y mitted itself to significant capi- tal investment, although its f plans to spend A$420m on a t new manufacturing plant in a Melbourne will also benefit e GMHA through the joint ven- e ture agreement. f Ford appears undecided. Mr 5 Jac Nasser, president of Ford i Australia, says the company r will continue to manufacture the Australian-designed Falcon B until at least 1998, but Mr Har. old Poling, chairman of Ford's US parent, says the group will not decide for a couple of years whether long-term manufactur- ing in Australia is viable. Nissan and Mitsubishi have both said they intend to con- tinue building cars in Austra- lia for the foreseeable future. However, Nissan has accumu- lated losses of A$500m over the past 15 years, and has been hit hard by a fall in prices caused by the Button Plan. Mitsubishi makes only one model in Aus- tralia. In the short term, the manu- facturers are suffering badly from the combined effects of recession and tariff reduction: Nissan made a record A$125m net loss on domestic Austra- lian operations last year, while Ford lost A$82m, and Mitsubi- shi's net profit was down from AS41m to A$13m. Toyota and GMHA have not yet revealed results. In the longer term, they will need patience and deep pockets to survive. Mr Bill Scales, chairman of the Automotive Industry Authority, a govern- ment advisory body, says all five manufacturers can survive if they make the right invest- ment and marketing decisions. Senator Button appears less confident: he has been talking in terms of three survivors. Kevin Brown",
