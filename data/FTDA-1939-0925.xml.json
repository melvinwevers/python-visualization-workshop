SATURDAY Afternoon. In view of the result of the Treasury bill tender yesterday it was not sur- prising that the undertone for short- dated maturities should have been easier during this morning's short session. Business was of modest dimensions only and, as is often the case, the clearing banks were not active buyers of bills for cash. On the other hand, they intimated that they would be keen buyers next week. Actual rates were not indicated, but 3 per cent. to under was thought likely for October and November dates, and 3 per cent. to over for December maturities. There were buyers of \"hot\" Treasury bills at 3Ys per cent. Leading houses quoted 3% per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts, but not many commercial bills were coming for- ward. There was little or no calling in the Money market, so that loan conditions were very easy. Fresh accommodation over the week-end was available at 2% per cent. in non-clearing quarters. The clear- ing banks adhered to their usual charges of 3 and 3% per cent. for loans against bills and bonds respectively. _ I)IICOUL'N PR.H CENT. Loas PEk CENT. Bank Bills FineTradeBills Day.

Friday's quotations were 168s per fine ounce for gold and 23:l'd per ounce for cash and forward silver. Belga Cheapens A further depreciation in the Belgian belga was the principal feature in the offi- cial list of exchanges to-day, the rate in Brussels advancing to 23.55. Dutch guilders, however, were maintained at yes- terday's revised rate of 7.50. Argentine pesos, on the other hand, appreciated once more to 16.70. In the \"free\" market Italian lira suffered a further setback to 77%, while the Uruguayan peso weakened to 23d middle and the Shanghai dollar to 4%d. The U.S. dollar was again called $4.03.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 24th Sept. The Stock Market closed irregularly higher on Saturday in the slowest trading since the war began, turnover for the two- hour session totalling only 560,000 shares. The Dow-Jones Industrials final average improved 0.42 to 152.99 and Rails 0.28 to 33.34, but Utilities eased 0.07 to 24.63. Of 684 stocks dealt in, 288 rose, 205 declined and 191 were unchanged. Although Bethlehem Steel rallied % to 92', other Steel shares made little response to the greater mill activity. Mills in the Pittsburg area are scheduled to start this week 4% full points more at 77.5 per cent. of capacity, in the Chicago district 5.4 points up at 82 per cent. and in the Youngstown area 2 points higher at 80 per cent. The country's brass mills are work- ing at 100 per cent. of capacity for the first time since the world war. Rail and Rail Equipment shares were helped by forecasts of a further sharp increase in weekly freight loadings. Elec- tric Equipments and Oils showed scattered gains. The recently tardy Merchandis- ings were in some demand. Aircrafts and Chemicals were undecided, while Utilities were dull throughout. Tobaccos were inclined to ease on fears that the local situation regarding cigarette taxation will spread further. In the Bond market U.S. Governments rallied from the previous weakness engendered by the withdrawal of Federal Reserve support, while second-grade Rail- road bonds continued to rise and other Rail issues kept firm. Foreign Government bonds recovered slightly from the shake- out earlier in the week. Turnover in domestic bonds totalled $6,010,000. Moody's commodity index (31st December, 1931:100) was 172.5, against 172.8 on Friday. As regards the Stock Market outlook, temporary setbacks would not be surpris ing, but no important liquidation is con sidered likely in view of the bullish nature of business reports from all parts of the country. The market is also watching developments at Washington, and although the path of arms embargo repeal will not be smooth, Wall Street believes that President Roosevelt will be successful if the Bill, which should be ready for Congressional consideration early this week, clearly defines the policy of neutrality. The \" New York Times\" business activity index for the week to 16th September is 99.8, compared with 97.2 for the previous week and 85.9 a year ago. Motor-car production last week is esti mated by Ward's at 53,950 units, against 41.245 in the previous week. Industrial Rayon dividend 25c (previous payment 25c January, 1938). Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad net in- come for August $4,081,000 ($2,809,000 year ago). Erie net income for August $820,000 ($440,000).

   "text_content" : "Some members of the American market were flattering themselves on Friday with the delusion that the passing of summer-time in the United States during the week-end would mean that Wall Street opening prices would come in an hour earlier. Actually the New York markets will open to-day at 4 p.m. London time and close at 9 o'clock. Consequently prices will now come in an hour later than usual until the postponed end of B.S.T. on the morning of 19th November. Time and Wall Street Without wishing to follow Messrs. Priestley and Dunne into the mys- teries of the fourth dimension it is clear that divergencies of time are about to divorce the New York and London markets in Yankee stocks. Since the London Stock Exchange has been closing at 2 p.m. few jobbers or arbitrageurs have found it worth while to wait in the Street until some tithe after three o'clock in the hope of doing business on the basis of the opening Wall Street prices. Allowing for current cable delays, prices this afternoon are not likely to come in much earlier than 4.30. Therefore, as the nights draw in, domestic dealings in Yankees will be more and more limited to the hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with prices based only approximately on the over- night New York parities. Sporting Risks In the Yankee market there has always been a large number of sport- ing dealers willing to take commercial risks. I suppose they have done as much business since the outbreak of the war as any of their confreres else- where in the House, and more than most. Stocks once shipped to the United States cannot now be bought back, so that many experts anticipate that before very long favourite American issues will command a premium in London over the equivalents of the contemporaneous New York quota- tions. It is not likely that the Treasury will requisition British holdings of Ameri- can or Canadian stocks for a very long time to come. On the other hand, in- vestors should not forget that they will have to hand over any dollar dividends to the Bank of England to be con- verted into sterling at the official buying rates-at present 4.04 for United States and 4.47 for Canadian dollars. . -.... War Wastage \" War,\" as we all know and as is em- phasised by a brokers' current market note, \"means the wastage of vast quantities of raw material.\" Much which in peace-time may be used over and over again is for ever destroyed. In this connection my broker friends draw special attention to copper and steel. In these two categories they suggest Rhodesian Selection Trust at 16s 3d and Vickers at 15s. The Trust owns 64 per cent. of the capital in the Mufulira Copper Mine, which is one of the largest and nearly the cheapest, copper pro- ducers in the world. Costs at the Mufulira Mine work out at Â£26 a ton of copper, the output last year was 52,436 tons, the present production 6,000 tons a month, and the capacity 8,000 tons. Vickers, through its subsidiary com- panies, is, of course, one of the greatest steel and armament manufacturers in the world. The group should have learnt a great deal from its not alto- gether fortunate experiences after the last war. \"Fractions Drive Me Mad\" A misguided bank clerk makes the callous suggestion that if it is all the same to Sir John Simon an increase of income-tax to 6s 8d in the Â£ would be more convenient than the recently mooted idea of 6s 6d. The latter would constitute as awkward a frac- tion for grossing-up tax-free dividends as 5s 6d has been. This official deals exclusively with coupons and dividends. To be able to calculate tax at exactly one-third of a pound would, he remarks, \"prac- tically halve my coupon work.\" How- ever, the man who pays the tax would doubtless much prefer to save the twopence and let the fractions look after themselves. hbe Btartst",

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange adjustment to war conditions is making steady progress. Business has remained difficult during the past week, but there has been a significant change of atmosphere and jobbers in some markets are already showing greater readiness to quote dealing prices. The change of sentiment can be traced to encouraging developments both inside and outside the House. Markets started the week badly, with war news unfavourable and selling in advance of the Settlement far from completed. These factors were re- flected only too plainly on prices, which gave .way heavily in most markets. A combination of favourable circum- stances has since altered the course of values and has given markets a more cheerful appearance. Selling in advance of the Settlement was soon completed, and Account Day passed without any untoward event. Several leading industrial com- panies, including Imperial Chemical, Spillers and British Aluminium, main- tained their interim dividends, thereby encouraging the hope that directorial anxiety to conserve resources is not in danger of being carried to inordinate lengths. LIGHT ON TAXATION Another favourable influence was the announcement that Sir John Simon's War Budget is to be introduced next Wednes- day. Dealers took heart from the know- ledge that tax uncertainties are to be dis- pelled, and that light will be thrown on the financial policy of the Government in the course of a few days. It is true that the varied burdens which industry will be called upon to shoulder remain unknown; but uncertainty of any kind is invariably inimical to Stock Ex- change confidence, and there is no doubt that fear of the unknown in the realm of taxation has been a serious brake on activity during the past month. The mere prospect of relief from past doubts thus made some contribution to the better tone of markets. Recovery in Industrial shares, pre- viously one of the most depressed markets, has provided the week's most striking movement. Demand has been selective and some recently active sections such as Ship- ping shares have gone out of favour. On the other hand, bargain hunters have shown greater activity in Brewery, Tobacco and Iron and Steel shares, and although many prices show declines on the week the recovery from the lowest has been substantial. Many leading Industrials had been feel- ing the full impact of necessitous selling resulting from the impending Settlement and the freezing-up of the gilt-edged market. The rebound when such selling ceased -was - all the--g eater--and--was assisted by the measures taken during the week to lighten the burdens on industry imposed by the Government scheme for the compulsory insurance of trading stocks. RAILWAY COMPENSATION Another market to reveal a sharp re- versal of price trend has been that for Home Railway stocks. Declines at the beginning of the week have since been replaced by satisfactory gains, induced partly by the general improvement in sentiment, and also by the expectation that the terms of Government compensation to the companies for war-time control will he announced almost immediately. In view of the great increase in railway activity inseparable from war conditions, payment by the Government for the use of the lines should be generous, but doubt as to the actual form of the compensa- tion has so far restricted interest in the Railway stocks. Largely as a result of anticipations that uncertainty will soon be set at rest, buying of the Ordinary stocks has raised quota- tions to figures well above their worst, while the unofficial minimum prices for the rior cnarges nave once more become the asis of an effective market in which securities can be sold as well as bought. Fixed minimum prices in the gilt-edged market have operated less satisfactorily. British Government stocks, indeed, have become still more difficult to sell, and the market had for all practical purposes dried up even before the announcement that Bank Rate was being retained at 4 per cent. GILT-EDGED \"SWAPS\" The week's activity in gilt-edged stocks has consisted mainly of \"swaps\" from long-dated and irredeemable securities into Conversion Four and a-Half per Cent. Loan, due for final redemption in 1944 and therefore a short-dated stock. Dealers have been prepared by buy War Loan and other long-dated issues at the minimum price on condition that the seller buys Conversion Four and a-Half per Cents. at a figure considerably above the minimum for that stock. Since the latter is still marketable, the effect of such exchanges is to provide holders with a realisable stock in place of an unmarketable long- dated issue, but only at the cost of some points in the price at which the short- dated security is acquired. Among commodity shares, Oils have attracted most interest, finishing the week with increased activity and a fresh rise in prices. With petroleum products as necessary to success in war as they are to progress in peace-time, the demand for Oil shares is not difficult to justify. Buying has recently been concentrated on Trinidad shares and on promising com- panies whose South American properties are far removed from the hazards of war. As far as the major companies are con- cerned, war risks may seem greater, but are diminished by the spread of such com- panies' interests over wide areas and the almost impregnable position in which their finances have been placed. As was inevitable, war has been a severely depressing influence on the foreign bond market, where European bonds had previously been popular as high- yielding investments. Under current con- ditions, demand for holdings of this type has been completely lacking, with the result that many widely held securities have already been marked down practically to rubbish levels. With the market so far out of favour, even South Americans have lacked support, although some of the lower priced of these issues may offer scope for bargain-hunting at some time in the future. MINES IN THE DOLDRUMS Although many Mining shares joined in the general recovery towards the close of the week, mining markets as a whole have been singularly uninteresting. Gold shares were bought prior to the war as a hedge against depreciation of sterling. Such protection has been rendered illusory by measures adopted in most British dominions to prevent the mines from deriving anything like the full benefit from the rise in the price of gold, and the market is still influenced by resulting disappoint- ment. Interest in Base-metal descriptions has been limited by the absence of Metal Exchange dealings, the existence of maximum prices, and other war-time restrictions. There has therefore been a tendency on the part of Mining investors as a whole to await further indications of working results under newly created con- ditions before undertaking new commit- ments. This attitude, with the absence of free overseas communication, provides sufficient reason for mining market inactivity. Despite the continued inflexibility of markets generally the events of the past week have shown that the Stock Exchange is steadily adapting itself to war-time operations. The Budget on Wednesday should clear the ground for further pro- gress, but Sir John Simon's statement must still leave so many imponderables in the situation that hope of a rapid return to I normal dealings would .

I understand on the highest authority that the exchange control actually gained gold in the current week. It is believed that in order to avoid declaring foreign holdings, citizens and corporations are preferring to repatriate their capital. Therefore there is a chance that the con- tinued inflow may compensate the outflow necessitated by national defence pur- chases abroad. The total addition to the gold reserve in the past ten months now figures at Frs.26 milliards (Â£147,300,000). Accom- panying the inflow of capital is a steady reflux of deposits into banks and the can- cellation of credits extended by the Bank of France. Current subscriptions to the Treasury issues are also good.",

   "text_content" : "Interest in the Prime Minister's review of the situation, to be made in the House of Commons to-morrow, is overshadowed, so far as the City is concerned, by Wednesday's forth- coming statement on the Budget by Sir John Simon. It is not too much to say that Stock Exchange business during the past week or ten days has been held back by, more than anything else, the shadow of the impending Budget, as to whose provisions there are guesses enough to fill the whole of this column. Budget Suspense Prospective buyers have been post- poning purchases which they would like to make by reason of the uncer- tainty that shrouds the Budget possi- bilities. When these are known, how- ever onerous they may be, it will be- come easier to assess the likely effect upon various industries. The one thing which militates above all against Stock Exchange business is suspense. With that ended by the speech of the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, a greater amount of freedom will be possible, and this should have its effect upon business all round. Four Per Cent.? Sir John Simon is expected to an- nounce the steps he will take in respect of raising a national loan. Nobody knows anything, of course, but if the Chancellor should declare the Govern- ment's intention to pay no more than 4 per cent., then War Loan, Conversion Three and a-Half per Cents., and other British Government stocks on the 4 per cent. yield-line should become readily marketable once more. The Government's Interest The Government's interest obviously is to have the Consol market in as liquid a condition as possible. The best con- tribution to this end would be receipt of good news from one or other of the war fronts. The ease with which prices in the Consol market rose above the minimum scale soon after this was fixed showed how rapidly such minimum prices can be left behind upon the least breath of public demand. Should the week-end news provide grounds for satisfaction it will create a better im- pression than anything which Sir John Simon may be going to say next Wednesday. Stock Exchange Half-year The Stock Exchange starts to-day upon the second half of its financial year. The interim dividend statement is due on Wednesday in next week. This time last year the interim dividend was Â£5 per share. The price then stood at a little over 200. To-day, it is about Â£100, Nominations being quoted nomi- nally at the same price. It seems hard, by the way, that mem- bers who, either from being called up or from seeing their business tem- porarily destroyed, are obliged to give up the House, should have to sell their Nominations within a year. If the Rule could be suspended \" for duration,\" this would be not only a valuable but also a reasonable concession. Autalyru1",

   "text_content" : "Minimum prices for gilt-edged stocks, fixed just over a month ago, undoubtedly solved an immediate market problem, but they are now raising others almost as pressing. The fixed prices came into force before the rise in Bank Rate to 4 per cent. had exercised its effect on investment, and at a time when the issues of peace or war were still in the balance. A corollary to the higher level of money rates was a rise in yields on gilt-edged stocks, while the actual onset of war increased the urgency of defence bor- rowing and made a higher level of taxation a practical certainty of the immediate future. All the underlying influences on gilt-edged stocks during the past month have thus been ad- verse, and although for a short time dealing quotations rose above the minima, these levels have since been out of touch with everyday reality. Having been fixed too high to meet changed yield requirements, they have failed to attract buyers. Since jobbers have been unable to sell, they in their turn have in the end refused to take stock, with the result that the market has dried up for all practical purposes. The importance of the gilt-edged market has been underlined by the position arising from its failure to function. Investors have been incon- venienced by the absence of a ready market for holdings of British Govern- ment securities, and the lack of facili- ties for turning investments into cash has doubtless hampered some indus- trial enterprises. Another unfavour- able, though sometimes exaggerated, result of the gilt-edged jam has been evident in Industrial and other sec- tions of the Stock Exchange, where recent realisations have been due in part to the fact that British Funds have lost their market. Any attempt to break the deadlock by merely re- ducing or abolishing the minimum price system is for the moment out of the question. Complete withdrawal of the fixed quotations might bring down prices alarmingly, and reduc- tion in the minima, without any simul- taneous adjustments of other gilt- edged market factors, would have to be on a drastic scale before it could have any chance of restoring an effec- tive market. Unless accompanied by measures to consolidate the position, such as a reduction in Bank Rate, either ex- pedient would produce deplorable results. Many existing loans would become inadequately secured, and in- stitutional investors would be em- barrassed by a drop in the market value of their investments. Moreover, a fall in the gilt-edged market would undermine confidence and react on any chance of war borrowing on reasonable terms. Fictitious as the present position may be, it is obviously desirable that it should be maintained until a new basis for the appraisement of gilt-edged stocks is provided by a wider knowledge of the Government's intentions. Sir John Simon is to intro- duce his Emergency Budget on Wed- nesday and is expected to deal with war finance problems, with which the difficulties of the gilt-edged market are closely connected. Changes in the minimum price scheme, with or with- out a cut in Bank Rate, may be neces- sary, but the first requirement of any logical adjustment must be a know- ledge of the financial and monetary plans of the Treasury.",

   "text_content" : "The reasonably confident attitude adopted by the Chairman of the Rover Company at the meeting last year was well justified, for the advance state- ment of results for the twelve months ended 5th August shows a substantial improvement in profits. The net amount has risen from Â£168,900 to Â£206,000. In considering this result it is important to note that, except for a small amount received as fee for operating a shadow factory, the whole of the profit has been made entirely from normal activities in the motor- car business. Under current conditions the out- look for the business is obscure, but shareholders have the satisfaction of knowing that the improved results for the past year justify the 15 per cent. dividend being supplemented by a cash bonus of 2J per cent. The shares of the nominal value of 8s each are quoted at 11s 3d cum and at that figure yield over 13 per cent. The dividend is conservative, since after reserving Â£70,000 for taxation nearly Â£57,000 of the profit is retained, Â£50,000 being specifically set aside as a war con- tingency reserve.",

   "text_content" : "In a reduction of income and depre- ciation of investments the City and International Trust conforms to the general experience of trust under- takings during the past year. Valua- tion of the holdings at 31st August shows a drop of 36.6 per cent., against 29.3 per cent., after allowing in each case for reserve and carry-forward. The feature of the investment list is the relatively large proportion of holdings in Europe and South America, amount- ing together to 43.6 per cent. of the total. The possibility of increased trade for the South American countries under war conditions, and a consequent improvement in the exchanges, gives these otherwise depressed holdings a speculative prospect which may operate favourably for the Trust in future. In- vestments in Great Britain and the Empire amount to 48.7 per cent. of the total, against 47.6 per cent. Considering market conditions during the year, the decline of Â£7,400 to Â£88,800 in gross income is not unduly heavy. The difference in net profit was further lessened by a saving of Â£1,000 in ex- penses and interest.' While the Ordi- nary dividend is reduced to 3 per cent., against 4 per cent. in each of the two preceding years, it is well covered by earnings, and the fact that Â£4,000 less is required for the distribution allows an increase of Â£3,000 to Â£39,400 in the carry-forward.",

The increased demand which resulted in an advance of Â£16,900 to Â£264,900 in net profit last year may be attributed to the nervous strain of re- current crises rather than to any epi- demic such as the influenza which accounted for the unusually large earn- ings in 1937. The dividend of 25 per cent., now paid for the fourth successive year, is covered by earnings of about 41 per cent., against 39 per cent. It is thus possible to repeat the transfer of Â£50,000 to general reserve, making Â£200,000, while Â£10,000 (against nil) to dividend equalisation reserve brings the total to Â£30,000. Together with Â£25,000 of share premiums the company now has aggregate reserves of Â£255,000. A decline of a few hundreds in the carry-forward at Â£11.200 is explained by the extra charge for taxation,,which absorbs Â£95,000, against Â£85,000. The balance-sheet position has been con- siderably strengthened, the outstanding change being an increase of Â£136,500 to Â£351,900 in cash. Debtors are reduced by Â£48,700 to Â£96,000, but stocks are rather larger. The strong liquid situa- tion puts the company in good shape to weather any ordinary storm, although the outlook is not necessarily adverse for this type of business.",

   "text_content" : "A proposal for reorganising the capital structure of Clayton Dewandre Company seems to imply that it may become desirable in the near future for the company to raise additional capital. Such an operation, like that now put forward, will need Treasury sanction, but in the meantime the approval of the stock- holders is to be sought for enlarging the authorised capital and merging Ordinary and Deferred into one class. That is not quite so simple as it sounds, for the Deferred, in amount only one-third of the Ordinary, takes one-half the divisible profits after each class has received 8 per cent. The rate of dividend on the Deferred will therefore be correspondingly higher in good times. In compensa- tion for loss of the right to such advantage it is intended to give the Deferred holders a 20 per cent. bonus out of reserves on conversion of their stock into Ordinary. On the whole the directors' plan seems to deserve their description of it as fair and reasonable. The present Deferred holders would be slightly better off under the new plan if profits were sufficient to pay 8Ã½ per cent. under existing arrangements on the Ordinary. If that rate could be raised to 9 per cent. the reverse would be the case. Owners of the Deferred, by accepting the scheme, will therefore do a little better in times of moderate activity at the expense of some sacri- fice in more prosperous times, when the present Ordinary holders would be recompensed for abandoning their prior right.",

(Strand) debenture stock from 1st October (the due date of the next payment). It is obvious that the undertaking, whose earnings last year were the lowest since 1932, must have been seriously hit by the departure of overseas guests and by the curtailment of festivities in present conditions. The company is asking to be relieved of cash payments on the debenture stock in question until the war has ended and the company has completed one financial year subsequently. The step is a drastic one, but it would certainly not have been proposed if the directors could have seen any way of avoiding it. Subject to anything that transpires at the meeting, holders would seem to have no choice but to accept. They are offered Deferred Income cer- tificates in respect of the accruing in- terest, the certificates to bear interest at 6 per cent. and to be redeemable out of profits after the suspension period before resumption of any dividends.

   "text_content" : "The reawakening of interest in Home Railway junior stocks at the close of last week was a distinct con- trast with the stagnation which had reigned in that market since Govern- ment assumed control of the lines. Demand for certain of the stocks was stimulated by talk of the possibility of an early announcement of the Govern- ment's plans for compensating the companies for use of their essential transport services during the period of the war. The basis of the scheme is no doubt already decided upon, but it is possible that final details will not be arranged until the Tribunal's award in regard to the wages claims of the three railwaymen's unions has been announced. This is not expected immediately, although it is probable that it will be expedited in view of the present exceptional circumstances. In the meantime, the absence of any indication as to the way in which the railways will be reimbursed for the services they are providing on the home front prevents any useful esti- mate being formed of prospects. The unofficial minimum prices fixed for prior charge stocks are maintained and the brake on free dealings there- fore continues. An early announce- ment of the Government's intentions is clearly desirable. The market is toying with the idea that compensa- tion may be based on the average net revenues for the past three years, of which 1936 and 1937 were in a relative sense fairly good and 1938 distinctly poor. In the first eight months of the current year the tide was turning strongly in favour of the companies and although this was due to a material extent to rearmament it will doubtless not be disregarded in the formulation of; the.

Should the Custodian decide to sell any stocks or shares vested in him, these, with the consent of the Board of Trade, can be acquired by the respective companies con- cerned and reissued if desired.

Congratulations are due to those chairmen who did not allow them- selves to be stampeded into abandon- ing normal arrangements. They have thus afforded a useful lead to the rest of the City in keeping business going. First in the field was Sir William Firth at the meeting of Richard Thomas and Co Meeting only a few days after war had been declared, he was met with the friendliest of re- sponses from his shareholders. Even Mr. Barnabas Russell, an inveterate critic of the old days, agreed to sus- pend hostilities for the period of the war-although reserving full rights to return to the attack when peace is here. Copper Connections TO Sir Albert Bennett, who has just been elected chairman of Ransome and Marles Bearing, the operations of the Ministry of Information are of par- ticular interest. Sir Albert was in the Ministry of Information during the last war, his task being the control of propaganda in South and Central America. He had a long business career in South America and still owns property in the Argentine. Earlier this year Sir Albert became chairman of the Anglo Metal Company. He thereby added to his close connec- tions with the copper industry for he is a director of Roan Antelope, Rhodesian Selection Trust, Mufulira and Trepca Mines. Cotton Policy SHE Cotton Board appointed by the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Supply has been quick in coming into action. It held its first meeting in Manchester last week on the day after its membership had been announced. Sir Percy Ashley, the chairman of the Board, was secretary of the Im- port Duties Advisory Committee for seven years. He relinquished the post in May to become a member of the Committee. He has set up four committees of the new Board. They will deal re- spectively with cotton production generally and Government supplies, with raw cotton supplies, the export trade, and with the demands of the cotton industry for other commodities. One of Sir Percy's main tasks is to see that export trade is not sacrificed unduly in meeting home requirements. Ex-Governor. ONE of the many directorial changes necessitated by the recent death of Mr. John Agnew has been the election of Sir Cecil Rodwell to the Board of Taquah and Abosso Mines. He was already a director of the parent com- pany, Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa. Sir Cecil has long connections with South Africa. They date from the South African War, in which he served in the Suffolk Yeomanry. Subsequently he was attached to the staff of Lord Milner, who was then Governor of the Transvaal and the then Orange River Colony. Higher honours followed, for Sir Cecil became successively Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, Governor of British Guiana and Governor of Southern Rhodesia. He held the last appointment until 1935, when he was succeeded by Sir Herbert Stanley. Canada's Mr. Norman SIS appointment to head the Dominion's Foreign Exchange Con- trol Board has strengthened Mr. Graham Towers's claim to be called the Montagu Norman of Canada. When the Bank of Canada opened its doors five years ago Mr. Towers became its first Governor and, at 37, the youngest of the Central Bank dictators. His youthful appearance has given Mr. Towers some amusing experiences. A dinner neighbour quite recently asked him his profession. \"I'm in banking,\" Mr. Towers replied. \"That's too bad,\" said his neighbour, \"there's no future for anyone in banking.\" Liverpudlian CIR JOHN HUGO RUTHERFORD, who has joined the Board of the Liverpool brewery Peter Walker (Warrington) and Robert Cain and Sons, is a well-known Liverpudlian. He is a son of the late Sir Watson Rutherford, a Lord Mayor of the city. The Edge Hill Division of Liverpool, which Sir John represented in Parlia- ment for four years to 1935, is prac- tically identical with the old West Derby Division for which his father sat for twenty years. Sir John is a solicitor, being a member of the family firm of Ruther- fords. He was a Captain in the Liver- pool Regiment in the last war. Sir Percy Simmons SIR PERCY SIMMONS had many claims to fame. In the City he stood in the forefront of the half-dozen or so solicitors who hold unchallenged position as leaders in the realm of company affairs. At County Hall he did yeoman service on behalf of London and did much to break down old antagonisms between Guildhall and its newer rival across the river. Above all he was a popular figure among a host of friends. His untimely death robs the world of finance in par- ticular of one of its most able and best-liked members. Observer z .i;Y"

   "text_content" : "Correspondence reaching THE FINANCIAL TIMES makes it clear that misunderstanding still exists regarding the obligations placed upon banks to receive gold coin and bullion. To assist in the payment of purchases abroad, the Government has decreed that all private holdings of gold coin or bullion must be offered to it through a bank. The Government has undertaken to make payment in sterling at the pre- vailing rate. The banks, it is stipulated, are to help tenderers to make a statement of the amount of their holdings and are to make payment in cash as soon as the transfer to the Government has been completed. The obligation to sell to the Government ex- tends to everyone resident in the United Kingdom. RECEPTION OBLIGATORY Gold to be offered for sale includes, besides gold bullion in the form of bars and ingots, any kind of gold coin, British or foreign, except genuine collectors' pieces. The offer of rings, plate or other articles of gold is not called for at present. Anyone receiving gold from any source is required to deliver it immediately to the Government through his ordinary banker. It will be seen that there is not only an obligation on everyone to deliver up their gold coin and bullion, but that it is equally obligatory for bankers to receive these offerings. When this gold is received by banks it must be passed immediately to the autho- rised dealers, of whom there are six, all in the City. They are: Johnson Matthey and Co., Pixley and Abell, Mocatta and Goldsmid, Samuel Montagu and Co., N. M. Rothschild and Sons and Sharps and Wilkins. Many holders of gold coin report that they have experienced difficulty in effect- ing disposal at the local branch of their bank. This difficulty should disappear as the import of the regulations becomes more widely known. Bullion brokers have been giving 39s 3d per full-weight sovereign, less %a per Â£100 commission, with a minimum charge of Is per parcel."

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT DUNDEE Saturday. Business in the jute industry is still practically suspended and the issue of fresh controlled maximum prices is anxiously awaited. There is an existing order of maximum rates dated 1st Septem- ber, but those set down for yarns are considered to be far too low in view of the big advance which has taken place in raw jute in Calcutta since that date, amounting to at least Â£10 per ton. Values of Calcutta goods also have ad- vanced, recovering on the placing of orders in Calcutta by the Indian Govern- ment, on behalf of the British Govern- ment, for 152,000,000 sand-bags to be delivered by the end of January next. Previous weakness had resulted from the declaration by the Indian Government that no raw jute or goods could be ex- ported, except by special license, to countries other than Great Britain and her colonies, France and her colonies, United States, Portugal and Egypt. The Indian jute mills evidently expect a big increase in demand, as they have decided to increase the working hours from 45 to 54 per week. Dundee spinners and manufacturers are extremely busy on contracts in hand, but new business is idle at the moment."

C., Hall Green-In view of existing con- ditions we think all speculative transac- tions of the kind sugg, sted should be avoided. Ariston-1. The Rover re, -t is due next month. 2. Hold Venterspost. The treat- ment plant should start up any time now. 3. Marlu look reasonably hopeful at their current reduced price. 4. Postpone a pur- chase.. You could get a better yield just now from a first-class Kaffir share. Aylesbury-1. The position is that 13s 4d can be called at any time and the balance only in case of liquidation. 2. There is prac- tically no market in these, and it is useless to attempt to sell now. Belle-Conditions for the acquisition of the shares should it be decided on have not been announced, and you can only await developments. E. K.-1-3. Yes, the Randfonteins December dividend should be at least 2s 3d. The report for the current year is due next spring. It is considered that the high yield obtainable from these shares offsets a cer- tain doubt as to the development outlook for the mine. 4. We should think that the chances are that the interest rates will be maintained. E. S.-Libanon recently raised enough money to complete shaft-sinking and carry on the extensive development. Probably more capital will be required in a year or two to erect a large-scale treatment plant. There is no hurry to buy the shares. Grosvenor-In our opinion London Transport \"C\" should be held. The final dividend for 1938-39 is due next month. Heath-Hold all seven, for the present at any rate. There is no prospect of dividends from Nos. 5 or 6 for a very long time to come, but all the same they have lock-up chances. H. M. S.-Tin share prospects appear favourable. At all events we would not sell just now any of those you hold. N. P. G. M.--It is impossible to say. Shares from which no early dividend can be ex- pected, and which, therefore, do not pay for their keep, are of necessity liable to violent fluctuations according to the mood of the market. Pat-We cannot say why the shares have not moved with others of a similar character. We consider them a good holding and would not sell now. R. E. G. M.-The position is as stated and for the present the money must be left where it is. You must leave it to the trus- tees to invest the money for you in local securities. Dividends can be remitted, but, of course, only at the current rate of ex- change. Roger-We know of nothing other than the general state of markets to account for the declines. Both are worth holding for recovery later on. T. F.-Austin Motor accounts are made up to 31st July and submitted in October. Nundy- droog Mines were marked on 18th Septem- ber ex an interim 2s.",

   "text_content" : "Considerable quantities of wool, includ- ing East Indian, etc., and of cross bred tops are required in the execution of Government contracts about to be placed. The prices for these wools, states the Wool Control, will be the existing maxi- mum prices subject to such additions, if any, as may be made to the maximum prices when wool and tops generally are taken over by the Wool Control. The Control invites offers, together with samples and statement of the delivery which can be given of tops of 50s to 56s qualities which are available for immedi- ate delivery and for delivery within one month. These offers and samples should be addressed to the chief top appraiser, Wool Control, Cumberland Works, Brad- ford. This announcement should remove feel- ings of uncertainty lately prevailing in some sections of the trade and do much to facilitate a more free flow of business. It is well known that, since the introduc- tion of specified maximum prices, certain holders of free stocks of wool and/or tops have been reluctant to sell in case a sub- sequent revision of the schedule estab- lished higher prices. It is clear from the foregoing announce- ment, however, that no useful purpose can now be served by refraining from selling or otherwise holding back supplies of wool or tops required for Government pur- poses, as firms are assured that they do not stand to lose if any subsequent addi- tion is made to existing maximum prices.",

   "text_content" : "Criticism of some of the blacK-out conditions in financial spheres is in- creasing. The hope is being expressed on all sides that changes will be wrought shortly. The question most interesting the City is that of Bank Rate, although it is thought that this may be solved after the presentation of the first War Budget on Wednesday. Indeed, sur- prise will be felt if this Budget is not accompanied by a statement on general financial policy. Most City observers are con- vinced that the burden of financing the war should be met mainly by taxa- tion, the view being that as a heavy increase is inevitable it should be brought into force as soon as possible so that we may know where we stand. Postal Orders There is also a growing feeling that the emergency order by which postal orders were made legal tender should be rescinded. It is pointed out that not only are such orders passing in the form of currency notes and, there- fore, giving a false idea of the actual note circulation, but the Government is losing revenue, owing to the aboli- tion of poundage, which it can ill afford. It is understood that there is a possibility of action being taken in the matter shortly. Owing to the whole- sale evacuations and the extensive mobilisation, some quarters of the country have, apparently, suffered from a shortage of silver. Immediately this position has been remedied and the authorities have a clearer idea as to note requirements, a change may well take place and the legal tender \" virtue \"of postal orders be removed. City observers, too, resent the absence of publication of the monthly average weekly statements of the clearing banks. It is admitted that the removal of parts of the clearing to the provinces has caused some dis- turbance and delay, but this is not regarded as a reason for not issuing these statements. Banks and Bills The question of a coming cut in Bank Rate was being eagerly canvassed in Lombard-street before the week-end. As far as can be ascertained, no indication has been given by the authorities that it is intended to accelerate the recent decline in bill rates, so that the low level of the average tender rate on Friday was due to the popular maturity of the paper offering. The tender, incidentally, was in- teresting because of the respectable percentage quota obtained by the market syndicate. As reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES more than a week ago, the syndicate now submits larger appli- cations. It is believed, in fact, that the three big companies have doubled their tenders and other syndicate members have added 15 per cent. to their pre- vious applications. This means, there- fore, that the syndicate probably goes for Â£45-Â£50,000,000 of bills each week, irrespective of the amount available. This means that for the past three weeks the market has secured sub- santis -b_--.-_ UI U. 1 ll t- ... . . . . 9 q q 1 1 ats ntial amounts of a Lne Lenders. Notwitnstanaing hins, it has not been turning over these bills to the extent that it might. Actually, the leading firms are believed to have been much more generous in their response to bank demands than the companies, but as it is the last- named who acquire the bulk of the paper the banks find themselves rather starved of bills. So acute has the position become that certain banks have threatened that, unless it is changed quickly, they will have to consider the question of submitting tenders themselves-that it. on their own behalf each week. Thus the gentleman's agreement would go and a rate cutting war would begin. The market holds on to the bills, of course, in the hope of making a still larger margin of profit should Bank Rate be reduced, but there is such a thing as being too greedy. Indian Trade There was again little change in the total turnover of Indian seaborne trade during August as compared with the preceding month, but alterations took place in the constituent totals. Thus, while imports showed a small increase of Rs.19 lakhs to Rs.1,388 lakhs, exports suffered a slight set- back of Rs.32 lakhs to Rs.1,638 lakhs. It should be pointed out that the July export figures were the best for any month since September, 1937, and that, in recent years, there has been a tendency for seaborne trade to con- tract rather sharply in August. It is also interesting to record that imports in August, 1938, were easily the lowest for nineteen months. Since then they have been persistently larger than for the corresponding months of the pre- vious year. Despite the divergent movements in August, the favourable balance of trade in merchandise alone remained at the satisfactory figure of Rs.250 lakhs. Net private gold exports were appre- ciably smaller than in July, but the international situation doubtless ac- counted in part for that.

Net remittances of Govern- ment funds by India during August increased substantially from a mere Rs.2 lakhs to Rs.765 lakhs, making the aggregate to date Rs.1260 lakhs, as compared with only Rs.187 lakhs for Anril-Auirrist. 1938.

   "text_content" : "Provincial Stock Markets suffered from profit-taking last week, but ended on a firmer note. Textiles, Shippings and Coal, Iron and Steel shares have received some support at the lower levels. On the Manchester Stock Exchange, Textiles, especially Preferences, have been bought at the reduced prices. Bradford Dyers Ordinary have fallen Is to 4s 6d on the week, but the Preference have rallied to 7s 3d from 6s 9d. Bleachers Ordinary have eased from 3s 3d to 2s 9d, with the Preference virtually unchanged around 6s. Calico Printers Ordinary and Preference are a few pence down at 4s 9d and 6s 6d respectively, and Fine Spinners Ordinary have declined to 3s 9d, but the Preference have been well maintained at 8s 9d. A. and S. Henry have strengthened to 7s 9d on the company's improving prospects, and Kelsall and Kemp have been in request at 17s 3d. BIRMINGHAM SELLS MOTORS At Birmingham the general fall in In- dustrials appears to be now checked. There is still little doing in Steels, but prices are inclined to pick up; Stewarts and Lloyds finished the week firm at 37s 9d, and Tube Investments are 73s 9d, after being 72s 6d. Small Arms have steadily fallen to 22s 7%d, J. Lucas are depressed around 52s 6d, and Radiation are dull at. about 28s. Rippingilles (5s 3d) and Valor (19s 6d) are very firm. Motors have been a poor market, except Standards, which have fallen from 10s to 9s. Morris are materially lower at 24s, Austin \"A\" at 16s and S.S. Cars at 5s. Rovers have fallen to 10s 7%d, but Alvis keep firm at 2s 3d, Singers at Is 7Yd and Guys at 2s 1~d. Raleigh Cycles have reacted to 44s 6d and New Hudsons to 39s 6d. FALL AT LIVERPOOL After a depressing start at Liverpool, the week ended with a slightly improved tone. Business in Insurance shares is still a matter of negotiation, and some severe price falls have occurred, though closing values are above the lowest. Taxation fears have depressed Breweries. Interest in Shippings has flagged, but prices at the slightly reduced levels show resistance. Business at Glasgow has been quiet, and although the week ended generally firm earlier declines in local shares have been only partially made up. In Iron and Steels (despite the evidence of even greater trade activity), Babcocks at 42s, John Brown 24s and Bairds and Scottish Steel 21s are all 2s to 3s down, while Stewarts and Lloyds (in face of the merger approval) are 3s 3d lower at 38s. Colvilles have declined to 19s, Wm. Beardmore to 19s and Rivet Bolt to 27s. MORE BUSINESS AT BRISTOL There has been a slight increase in turn- over at Bristol, and prices have stiffened. Tobaccos have been fairly busy, and a fall in Imperials to 97s 6d brought in support with a rally to 106s 3d. Stothert and Pitt's excellent results caused some inquiry for the shares round the higher level of 32s, and Newman Industries have been bought at 3s 6d. Bristol Trams have dropped to 37s 6d. Although a rather steadier tone de- veloped at Cardiff towards the close, the week's price changes are usually adverse to holders. Apart from Stothert and Pitt, which jumped 2s to 82s on the good results, Coals and Lowa are lower. Markets at Edinburgh have shown an improving tendency towards the end of the week. Scottish Banks are on offer. Among Investment Trusts, British Assets are firm around 10s, but Scottish Ameri- can are lower at 27s and the \" B \" offered at 31s. Industrials are generally steady; Patons and Baldwins Ordinary 48s 10%d, Scottish Drapery Pref. 26s, North British Rubber 4s, Morrison and Gibb Ordinary 38s 3d, Shotts Iron done at 16s and Burnt- island Shipbuilding 25s. NEWCASTLE STEADIER Few dealings have been recorded at Newcastle, business still being a matter of negotiation, but markets by mid-week turned steadier and maintained the im- provement to the close. Coal, Steel and Irons are quiet, but steady; Consett Irons at 6s 9d are 6d up, Pease and Partners are higher at 10s lYd, Richardsons Wpst- garth Ordinary have been done at 4s, Stephenson and Hawthorns are 2s 11i, and Vickers finished easier at 14s Ot after being 15s 4%d. In Shippings, Cairn Line Ordinary have recorded 5s 9d and Moor Lines have been inquired for at 11s with no sellers. SHEFFIELD DULL Quietude has ruled at Sheffield in Coal, Iron and Steel shares. Vickers closed 2s 3d down on the week at 14s 6d, John Browns are steady around 24s, United Steels have rallied on the dividend to 21s, Stantons have fallen 3s to 47s, and Thos. W. Ward are Is down at 21s. Collieries have been mostly weak, although Midland pits are less affected than those of other areas by the disturbance of export trade, while collieries with coking interests are coming into their own again. Bolsovers have lost 3s at 41s, Staveley Is to 38s, but Sheepbridge have held up around 40s 6d and the new (10s paid) have been done at 16s 1%d. General Refractories are de- riving benefit from pronounced steel activity, but the shares have eased to 7s 6d. Batchelor's Peas have declined is to 12s. BELFAST BUYS RAILS Belfast markets have been quiet. Ulster 3% per cent. 1943 has been done at 97%, and the 41 per cent. loan is offered at 101.

   "text_content" : "Attention is being directed by the Stock Exchange to the prospects of companies engaged in the export trade. It is realised that at present the conflicting demands of armaments and of export trade present some difficulties. This is receiving the active attention of the Government. As already reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES, industry has of its own initiative drawn up plans to ensure that export inquiries are pooled among undertakings best. able to carry them out. There remains the need for clearer definition on the part of the Government of what has been called its commercial foreign policy. This is shown by the numerous inquiries already received in Whitehall on this subject from representative industrialists. To these inquirers emphasis has been laid upon the importance of maintain- ing export trade, and these traders have been asked to carry on to the best of their ability. At the same time some industrialists have experienced an, apparent lack of co-ordination among! the various Government Departments. In some cases after a trader has been) urged by one Government Department to accept an export order he has found that another Department has raised objections. GOVERNMENT WISHES Overseas Sales It is understood that a responsible Minister, probably Mr. Oliver Stanley, President of the Board of Trade, will take an opportunity of defining far more closely the Government's wishes in re- gard to exports and the kind of priority which will obtain. One of the matters which will come up for consideration is the direction of overseas sales. It will be the endeavour to foster trade with the British Empire, America, and with a number of other countries. On the other hand, the posi- tion of trade with neutrals contiguous with the enemy will have to be carefully scrutinised. On the experience gained in the last war it is probable that a scheme will be introduced rationing exports to these neutrals on the basis of average trade for the past three years. DEFENCE AND EXPORT Priority for Materials The Ministry of Supply is engaged upon the task of deciding in what manner priority should be given materials required oth for defence and for export trades. As far as possible the aim is to interfere as little as possible with the latter although it is realised that in the early days of war defence considerations must be paramount. Later, when the level of armament production is upon a more or less stable basis it will be possible to release more for civil needs. In two important industries export trade is being maintained. In the first, coal, shipments under license are going ahead briskly, as has already been reported in THE FINANCIAL TIMES. A certain amount of export business is also being done in certain classes of iron and steel. Exporters here require two licenses for this trade, the first from the Board of Trade, followed by another from the Steel Control. Some orders for iron and steel have had to be postponed because of the exigences of the war, but this trade has not been lost to this country because most other potential suppliers are equally preoccupied with defence calls. Sheets have not been readily available for export because of the heavy require- ments for obscuration and shelters and the many other articles for which this product is used. With the completion of the shelter and obscuration programme it is expected that more sheet will be available for overseas trade. On the other hand a large percentage of the output of tinplate is still available for export. Shipping difficulties here are of greater moment than supplies, since fewer neutral ships have been calling at the ports."

   "text_content" : "Poland's oilfields produced last year a total of 506,850 tons of crude oil. With a slight increase shown in the early months ithe current year's output would in normal circumstances have totalled about 520,000 ,tons. What would access to Poland's wells jmean to Germany? Assuming production ito be maintained at its recent level all the ifields would supply no more than 7 per cent. of the peace time consumption of the Greater Reich. It would be wrong to assume, however, that the whole of the production could be made available for use in Germany. Large quantities would be required by the armed forces maintained in the occupied terri- tory, apart from the civil needs of the country. FOR GERMANY OR RUSSIA? Moreover, the boundary reported as agreed upon by the German and Soviet Governments places many of the most im- portant oil-bearing districts of Poland inside the Russian sphere. Poland's production comes from a wide area along the northern foothills of the Carppthians. The oldest and still the most important centre of production is Drohlobycz, which is on the Russian side of the boundary. Although declining, the output of this district amounted to about 65 pea cent. of the country's total in 1938. Second in importance is the Jaslo dis- trict, which supplied some 27 per cent. of the total last year, followed by Stanis- lawow, which is of relatively little import- ance. The first of these is in the area reserved to Germany and the second falls to thei Soviet. All the crude produced has been treated in local refineries, of which there were about 28 in Poland before the war. DAMAGED PROPERTY To what extent both oilfields and re- fineries have been damaged either by the Poles themselves or by German bombers is not known. It is reported that many wells have been put out of operation in the Jaslo district, which has been the scene of fierce fighting, and it is fair to assume, there- fore, that it would take some time to restore production to normal, let alone to expand it. Even if the Germans should succeed eventualy in increasing the rate of Polish production in the area under their control no large expansion could be expected. It is more than likely that local consumption would increase on a scale sufficient to absorb any expansion and that Polish wells would be able to contribute little to Germany's needs.",

   "text_content" : "Proposals for a capital scheme are to be put before holders of Ordinary and Deferred stock in Clayton Dewandre, of Lincoln, shortly. They provide for an increase in capital from Â£260,000 (Â£195,000 in Ordinary and Â£65,000 in Deferred stock) to Â£500,000, capitalisation of Â£13,000, part of the Â£20,000 undistri- buted profits for distribution among holders of Deferred stock, thus giving them a capital bonus of 20 per cent., which, for legal reasons, will take the form of Ordinary shares to be converted into stock, the conversion of existing Deferred stock into Ordinary stock, and the adoption of new articles. If resolutions to this end are adopted holders of each Â£1 Deferred stock will hold Ordinary stock to the amount of Â£1 4s and there will remain Â£227,000 in shares avail- able for further issue. BUSINESS EXPANDING Mr. C. H. Dade, the chairman, in a cir- cular to holders of these stocks, states that business of the company continues to expand and the directors have no hesita- tion in recommending the increase of capital. As at present constituted, any profits are to be applied first in payment of 8 per cent. on the Ordinary and secondly in pay- ment of 8 per cent. on Deferred capital, the balance to be distributed as to one-half to each class. As the amount of Ordinary capital is three times that of the Deferred capital, it follows that, if it is decided to distribute more than 8 per cent. on the whole capital, the Deferred would receive three times as much of the excess over 8 per cent. as the Ordinary. In the opinion of the directors the proposed bonus is fair and reasonable having regard to the fact that holders of Deferred are being asked to convert into Ordinary stock. ORDINARY RIGHTS The Ordinary capital is now asked to relinquish its prior right to the first 8 per cent. and to allow the Deferred capital to rank pari passu with the Ordinary, while the Deferred capital is asked to give up its right to one half of the dividend over 8 per cent. and in consideration accept Â£1 4s in Ordinary stock for each Â£1 held in Deferred stock and to rank pari passu with the Ordinary stock in all respects. He adds that the directors have every reason to think that an interim dividend of not less than that paid last year (3 per cent.) on the Ordinary will be announced and, if the resolutions are passed, it will be received by present Deferred stock- holders who have not in the past received an interim payment. The scheme is subject to Treasury con- sent which will be applied for as soon as the necessary resolutions have been passed. The Ordinary stock is quoted at 20s and the Deferred at Is 3d. The company was formed to acquire the engineering section of Clayton Wagons. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 2",

   "text_content" : "The Chancellor of the Exchequer is expected to give some indication of the general monetary policy he hopes to pursue during the war when he opens his first war-time Budget on Wednesday. It is not unlikely that he will also give some hint of his borrowing plans. The general impression in the City is that the date of the first War Loan cannot be long delayed. A large proportion of the cost of the war must necessarily be financed by borrowing, but the Chancellor feels that there must be an all-round sacrifice by the people. For this reason the taxation net will be widely spread. The Chan- cellor, while imposing more additional direct taxation, will avoid as far as possible tapping sources of potential revenue too comprehensively in his war-time Budget. BANK RATE & GILT-EDGED With the Chancellor's taxation plans made known the Stock Exchange will be in a better position to adjust itself to current conditions. Part of the recovery of the last few days was attributed to the knowledge that by Wednesday the worst would be known. Following on the Budget the City is hoping that the Bank Rate may be adjusted and steps taken to unfreeze the gilt-edged market. The reasoning being followed is that none of these problems can be dealt with by itself. There must obviously be a close link between taxation, monetary policy and the gilt-edged market. RAILWAY COMPENSATION Another Government declaration awaited with interest is the announcement of the terms of compensation to be paid to railway stockholders during the period of Government control. The negotiations are almost concluded regarding the years which shall be fixed as the average revenue to form the basis of dividends, and the Government will announce the compensa- tion terms without delay.",

   "text_content" : "The spot quotation for raw rubber has still to find its proper level. The quotation a week ago was 9/d per pound, which compares with around 8%d before the outbreak of war, but, although esti- mates vary, it is expected eventually to settle down around 9d and 10Ad per pound. The subject is very much one of con- jecture, but it seems clear that the pro- ducing companies will eventually find their position rather better than it was say a month ago. More rubber is being produced, so that working costs should show a declining trend, although some addition will be made to expenses by increased freight charges. But for fears of increased taxation the Rubber share market would doubtless be more active. It is a reasonable assump- tion that rubber will further improve from its present level, and if it does market interests contend that share prices will follow suit. THE FINANCIAL TIMES last Monday published a list of prolific producers who might be expected to fare best under pre- vailing conditions. Below are particulars of other undertakings whose capital is in florin shares and whose capitalisation is moderate.

   "text_content" : "By THE MINING EDITOR The question of exactly what prices will be realised for their products still puzzles those interested in both the gold and the base-metal mines of the Empire. A maximum of Â£230 per ton has now been fixed for common tin, but although maxima are known to have been also agreed for copper, lead and spelter (zinc) the prices have not yet been officially announced. Silver has touched its highest price for some four years-a fact of considerable interest to Mexico, Burma and Broken Hill mixed-metal mines. UNION'S DECISION As regards gold, General Smuts's Government has reaffirmed the decision of its predecessor to take for the Treasury anything above 150s per ounce realised by the South African output. On a produc- tion of over 1,000,000 ozs monthly and with the London price of gold at 168s this levy will mean many millions a year extra revenue to the Union Government. Johannesbuig opinion hopes and rather expects that a substantial proportion of the proceeds of the new levy on gold will be devoted to assisting the arrival at the producing stage of those of the younger developing mines which are most ad- vanced. The more the output of gold can be expanded on sound lines the better not only for South Africa, but also for the Empire and its war chest. Australia has already recognised in part the validity of the protest raised by her mines against the hasty proposal to make a war levy of 75 per cent. of any excess over a gold price of Â£9 Australian. The Commonwealth Government has now fixed the excess duty at 50 per cent., which means that the mines will in present con- ditions receive 195s Australian (156s sterling) per ounce. WEST AFRICA'S POSITION West African gold mines bear an export duty of 15 per cent. on the excess of the gold price above the old par of 85s. Thus, out of 168s the levy is approximately 12s 6d an ounce. As Mr. J. H. Batty, the chairman of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, has urged:-\" Those mines nearing production -as distinct from those still in the pros- pecting stage-should be given every encouragement to be brought to the pro- duction stage and so assist the flow of gold to this country. Drastic and precipi- tate measures to appropriate a large pro- portion of any increase in the price of the metal . . . would frustrate this object.\" .JOHNNIES' FINANCES Holders of the Â£1 shares of Johannes- burg Consolidated will no doubt note with satisfaction that the company completes its golden jubilee well equipped financially to face the necessarily disturbed conditions that lie ahead. The balance-sheet at 30th June shows cash, South African Treasury bills, debtors and loans at short call totalling little less than Â£2,000,000. The reserve fund has not been added to on this occa- sion, but already stands at Â£8,050,000, against the issued capital of Â£3,950,000. For Rand finance concerns the outlook is clouded by the fact that, apart from the probable lack of opportunities for profit- able share market deals, it may well prove necessary to conserve earnings in order to assist non-producing subsidiaries. In this latter respect shareholders in Johnnies may be more favourably placed than holders of some other Finance issues, as their com- pany has not branched out in this direction during recent years. The further develop- ment of the Roodepoort district will no doubt be allowed to await more favourable times. Johnnies' stake in Rhodesian copper should help to offset declining revenue from the old-established gold mines of the group. MODDER EAST The consulting engineer's annual report on the progress of development at Modder East once again makes somewhat dispirit- ing reading. Shareholders, however, are probably getting used to the patchy nature of this Rand mine by now. Irregularity of the reef has not pre- vented a steady expansion of the ore reserves in recent years, albeit partly at the expense of declining gold value. At 30th June reserves of 6,468,500 tons, averaging 4.1 dwts (against a milling grade in recent months of about 3.5 dwts), represented 4% years' supply for the treatment plant. Capital expenditure in the past year was only Â£17,214, against Â£120,968 in 1937-38, and it is stated that future requirements under this heading should be on a modest scale. Thus generous earnings distribur tions should be possible. Net profits, after taxation, have recently been running at an annual rate of little under 8s a share. The June dividend of 4s brought the 1938-39 payment up to the record level of 7s 6d. On this basis the shares yield 9 per cent. at 82s 6d, which is about right in normal circum- stances with the life prospect only in the medium class."

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT SWANSEA, Saturday. The report from Canberra that the Australian Tariff Board had decided to encourage the Broken Hill Proprietary Company to proceed with the establish- ment of a tinplate industry in Australia has aroused rather anxious interest here. \" It is a serious loss to the South Wales tinplate industry, but the works at Broken Hill cannot be erected much under three years,\" was the comment of one prominent authority. The terms proposed simply meant, he added, that the Board was prepared to give a duty on imported tinplates to bring the cost up to Â£32 (Australian) per ton c.i.f. when tin was Â£A.280 per ton, and, if the export canners could not compete, then they proposed to give them a bounty guaranteeing to the home product a price not exceeding Â£31 10s per ton. With tin at Â£280, it was, in effect, a duty of 10s in favour of Australian tinplates, apart from the question of currency. The Board, he added, had ignored the representations made by the Welsh manufacturers.",

The Department's liability will be limited to 75 per cent. of each debt and its total liability will at no time exceed Â£4,000,000 sterling, of which not more than Â£1,000,000 will be in respect of shipments falling due for payment subsequent to 30th June, 1940. Provision is made under which the A Department may extend the facilities to cover shipments made after 30th June next under such conditions as circumstances then warrant. GUARANTEES AVAILABLE Guarantees will be available to U.K. ex- porters in connection with the commercial export to New Zealand of goods wholly or partly produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom. The agreement applies to payments due in respect of goods shipped from the U.K. to New Zealand between 1st August last and 30th June next, in respect of which the purchasers make irrevocable deposits in New Zealand of local currency to a value equivalent to the full amount of the debt. EXCHANGE LOSS PROTECTION In order to protect both the U.K. ex- porter and the New Zealand importer against loss on transactions resulting from an adverse movement in the rate of ex- change the New Zealand Government has arranged for the granting in New Zealand of remittance authorities by the Reserve Bank to each licensed importer indicating the particular month or months up to June, 1940, in which sterling funds to cover his imports will be made available to him. Further, by arrangement with the Reserve Bank, the New Zealand trading banks have been authorised to enter into forward sterling exchange arrangements with licensed importers. The effect of the arrangements made in New Zealand is that from the time an importer has deposited the amount due for purchase of goods exported from the U.K. the New Zealand Government, through the Reserve Bank, guarantees that payment of sterling at the then cur- rent rate of exchange will be made to the U.K. exporter. DEFERRED REMITTANCES \" Exporters to New Zealand can rely on the successful working of the deferred remittance procedure of the Reserve Bank,\" says the High Commissioner for New Zealand. \" If, however, they require additional safeguards and particularly if they need immediate finance, they can avail themselves of the guarantees offered by the Export Credits Guarantee Depart- ment which should enable them to obtain the necessary accommodation through the ordinary banking channels.\" Full particulars of the conditions under which the guarantees will be made avail- able and the premiums payable can be obtained from the Export Credits Guarantee Department, 9, Clement's-lane, E.C.4, or any of its branches. The United Kingdom (as announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on 21st July) planned to grant New Zealand export credits for Â£9,000,000 sterling. Of the total credit, Â£5,000,000 is being made available through the Export Credits Guarantee Department for defence pur- chases of British goods by the New Zealand Government. The remaining Â£4,000,000 is being applied as outlined above.",

   "text_content" : "NEW YORK. 23rd Sept. The steel operating rate is increasing rapidly. Those mills which are not com- pletely booked up are limiting acceptances of orders to reasonable amounts. The rail- ways are entering for heavy tonnages, and the reaffirmation of prices has failed to slow down demand. On the contrary, it has stimulated efforts to cover against anticipated advances on 1st January. The boom in the scrap market has been the most outstanding development of the past week, with the quotation now ranging from $5 to $7 higher than the midsummer price. Pig-iron has experienced a lively scramble. Eastern Pennsylvania, delivered New York, is unchanged on the week at 26.50, and Buffalo, delivered Boston, is also unaltered at 24.50. Demand for copper, spelter and lead con- tinues to exceed supply, but business is proceeding more calmly as producers' conservative selling attitude and assur- ances of no shortage are helping to relieve pressure. Copper producers' export price is unchanged on the week at 11.75c per pound. Spelter is unchanged on the week at 6.25. In lead, spot New York and spot East St. Louis are both unchanged on the week at 5.50 and 5.35 per pound respec- tively. As regards tin, a frantic demand for any descriptions for September-October de- livery is resulting in fantastic premiums, ignoring all relationship between import cost and sales price. Straits tin prompt has been variously reported sold at be- tween 70c and 80c per pound, while English refined is quoted at 62c to 65c. No prices were established this week. Pro- duction of tinplates is stepping up with the re-entry of long-idle capacity; the price per box f,o.b. Pittsburg basis is un- changed on the week at $5.-Reuter. STRAITS TIN PRICE SINGAPORE, 24th Sept. In substitution of the maximum tin price of Â£230 the Straits Settlements Governor has fixed a maximum price for delivery from works at Singapore and Penang of $117% (about Â£12 15s) per picul of 133Y lbs.-Ex.
