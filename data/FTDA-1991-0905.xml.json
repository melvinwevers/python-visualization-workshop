The move marked a radical depar- ture from decades of policy based on racial segregation.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent THE government yesterday cut interest rates by half a percent- age point, triggering a reduc- tion in some mortgage rates and fuelling speculation of a November general election. Clearing bank base rates fell to 10.5 per cent from 11 per cent shortly after the Bank of England cut its money market dealing rates in a move that surprised many in the City. There had been growing expectations of a rate cut to coincide with an anticipated sharp fall in the annual rate of retail prices inflation at the end of next week. The Bank's action was seen by many commentators as a sign that the government was reviving the possibility of an autumn general election after the publication of a weekend opinion poll that gave the Con- servatives a 2 percentage point lead over Labour. While the Treasury and the Bank insisted the rate cut reflected falling inflation and was consistent with the gov- ernment's need to keep sterling within its fluctuation bands in the European Monetary Sys- tem, the nation's bookmakers and the Labour party were quick to see it as a prelude to an early election. Ladbroke shortened its odds against a November election from 94 to 64 while William Hill moved its odds from 5-to-2 to 5-to-4 and made the Conser- vatives 8-to-l favourites. - Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, told Independent Tele- vision News that the govern- ment wanted to call the elec- tion before Christmas \"to try to avoid the continuing effects of the recession\". He said November 7, which is widely tipped as a possible election date, \"suits me just fine\". In a statement, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, described yesterday's rate cuts at \"very good news for indus- Tory waiting game; Abbey National leads cut.....Page 7 Editorial Comment......Page 12 Lex......................... Page 14 Government bonds.....Page 24 London stocks.............Page 42 try and consumers up and down the country\". He said he hoped the cuts would \"consoli- date the very marked improve- ment in confidence that we have seen in recent weeks\". The rate cuts had little impact on financial markets and received a guarded wel- come from business. While the Confederation of British Industry said the cuts should help rebuild confidence, Mr Miles Middleton, president of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"We only hope that this move in the interest rate has not come too late for many businesses.\" Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute 6f Directors, said there was a strong domestic case for a fur- ther cut in October. Yesterday's move prompted Britain's two largest mortgage lenders to cut their rates. Abbey National, the second largest lender, moved first with a 0.4 point cut to 11.55 per cent in its core mortgage rate for loans under Â£60,000 and slightly smaller cuts in the rates on larger loans. It was then undercut by Halifax Building Society which reduced its basic mortgage rate by 0.45 points to 11.5 per cent. City analysts believe the government hopes yesterday's rate cuts could produce a snowball effect of increased popularity that will feed through into an improved standing in the opinion polls. This would encourage interna- tional investors to buy sterling, allowing a further rate cut around the time of the main party conferences next month. Inflation is set to continue falling sharply until October at least, as last year's large increases in petrol prices drop out of the retail prices index. Moreover, with parliament in recess, Mr John Major, prime minister, should be able to make the most of his high pro- file activities on the interna- tional stage. Mr Major wants to win his own mandate to govern in a general election. These factors, taken together, fuelled specula- tion yesterday that he might be persuaded to call a Novem- ber election if he is confident of winning. But Mr Chris Pat- ten, Conservative chairman, continues to believe the party should defer the election until next year. His argument is that it should see growing political benefit from economic recov- ery by then and have a more sustained opinion poll lead.",

   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Belgrade and Quentin Peel in Bonn SOME OF the worst fighting for weeks in Yugoslavia left 16 people dead yesterday after Serb militants, backed by the Yugoslav federal army, attacked several villages in the breakaway republic of Croatia. The attack left Croatia virtu- ally split, with the eastern regions of the republic firmly under Serb control while the rest faces the prospect of fresh assaults. The wave of violence came just two days before European Community foreign ministers and Yugoslav leaders open a peace conference on the future of Yugoslavia. It coincided with renewed warnings by the German government that it would give formal diplomatic recognition to Croatia and Slo- venia if there was no immedi- ate end to the fighting. Speak- ing in Bonn, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, German foreign min- ister, warned that \"every shot fired brings recognition closer\". Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that \"if dialogue and peaceful exchange are no longer possi- ble, then the question must arise for us, whether to recog- nise under international law those republics which no lon- ger wish to belong to Yugo- slavia\". As he spoke, several hundred Serbs protested out- side the German embassy in Belgrade, accusing Germany of siding with Croatia. The fighting underlined the completeness of the breakdown of a ceasefire agreed last week- end between BC officials and the presidents of Yugoslavia's six republics. Zagreb radio said the fight- ing was centred on villages around Okucani, a town 70 miles east of Zagreb, the Cro- atian capital, which was occu- pied by Serb militants and fedl- eral army units. T us, the Belgrade-based ofUil Yugoslav news agency, said, however, that \"Croatian forces without provocation attacked Serbian villages in Slavonia\", the region of east- ern Croatia. Yesterday's battles in effect sealed off Slavonia from the rest of Croatia and cut the country's main motorway between Zgreb sad graide, the Serbin and federal capital. Mr Milan Brmak, Croatia's deputy defene minister, ndd Serbian terrorists had massed on the motorway, and were headed towards Zagreb. He added that Podravska Slatina, a town in north central Croa- tia, had also come under army attack. Tanjug reported that the fed- eral army was \"removing bar- ricades and mines\" south of the main motorway on a bridge joining Croatia and the repub- lic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Confirmation of these reports would indicate that Serb militants are establishing positions in northern Bosnia- CSCE calls for arms embargo A meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation In Europe, meeting In Prague, called yesltrday for an embargo on arms supplies to all warring partles In Yugoslavla. The action was Initiated by Poland, co-sponsored by Csechoslovmakl. Hercegovina from which to attack western Croatia. Serb militants refuse to live in an independent Croatia on the grounds that the Croatian government discriminates against the 600,000 Serb com- munity which make up 12 per cent of the republic's popula- tion. Several Serb-inhabited regions of Croatia have declared autonomy from the republic. Serb militants, backed by Mr Slobodan Milos- evic, Serbia's president, seek to join these regions with Serbia. Elsewhere, two Moslems died near Bratunac, 120km northwest of Sarajevo, the cap- ital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, in some of the first reported fight- ing between Slavic Moslems and Serbs in the republic. Western diplomats said yes- terday that the Yugoslav army was ignoring last weekend's ceasesre and now appeared to be openly siding with the Serbs. The federal armystands to loe half its om rpts on Sep tember 20 as all the republic except Serbia and Monteegro, have announced that they will enftwe to send new recruits.",

   "text_content" : "By Qum tnh P I in tionn MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday issued a strong warning that the Soviet Union must pre- serve a common foreign policy, a united military command and a single coherent economic programme for it to do busi- ness with the western world. His statement, the toughest yet by the German government which has provided the lion's share of aid to the Soviet Union in the past two years - revealed a grave concern at the disintegration process under- way there. It suggests Germany is mov- ing closer to the British and US position within the Group of Seven leading industrial coun- tries by stressing conditions on aid, although Mr Kohl's partic- ular emphasis on the need for unified policies goes beyond concerns expressed by other western leaders. He quoted EC figures show- ing that Germany had already provided an estimated 56 per cent of all financial aid to the Soviet Union, and 32 per cent of all aid to the rest of eastern Europe in the past two years - more than DM90bn, (Â£30.6bn), DM60bn of which went to Moscow. \"We Germans are already at the limit of our capacity\" to provide assis- tance, he said. While paying warm tribute to the role of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in stop- ping the August coup by bard- line Communists and the secu- rity forces, Mr Kohl threw all his weight behind President Mikhall Gorbachev's efforts to preserve the basis of a \"renewed Soviet Union.\" His comments came as the Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Union's saprema lawmaking body, delayed until today any binding decision on a new structure devolvyilI much power to the epublics. His overview of foreign pol- icy, presented in the budget debate of the Bundestag, con- centrated almost entirely on the turmoil in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Mr Kohl called for the strongest support for Mr Gorbachev's attempt to create a renewed Soviet Union of sovereign republics, express- ing \"unity in diversity\" - although he explicitly excluded the Baltic republics, whose independence he welcomed. Continued on Page 14 Power shift; US nuclear stance, Page 2 Kohl Contanued fom Page 1 \"Obviously what matters is to carry out a whole series of tasks united and in common,\" he said. \"That includes, not least, both external relations and security. \"The armed forces must have a single command. Weap- ons, and above all nuclear weapons, must also be kept under central control in the future.\" He repeated the concern, expressed on Tuesday by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that some- body must take responsibility for all the international debts and obligations of the Soviet Union. Mr Waigel's statement was made as a precondition for further Western aid. Mr Kohl, meanwhile, urged the republics to create a single, free economic space, and called for the immediate development of \"a coherent economic pro- gramme.\" \"Only in this way can a reliable framework for effective - and additional - western help be put in place,\" he added.",

   "text_content" : "My Ltk ouMon and PRESIDENT ilikhail Gorb- acher is expected today to simmon ill his powers of per sualoir to. push through the moribind parliamenta plan to alvage what is left of the Soviet Union. Recoveringmuch of his for- mer self-co ldE r sGorba- chev yesterday bullied the Con- en of People's Deputies into areeing to discuss the latet draft of a plan transferring political supremacy to the epublics. But the Soviet Union's rame law-making body put Svoting until today, to give lawmakers time overnight to amend the proposals so they can obtain a two-thirds major- ity needed for constitutional amendments. However, the Congress will leave the question orecognis Ing Baltic independence off the agenda. Mr Algimantas Cekuolls, a Lithuanian deputy, said Mr Gorbachev planned to recog- nise the independence of Lith- uania, Estonia and Latvia by decree. He said three decrees had been drafted by the three republics for the president to sign, although it is unclear when. Teading radicals, Mr Gorba- chev's new allies since the failed putsch, urged deputies to support the plan for a new con- federation and place the national interest above selfish fears for their own careers. \"If we don't take this deci- sion, then all the plotters and speakers who supported them will applaud you,\" said Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of Leningrad and one of the most authoritative voices in parlia- ment. But this did not stop a last-ditch call for resistance to the plan from Col Viktor Alks- nis, a leader of the hardline Soyuz faction, who said it would destroy the Union. \"We are responsible before our state's 1,000-year history,\" he warned. \"Why are we sit- ting here and remaining silent?\" The latest draft, resented yesterday, increesNIrum- -ar of seats for the Russian Federation in tbheCouncil of Republics, the q#Mi40s.,pw . of the two houses in the pro- posed new parliament. But Russia would still have one vote, the same as other republics, despite the fact that the country's biggest republic would hold 45 seats, as opposed to only 20 for the others, in the Council of Republics. Until more permanent arrangements and fresh elec- tions, deputies would be cho- sen by republican parliaments. As foreseen by initial drafts, a State Council comprising President Gorbachev and republic leaders would carry the real clout in a new transi- tional system for Union deci- sion-making. The post of vice-president, last occupied by Mr Gennady Yanayev, the disgraced titular coup leader, would be dropped. An inter-republican economic committee would co-ordinate whatever is salvaged of a com- mon economic y. The new drat lso provides for negotiations with republics which decide to shun a new confederation. Each republic in the new confederation would determine how much power it kept for itself and what would be delegated to the Union. If the parliament falls to take a decision today, the signs are it may be bypassed altogether bythe republics Plans to dissolve the more than 80 central ministries are ready to be implemented as soon as the Congress is over. Mr Alexander Shokhin, Rus- s's new labour minister, said in an interview yesterday that the Inter-republcan commit- tee, foreseen by the new plan, would employ a small number Others could find jobs with new republic ministries, which - set to take over mst of the finctions of their discredited Unron counterprt.",

   "text_content" : "ECONOMIC reform in the Sov$et Union is now impossible, because there is no centre on whichto base it. At best, what can now be expected is agreement by the republics to mit- Igte the dsruption of links between republics and enterprises, and to make what arrangements they can to avoid an economic collapse in the coming hard winter. This has become evident in the three days of the extraordinary see sion of the Congress of Peoples' Dep- uties - in spite of the procession of republican leaders to the podium to pledge agreement to renew the union on a new basis. It is now very doubtful that a Union Treaty in any form, and with it a new Soviet constitution, will be signed. Only an economic agree- ment - and a loose one at that - is now in prospect. Hardlmne deputies, resisting plans for a new confederation, sign a petition yesterday.

Professor Stanislav Shatalin, the tveadfnearly an^ of them pty prime over the knd He says he secuMred broad agreement from them thit such a framewor was peoesary It Is conaived, ower, as a very loose arangement. Professorl Shat- ain accepts that a numWne f repub- lics may adopt their own currencies, and has proposed only that a com- mon currency, the rouble, be used for inter-republican accounting, while other currencies be used within the Individual states. Many prominent economists doubt that any binding agreement can be reached by the republics of what is now routinely described as the \"for- mer Soviet Union\". r Igor Gadar, directr of the Higher Commercial School at the 1rtthe cf|atte dibnister the economy but no S^\"thlorz the republicr bhave me auwÂ·ithi tyutho shrutur The Umain task a, he sees it, is not ti pull authoritybaick to the centre, but to recognise rality and devolve executive authority, and the means to enforce it, to the republics.

   "text_content" : "By John Thornhill MR Ernest Obminsky, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, said yesterday that Moscow and the republics should urgently address the question of dividing the Soviet Union's $65bn foreign debt. Speaking in London after talks with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Mr Obminsky said the Soviet Union was committed to repaying the debt \"but in the new conditions negoti- ations on how to tackle this problem should be speeded up.\" In spite of the political fragmentation in the Soviet Union, Mr Obminsky said that western creditors should be able to deal with a single co-ordinating body. \"The Western creditors should not have to go to Kazakhstan or Turkmenia saying 'what will you repay us'. The republics should channel the money through a central authority which will deal with the west in repaying the money.\" He added that the republics had already agreed that the Soviet Union's debt should be parelled out between them although the method had not yet been decided. But, whether the debt was divided on a per capita basis or as a proportion of each republic's income, Russia would be respon- sible for the bulk of it, he said. Mr Obminsky held out the possibility that some debt could be converted into investments in Soviet enterprises via debt- for-equity swaps. \"The emphasis should be about switch- ing from official loans to direct invest- ment,\" he said. He will shortly hold smeetings with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the US although represen- tatives of the two bodies might first visit Moscow on September 23. Mr Obminsky described the reaction of the EBRD to the Soviet delegation as \"very enthusiastic\" and said there had been some discussion about changing the limits on the amount of financial assis- tance the bank could provide. At present, the EBRD is restricted to lending up to $235m (Â£139.8m) over the next three years.",

   "text_content" : "By SphenM Fdler A CONTINUED withdrawal of sands by foreign banks from the Soviet Union this year will leave foreign governments, mainly in the west, as the Soviet Union's main creditors, according to a report distrib- uted privately to international banks this week.a The report, from the Insti- tute of International Finance, the Wauhington-based research group fded mainly by intera national banks, makes clear that western governments will become the dominant Soviet creditor, even if there is no increase in aid following the failure of last month's -ttmpted coup. The report concludes that in theory the Soviet Union should be ae to service all its foreign debt principal ad interest obli- gat this year.

The conclusion that the debt can be serviced hangs on a forecast current account sur- plus in hard currency of $3.5b (E2.0tba) (against a deicit of that sle in 1990) and a draw- down from Soviet reserves of $bn (2.9Obn), which the IIF assumes will be achieved through gold Sal. t ays nw leanding by for- eign banks wll continue at a very low level this year and banks will reduce short-tera credits by more than $6bn (Â£3.5bn) following a fall last year of $lObn (f5.9bn). Total outflows to banks are expected to total $9.5bn (t5.65bn) this year against $18bn (97.7bn) in 1960. Total debt outstanding to banks at the end of this year is forecast to fall to $16bn (29.5bn) from $37.2bn (Â£22.lbn) at the end of 199. Arrears on trade credits to Soviet nterprses - estimated at about (Â£2.9bn) at the end of last year - are seen as likely to remain. Assuming no big new loan disbursements are made by western governments, official medium and long-term credits could amount to S1fba (7.1bn) this year. This will mean the share of the debt held by bilateral gov- ernment creditors will have risen by the end of this year to about 0 per cent, fom 38 per cent at the end of last year and 23 per cent at the end of IMB.",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington and Our Foreign Staff MR JAMES Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday set out five principles govern- ing future relations with the Soviet Union, and declared that Washington would like the Soviet nuclear arsenal under one \"central command authority\". Speaking ahead of next week's trip to Moscow - the first by a senior Bush adminis- tration official since the abor- tive putsch - Mr Baker pledged US support for peace- ful, democratic change and urged the new leadership to develop a comprehensive eco- nomic reform plan as soon as possible. Mr Baker also warned offi- cials of the Soviet Union and its republics to respect existing borders, internal and external. Reflecting US concern about future instability, Mr Baker said. \"There can be no legiti- mate place for threats, intimi- dation, coercion or violence.\" During his talks, Mr Baker said he would be guided by five principles: that the future of the Soviet Union is for the Soviet people to decide them- selves; respect of existing bor- ders; the support of peaceful change through \"orderly demo- cratic processes\"; respect of human rights and, finally, respect of existing treaty com- mitments - a reference to arms control pacts. Mr Baker will be attending a previously scheduled confer- ence in Moscow on human rights as part of the Helsinki process, but he will also hold talks with central Soviet authorities and leaders of the Republics, and plans to visit the Baltic republic of Latvia on Sunday. In Lithuania yesterday, Mr Douglas Hogg, the first British minister to visit the Baltics in 50 years, said that Britain was keen to help the republic in every way possible but remained evasive over the question of compensation for Baltic gold. \"We have not come to any firm proposal about the gold...but we want to be con- structive,\" said Mr Hogg, for- eign office minister of state. The gold was deposited in Britain by the Baltic states during their brief period of independence before Soviet annexation in 1910. Now val- ued at about $160m (95.2m), it was sold by the British govern- ment in the 1960s to settle a British-Soviet dispute. Lithuanian central bank gov- ernor Mr Vilus Baldisis yester- day said the republic could introduce its own currency even without the gold reserves being returned. In another development, Lat- via yesterday opened the way for the return of foreigners' property seized after the Soviet annexation. \"We are ready to recognise the rights of ownership of all kinds of foreign owners, but how they will get their prop- erty back... that is to be decided by other laws,\" said the Latvian parliamentary dep- uty, Mr Andris Grutups. Meanwhile, the president of Moldova yesterday issued decrees in a bid to end the Soviet military presence and create a republican army. In the northern Caucasus region of Chechen-Ingush yes- terday armed militias seized the television and radio sta- tions after accusing local lead- ers of ting last month's coup. The mi announced the local authorities had been deposed, Tas said.",

   "text_content" : "By Chrystl Freland in Kiev UKRAINIAN nationalist deputies yesterday gained con- trol of the republic's parlia- ment while outside, as the Soviet flag still fluttered, a large demonstration over- turned police barricades and stormed the building chanting \"Down with the red rag\". The visibly shaken govern- ment despatched a former dis- sident, Mr Levko Lukianenko, to tell the crowd it would be replaced by the Ukraine's yel- low and blue national colours, which less than a year ago it was illegal to display. As they waited, \"Down with Kravchuk\" was another com- mon cry. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the ex-communist leader of the Ukraine, had manoeuvred par- liament into accepting a com- promise to a long-standing dis- pute over national symbols by threatening to resign if MPs did not vote to have both the communist flag and the national one flown atop their buildings. Yesterday's events were thus a personal setback for him. The Ukraine, the second most powerful Soviet republic, is now likely to steer a more radical course towards inde- pendence. The Communist party, tradi- tionally the most orthodox in the Union, had attempted to overturn the government's decision last week to disband the party. But although 324 of the 450 MPs were communists before the failed putsch, yester- day the party could muster only 50 votes. The democrats used their new majority to dismiss the communist attorney general of the republic, Mr Mykhail Pote- benko, and replace him with a member of their caucus, Mr Viktor Shyshkyn. The sacking was particularly poignant because Mr Pote- benko is the man, responsible for jailing many of the former dissidents who are now taking charge. Deputies yesterday voted to restore the parliamen- tary immunity of Mr Stepan Khmara, who was imprisoned by Mr Potebenko last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Duld S Budhn In Brusselis CHANGES In east Europe increpse the need for the Euro- pean Community to prepare for a possible doubling of its current membership by \"deep- ening\" its integration and adapting its institutions, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, said yes- terday. \"It's quite clear that the present institutional structure of the EC is not conceived for a Community of 24 members or more\", he said. Taking deci- sions by unanimity in a Coun- cil with 24 ministers would be impossible, while an EC execu- tive with 30 commissioners or a European parliament, with 1,200 deputies would be equally unthinkable. Mr Andriessen was com- menting on the implications of a series of proposals that the Commission decided yesterday to put to EC foreign ministers tomorrow. These proposals would put five east European countries on the road to even- tual EC membership, as well as starting trade and aid negotia- tions that could give Albania and the three Baltic states the same status. The commissioner said he regretted that, in negotiations on political union, the Twelve were ignoring the enlargement issue, although there was a chance they might do so at their special summit - in early October - on the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. \"Ideally, we should change the [Community's] institutional structure first, and then tackle enlargement. Now we shall have to do both together.\" Behind Mr Andriessen's pre- diction on EC membership is the assumption that other members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) will soon follow Austria and Swe- den in knocking on Brussels' door, while a further half dozen applications will come from east Europe. His prescription for match- ing institutional change would require another inter-govern- mental conference (IGC) in the mid-1990s. Seeking to exploit height- ened political concern about the EC's eastern neighbours, the Commission will tomorrow ask EC governments to agree to a radical improvement in market access for Poland, Hun- gary and Czechoslovakia. Com- plaints about EC protectionism from those countries have held up negotiations on their associ- ation accords with the EC. The association agreements, paving the way for free trade, should be extended to Romania and Bulgaria, the Commission decided yesterday. Preliminary trade talks are also to open with Albania. Mr Andriessen said he would discuss trade and aid with Bal- tic governments in Tallinn next week, and the future of EC aid for the Soviet Union when he travelled to Moscow and Kiev.",

This is. mieim i 1on of the Organisatio farbMOp- nomico-operation and Devl- opment's annual survey of Denmark, published yester- day. In its positive report the OECD argues that Danish recovery looks set to continue as long as the government sticks to policies to reduce the country's high foreign debt and does not weaken its fiscal restraint. The government is praised for its commitment to stable exchange rates, curbs on gov- ernment spending and for dampening domestic demand. The survey says Denmark can expect to consolidate the gains of its economic stabilisation for the next two years, with low inflation and a continuing current account surplus. The only gloomy note con- cerns unemployment, which is expected to average 9.8 per cent this year and 9.2 per cent in 1992.",

The impact of reunification and industrial restructuring on east German employment has so far been less than expected. Although some 220,000 people in the new Lnder lost their jobs in July, the figure was well below some economists' forecasts. They had expected up to 600.000 job losses during the month, following the expiry of no-dismissal deals in the metals and chemicals ustries.

It is proposing a 60 per cent cut in the level of tariffs over three years on imports of these products. The preferential treatment includes an increase in volume by 50 per cent over five years. On textiles, Brussels pro- poses that curbs on the import of central European textiles be phased out within six years. This is likely to be opposed by Portugal and Spain.",

   "text_content" : "Break wits the past: The last remaining statue o01 former Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha was demolished in a Tirana museum this week OR THE fledgling demo- r cratic movement in Albania - trying to upyÃ½t the legacy of 45 years of tcommunism by shouldering respnsi5bility for economic refiormf- the failed coup in the Soviet Union offers an unex- 01e-ed political opportunity. During two months spent co- operating with the ex-commu- ilst Albania n Party of Labour (APL) in a national unity gov- iernnent, the Democratic party, :'which holds most economic portfolios, has made little prog- ress in easing the lot of the hard-pressed population. It is clear that many of the old Stalinist taboos have been swept away: hundreds of sec- ond-hand vehicles, mostly imported from Yugoslavia, cir- culate among the bicycles in Tirana, the capital; churches and mosques are packed with worshippers; and school text- books are being rewritten to expunge references to Enver Hoxha, the dictator who kept the country in poverty-stricken isolation for so long. But the Democrats' popular- ity is being eroded by their fail- ure to improve the food supply, halt a surge in unemployment - now exceeding 30 per cent - or prevent restive young Alba- nians, frustrated in their urge to emigrate, from turning to theft and violence. Mr Fiqiri Xibre, leader of the independent miners' union whoue strife in May brought down the communist govern- ment elected earlier this year, said:, \"We gave everyone a brethihng space to start the reformt process. But steam is *uidiMng again because people .:re dissatisied with the slow rate of change. Things must go faster.\" However, with Soviet com- munism suddenly disgraced, THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said yesterday its board of directors had recom- mended that Albania's mnemberhip application be approved, AP-DJ reports from London. Albania, which will hold a 1 per cent stake in the EBRD once its membership application is formally approved by the board of governors, U be the last east European country to become a shareholder in the London-based bank. the influence still wielded by President Ramiz Alia and other survivors of the Hoxha era - known as the \"blokists\" after the leafy block in the city cen- tre where they lived in heavily guarded villas - will wither more quickly. If they want to, the Demo- crats can take advantage of mounting popular pressure for a settling of accounts with the old guard. The Finance Ministry has launched an investigation into the affairs of almost 30 fami- lies, including the Hoxhas and the Alias, accused of enriching themselves from state funds. There is already debate on whether President Alia's immunity from prosecution should be lifted. Dr Sell Berisha, the cardiolo- gist who heads the DP, says he wants to bring forwatd from next summer to November or December the date for elec- tions. This was \"because there are so many obstacles, so many conspiracies raised by people who don't want reforms\". Leading DP members are well aware that their inability to deliver an economic miracle over the summer has added to the taint of their willingness to join forces with the commu- nists. Still, when it comes to an election, voters have little choice but to support the DP, although Dr Berisha and Mr Gramoz Pashko, deputy prime minister and architect of eco- nomic reform, may lose per- sonal support. Much will depend on the result of Albania's appeals for food aid from western coun- tries. Mr Pashko says $300m (Â£178.5m) will be needed to get through the winter, following a collapse in agricultural outjut as peasants abandoned grain production in favour of culti- vating private plots carved out of cooperative holdings. Now, all cooperative land is to be officially privatised in an effort to ensure next year's cereal crop is planted on time. According to Mr Pashko, industrial output fell 33 per cent in the first half of 1991, partly because of strikes but also because of a shortage of hard currency for purchasing raw materials. Exports have plunged 80 per cent. Mr Pashko's plans for introd- ucing a market economy, due to be launched next month, call for privatising 25,000 state enterprises and closing unprod- uctive factories. Initial esti- mates suggest another 15 per cent of the country's workforce will be made redundant, although some social assis- tance is to be paid. Privatisation is viewed with trepidation by workers who already spend almost their entire monthly salary on food. Annual inflation, once unknown, has outstripped 30 per cent. Yet enthusiasm for private enterprise is beginning to emerge, spurred by some energetic factory directors and the sons of former merchants already active in running pri- vate restaurants and repair shops who have formed a 300- strong association in Tirana.",

   "text_content" : "Rv Kevin Brown in Sinamore SINGAPORE'S ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will con- tinue to allow limited freedom of expression, but further liber- alisation moves will be put on hold, Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, said yesterday. In an interview, Mr Goh said he had reassessed his initially \"despondent\" view of the out- come of Saturday's general election, in which the PAP's share of the popular vote fell by 22 per cent to 61 per cent. The two opposition parties, Mr Chiam See Tong's centrist Singapore Democratic Party and Mr JB Jayaretnam's cen- tre-left Workers' Party, won four seats, compared with one at the last election in 1988. Mr Goh said he had been dis- appointed by the initial results because they were interpreted as a rejection of the more lib- eral style he has cultivated since replacing the autocratic Mr Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister in November. However, detailed analysis indicated that the opposition vote increased because the PAP failed to communicate with working-class Chinese voters in low-income constitu- encies. \"The group which we are not reaching wants firm govern- ment; all they are interested in is steady progress and prosper- ity. They do not care how we are running the place,\" he said. Mr Goh said the lesson of the election was that he had paid too much attention to liberall- sing Singapore, while the party failed to notice it was losing support in its heartlands. The government's response would be to press ahead with policies designed to provide more opportunities for lower income Singaporeans, includ- ing two S$5bn (Â£1.73bn) endow- ment funds to improve access to educational and medical ser- vices. He also heralded a change in the PAP's traditional strategy of selecting its candidates from among the business and aca- demic dlite, acknowledging that many of the candidates were too remote from the vot- ers. \"We need to getgovernment people who can go into the cos- fee shops and mount a whis- pering campaign against the opposition,\" he said. The PAP suffered seriously in the elec- tion from the opposition's abil- ity to use word-of-mouth cam- paigns to counter the favourable government propa- ganda in most of the press. Mr Goh said there would be no return to the autocratic approach of Mr Lee, indicating that the relative freedom of newspaper letters columns, publishing and private radio would continue. However, the government would keep \"a watch\" on the scale of dissent, noting that Singapore \"is still an Asian society, and Singaporeans do not like to see their leaders caricatured, especially if it is malicious\". Further liberalisation would have to take place at the slower pace acceptable to the PAP's core voters, rather than at the pace favoured by the English-speaking intellectual elite, he said. Mr Goh said the election had exposed his liberal approach to pressure from the conservative wing of the PAP, led by Briga- dier General Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Lee's son. However, he said his posi- tion was safe until the results of by-elections to be held in 12 to 18 months time. Mr Goh said he expected close results in the by-elections, which he prom- ised would provide an opportu- nity for Mr Jayaretnam to stand following the expiry of a five-year ban from parliament. The prime minister said he accepted that the \"ground rules\" for Singapore politics had changed as a result of the election, and repeated his elec- tion night undertaking to work with the opposition in parlia- ment. He said no action would be taken against opposition politicians who are accused of stimulating ethnic tensions between Singapore's Chinese majority and the Malay and Indian minorities. However, the Internal Secu- rity Act, which permits deten- tion without trial on the recommendation of a minister and a tribunal, will remain on the statute books.",

In a meeting of economic ministers, called yesterday to discuss the rising deficit, and presided over by Mr Choi Gak Kyu, the minister for economic planning, it was also decided to reduce access to foreign loans for the import of capital goods and machinery. South Korea's trade deficit totalled $8.78bn (25.22bn) on a customs cleared basis in the first eight months of this year. This compares with a deficit of $4.bn last year and a surplus of $8.88bn in 198. \"It is the speed of deteriora- tion which is of greatest con- cern,\" said one senior govern- ment economist. \"We have seen a swing in the trade bal- ance equivalent to almost 10 per cent of Gross National Product since 19K8.\" Officials argue that one of the principal factors in the widening deficit this year had been the sharp increase in imports of crude oil. In the first seven months of the year, oil imports amounted $4.49bn, an increase of almost 40 per cent over the comparable period last year. At the same time, the gov- ernment said that it would reduce the number of new houses to be built this year from 700,000 to 650,000 with fur- ther reductions next year, in an attempt to cool the over- heated construction sector and limit imports of construction equipment.",

   "text_content" : "By ULonl Brber in Washington THERE is a tale, no doubt apocryphal, about a young man who turned up at President George Bush's summer home at Kennebunkport, Maine, holding a large placard \"Unemployed - but very willing to caddy.\" Mr Bush's penchant for golf has long been the butt of jokes, but Democratic party strategists these days like to argue that the story pinpoints a presi- dential Achilles heel domestic issues. For all his popularity and his conif dent handling of the Soviet crisis, the ictures which appear with ever greater requency on US television tell a differ ent story. Crumbling sewers and roads, rising teenage pregnancies, high school drmp-out rates of 80 per cent in some cities, worers marching in favour of medical insurance - all speak of a grimmer side of America. Offcal reports suggest that many middleclas Americans are struggling to maintain their standard of living. A Labour Department survey this week reported that the median income of US households has barely increased over the past two decades, mainly because of the slowdown in productivity. Many US families were only able to stay ahead by relying on two incomes. Over the next months, Democratic presidential candidates and congressio- nal leaders will seek to combine these themes in one stinging attack that Mr Bush's domestic \"agenda\" amounts to al talk, little action, and no money. The Democrats aim to make a virtue out of their party's weakness on for- eign policy. Its indecision on whether the US should go to war against Iraq still hurts - and will do so In the 19= elections. Also, its clamour igimres the constraints that Mr Bush faces as presi- dent when dealing with Democratic majorities in the House and the Samste. For all that, he does look vulnerable. Recognising the potential threat, the White House has organised trips to 10 states this month so that Mr Bush can counter-attack. His strategy is likely to fall to into two parts. First, the president will urge voters to look at the record of his three years in office. Some legislation - the rescue of the savings and loan industry, and parts of the banking reform bill - stemmed from pressing crises. How- ever, other initiatives, such as the Immigration bill and the landmark clean air act, were far bolder. Looking ahead to next year, Mr Bush will ocus on his proposals for crime (tough penalties on drua-related oences), transport (min ncreased highway fnds) and education. Echoing President Truman's attacks on the \"Do Nothing Congres\", in the IM9 prei- dential election, Mr Bush will try to blame the Democrats for stalling \"sound\" Republican plans. Mr Bush has a personal interest in education, working with state gover- nors on an ambitious programme to raise standards in schools by 2000. How- ever, this is all to be achieved through exhortation rather than money. Bolder Initiatives, such as home own- ership for the poor and preventive health care, are likely to be repckaged; but the thrust of Mr ush's approach remains as close as ever to President Reagan's. The aim is to continue to trim the scope of the federal govern- mndt and to devolve more responsiil- ity to the states. In haort the pideent Intends to play sae He has a sucesaiil vetoes b sice he took ice, so it is easy to see why he is tempted to continue an this tack - ven the nation's problems continue to proulrate.",

   "text_content" : "By Alexander Nicholl and David Housego in Bombay INDIAN PUBLIC sector companies may be invited to take stakes in nationalised banks as part of a much- needed recapitalisation pro- gramme, Mr S. Venkitarama- nan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said yesterday. Reforms of the financial sec- tor are being worked out by a high-level committee under the plans of the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to liberalise the econ- omy. The World Bank is dis- cussing a loan of up to $500m specifically to back reform of banks and other financial insti- tutions. Though privatisation of banks is expected to be part of its longer-term plans, the gov- ernment is currently ruling it out, and it would in any case be difficult given the banks' financial state. An improve- ment of their balance sheets and infusions of new capital are seen as essential. \"We need a substantial injec- tion of capital,\" the central bank chief said in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Venkitaramanan said a num- ber of potential means of boost- ing banks' capital were being considered. These included contributions of funds from the government, from state-run mutual funds, and employees. He has, however, suggested to the committee determining the reforms that \"successful public sector undertakings can hold capital in these companies because you cannot ignore the fact that they are some of the largest users of banking ser- vices in the country... this is genuine capital enhancement.\" Mr Venkitaramanan had in mind the close links between banks and industry in Japan. A foreign banker in Bombay yesterday welcomed this type of approach: \"If they can pull some of these things off, that is just what the banking sector needs.\" The central bank head par- ticularly drew attention to the methods used by France to improve the capital structure of state-owned banks, which he described as \"very ingenious financial engineering\". Bank profitability is limited by requirements to place 63 per cent of deposits with the cen- tral bank under statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios - to help fund the gov- ernment's deficit - as well as by bad loans and government- directed lending at below-mar- ket interest rates. Mr Venkitaramanan said the Indian authorities agreed that \"banks' profitability will depend on whether we can allow them more free play with their money and less pre-emp- tion for government require- ments.\" But reductions in the statutory liquidity ratios could not be considered until the sis- cal deficit began to fall. It is targeted at 6.5 per cent of GDP in the financial year ending next March compared with 9 per cent last year. The central bank would look more favourably at foreign banks' desires to expand their branch networks. The central bank head warned, however, that they would have to look outside the metropolitan areas. \"At the moment, they are mostly in the coastal areas, they are looking at the cream of Indian business. They have not really penetrated into the harder areas of India.",

Illinois also ordered Nomura Capi- tal to cease executing trades on its behalf through Nomura Securities, thus depriving the scandal-ridden firm of temmlission income. However, the fund will not withdraw the $130m Nomura Is already managing for it. Lat week, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the US' largest public pension find, also ordered Nommura Capital to cease exe- cuting oides throug its parent com- Mr Tabucht, who resigned over the scadals, gave testimony yesterday to a committee of the upper house o the Diet, which is holding hearings after similar sessions by a lower house committee last week. The committee also questioned representatives of Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities in an exhausting day-long examination broadcast i1ve. Mr Tabuchi, looking tired, in con- trast to his jaunty performance last week, denied that Nomura had broken the law on stock manipulation in its dealings in 198M in shares of Tokyu Corporation, a railway and property company. However, he admitted, as he has before, that the company went too far in promoting the stock. Nomura recommended the shares after Mr Susumu Ishil. the chief of a gangster orni ton who died this week, accumullted a lape holding, partly with Kunds borrwed frm am l ates of Nomura aind Nikko. Nikko has also admitted its links with Mr Ishii. Yesterday Mr Takuya Iwasaki, the former president, who also resigned over the scandals, admitted Nikko had dealt on Mr Ish- ii's behalf in buying a large block of shares in another company- Honshu Paper, a leading paper group. Honshu shares soared last year amid suspicions that a speculative syndicate was trying to corner the stock. Companies controlled by Mr Ishi subsequently emerged as large shareholders. Mr Tabuchi and his counterparts at the other Big Four brokerages also admitted yesterday that the publicly disclosed lists of compensation paid to clients to cover for trading losses were incomplete. About 20 brokers have disclosed payments made between October 1987 and March 1990. Yesterday the Big Four's represen- tatives confirmed that payments were made before October 1987 - the start- date for the published lists - and did not deny that payments may have been made after March 1990. The second date is more significant since in December 1989 the Ministry of Finance banned compensation pay- ments. Evidence that brokers had breached such a firm ministerial order could result in further punish- ment from the ministry. Paying com- pensation is not against the law unless it is preceded by a guarantee. Mr Tabuchi said payments made after March 1990 were now the subject of discussion between Nomura and the ministry. Mr Iwasaki, the former president of Nikko, Mr Masahiro Dozen, president of Daiwa, and Mr Tsugio Yukihira, president of Yam- aichi, also indicated the matter was under investigation. Mr Tabuchi said Nomura had decided to violate the 1989 order even though some executives had voiced concern. They went ahead in order to deal with another ministerial instruc- tion - a request to wind up eigyo tok- kin, investment trusts handled by bro- kers instead of fund managers.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Cameno in Jerusalem THE Israeli government yesterday set a budget deficit for 1992 significantly above the level recommended by the Finance Ministry and central bank, largely by accepting defence establishment objec- tions to a reduction in military spending. The debate was of more than usual significance as the gov- ernment's handling of the economy is under sharp scru- tiny by the US. Washington wants less state intervention and strong fiscal discipline and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, yesterday called for a delay in providing Israel with $10bn (Â£5.9bn) in housing loan guarantees to fund a wave of Soviet Jewish immigration while he seeks a breakthrough in Mideast peacemaking. A 17-hour cabinet debate ended early yesterday with a decision to alter substantially the draft budget presented by Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister. Instead of a Shklbn (Â£256m) cut in defence, which Mr Moda'i argued was needed to cover mmigration expendi- ture, ministers decided to up defence spending by at least Shk1OOm to over Shkl5bn out of total spending of Shk79.lbn. The budget deficit was inflated to the equivalent of 62 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 5.5 per cent contained in Mr Moda'i's draft. Although less than the expected outturn this year of 6.7 per cent, it is above the levels both the Treasury and the Bank of Israel have said are acceptable if inflation is to be controlled and sufficient growth generated to absorb the flow of Soviet immigrants. The projected deficit would have been even higher if minis- ters had not decided to lower the estimate of immigrants expected to arrive in 1992 to 200,000 from 250,000 by Mr Moda'il knocking Shk430m off planned spending. In the end, Mr Modal voted for the revised budget, which has to be passed by parliament later in the year. He said it was bearable. As part of the com- promise, he won ministerial commitment to introduce legis- lation enforcing the elimina- tion of the deficit by 1995. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel since last month, has argued repeatedly that this is vital if Israel is to succeed in winning the exter- nal funds needed for immi- grant absorption.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Sorter in Hong Kong CHINA is expected to release a Hong Kong businessman jailed for five years in March for allegedly trying to help Chi- nese dissidents escape the country. Mr Luo Hai Sing is likely to be freed this week after the British prime minis- ter, Mr John Major, raised the case with Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart. Mr Luo's conviction was widely seen as a politically- inspired warning to Hong Kong people not to get involved in China's internal affairs. Mr Luo and two other Hong Kong men were jailed for their part in the failed escape of Chen Ziming and Wang Jun- tao, who China accused of being \"black hand\" leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy move- ment in Tiananmen Square. Chen and Wang were subse- quently arrested and are now on hunger strike in Beijing, where they are serving long jail sentences. Mr Luo admitted he had car- ried messages between Hong Kong and China but always denied his charge of \"counter- revolutionary concealment\". Family members argued that the charge was unfair since Mr Luo had never met Chen or Wang so could not have con- cealed them. Mr Luo, 42, owned a trading company and frequently trav- elled to China. His wife has denied he was involved in the democracy movement. The convictions were also seen as an attempt to hit back at the Hong Kong Alliance for the support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China. The movement helped a number of prominent dissi- dents escape China through Hong Kong, by a route known as the \"underground railway\", after the Tiananmen Square killings. The movement has been outlawed by Beijing and its members branded \"subver- sive\". Mr John Kamm, a US busi- nessman in Hong Kong who has been working to free Mr Luo, said Mr Major's interven- tion speeded up the release. \"There is no question the Major visit played an impor- tant role,\" he said. Mr Major, speaking on his arrival in Hong Kong, said he would not discuss the case until Mr Luo was free. The decision to release Mr Luo was warmly welcomed in Hong Kong as evidence China is taking steps to improve its relationship with the colony. Relations started to improve earlier this year when Hong Kong people donated gener- ously to help victims of floods in China.",

Thailand delivered a draft concept paper to the other five Asean governments this week, according to officials attending a symposium in Singapore. The paper says a free trade zone would make the region more attractive to foreign investors, as well as increasing trade between the member states. It also sets out the tech- nical and regulatory changes required in areas such as pub- lic sector tendering, local con- tent requirements and tariff reductions.

   "text_content" : "HE danger that tougher regulations to protect the environment may be used as artificial barriers to international trade is under increasing attention in the run-up to the UN Conference on Environment and Develop- ment - the Earth Sum- mit - next June. There is concern too that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) could hamper the growth of international agreements to curb industrial pollution and counter global warming. In recent weeks, these prob- lems have come to the fore in discussions by officials from 150 countries in Geneva pre- paring for the summit in Rio de Janeiro. These talks ended yesterday with further discus- sions due in New York in March. \"The possibility of using environmental measures as a unilateral restraint on world trade is in my view a very dan- gerous and negative tendency,\" says Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian former businessman who is secretary-general of the conference. There is concern that indus- trialised countries could use strict \"green\" regulations as a pretext for banning imports from less-developed countries which cannot afford high stan- dards of environmental protec- tion. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) told the Geneva meeting that exports from developing coun- tries could be bit by environ- mental bariers. It called for a big increase in aid to these countries, including access to technology and support for benign environmental prac- tices. \"Without aropriate acen- tives to enhance the ellciency of resource use there is scant hope f achieving sustaInable =vlnnental conditions,\" it w-ms Unctad says xports of \"ood rom developig catrie ae likely to be affected by tighter rules on pesticide re- does and the se o chemical additives in food proceeslig in the developed wori.

The dispute between the US and Mexico over catching tuna fish shows how environmental concerns of a wealthy country can interfere with the economy of a poorer one. The US banned Mexican tuna imports on the grounds that fishing nets used also kill many dolphins. Mexico com- plained to Gatt that this was an unfair restraint on trade.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is urging the council of Gatt to overturn \"the narrow nterptation\" of the panel One WWPF policy analyst says the ruling could mean that national bans on imports of tropical Utimber could be deemed to violate Gatt rtules. t s hopd tht the Earth mmait wil agree an him tional convention to combat global warming.

A country whose industry has met these costs - \"inter- nalised\" them - would be enti- tled to impose a tariff against the product of the offending country or provide a counter- vailing subsidy to its own industry. The Canadian Environmen- tal Law Association says the terms of Gatt may accelerate environmental degradation and undermine national and international efforts to address ecological problems. \"The situation has grown worse in the past decade,\" it states. \"Trade agreements must incorporate environmen- tally sustainable economic deveoment as a fundamental goal. also must explicitly recognise the legitimacy of environmental protection ma- sures taken by nations.\" Gatt has no specific mecha- nism or programme for dealing with tr and environment.

   "text_content" : "By Steven Butler in Tokyo JAPAN's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said yes- terday it was planning to establish a joint public-private company next year to build a satellite research facility, which would include a space simulation chamber. The aim is to help Japanese companies develop testing facilities following the opening of the Japanese market to for- eign competition last year under US pressure. Foreign companies are widely seen as having a tech- nological lead and are expected to be well placed to win the next round of bidding for broadcast satellites, to be launched in 1996. Preliminary estimates for the cost of the facility are Y12bn (Â£52m). The ministry is planning to apply for funds from the gov- ernment's special account for industrial investment. It intends to invite NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and other Japanese companies to join the project, although some of the compa- nies said yesterday they had not been approached. Consideration is also being given to whether foreign com- panies would be invited to par- ticipate. Toshiba and Hitachi said that the development of satel- lites in Japan was currently inhibited by lack of appropri- ate testing facilities and that they would welcome such a project in principle. NEC said it would look favourably on any request to join. The project depended, however, on whether the min- istry was successful in its application to the Ministry of Finance for funding. * A North Korean group will launch a joint venture in Tokyo later this month, the first time a North Korean com- pany has done business directly in Japan, Renter reports from Tokyo.

   "text_content" : "I By Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor THE FOREIGN Office was \"strongly criticised\" yesterday. by the Commons public accounts committee for accounting errors resulting from failures of its computer system. The committee said it was alarmed at the catalogue of errors in the Foreign Office accounts and stressed that \"Inadequate controls\" had cre- ated a climate \"conducive to fraud and theft\". The strictures come seven months after a damning report by Mr John Bourn, the comp- troller and auditor-general, who said he was unable to complete a satisfactory audit of the Foreign Office's accounts for the year ending March 31 1990. He took the unusual step of \"qualifying\" his audit certifi- cates. The root of the accounting failures lay in the introduction of a computerised accounting system in 1969. Memory Com- puters had been chosen to pro- vide the software package but were unable to deliver it on time. The Foreign Office began running the old and new systems in parallel in Novem- ber 1989, more than a year later than planned. Even then, the new software still lacked the ability \"to produce output for reconciliation with the old system\". Memory went into liquida- tion early in 1990, and soon afterwards the Foreign Office's old computer broke down irreparably. It had to produce its 198-90 accounts on the new system, which had not been fully tested and contained pro- gramming errors that produced chaos in the records. The committee agreed with the admission from the Foreign Office that it had made a mis- take in believing it could man- age such a project on its own. The committee said: \"We are disturbed that they should have taken so long to recognise this and to adopt a better stan- dard of computer project man- agement.\" However it noted that, as a result of its pressure, the For- eign Office had negotiated a reduction of Â£40,000 in Price Waterhouse's Â£572,000 consul- tancy fees, in addition to a Â£42,000 reduction which had already been agreed. The For- eign Office had argued that it had no reason to blame Price Waterhouse for the accounting muddle which had occurred. While the accounting system was not working properly, the department's cashier stole Â£31,000, a sum which had since been recovered. The official concerned received a one-year suspended prison sentence and was dismissed. The committee expressed particular concern that the Foreign Office should have operated an ageing computer system without adequate back-up facilities and had allowed \"a complete turnover in bookkeeping staff\". It considered a continuity of experience on accounts work and the employment of a suffi- cient number of qualified per- sonnel to be essential.

   "text_content" : "Nest building: David Jones says that London Zoo is \"very much alive and kicking\" By Andrew Jack LONDON ZOO will break even and remain open next year by reducing its workforce by a third and its animal collection by up to 1,300, officials said yesterday. Three joint ventures are under discussion which could inject up to Â£40m into the Regent's Park site, while a public appeal has raised more than Â£2m since the government refused to provide further funding in April. Mr David Jones, general director, said overheads had been cut by 35 per cut through 40 voluntary redundancies and 50 compulsory ones. Up to 1,300 of the 8,000 animals housed in London will be sent to other zoos over the next few months. Visitors will see refurbish- ment over the coming year but are unlikely to notice changes in the collection, he said. \"We are very much alive and kick- ing, and expect the next season to be very attractive.\" Mr Jerry Tilston, organiser for the GMB general workers' union representing 17 employ- ees who are losing their jobs, criticised executives for reneg- ing on promises that redundan- cies would extend to senior positions. The zoo is discussing joint ventures with one North Amer- ican and two British consortia worth Â£15m-Â£40m. The Royal Zoological Society would retain control over animal husbandry in all the schemes. Under plans unveiled in June, London Zoo will become an animal conservation centre, with fewer animals but greater emphasis on displays to show the links between people, ani- mals and the environment."

Mr Harry Tuley, chairman of the regional council and group managing director of Scapa, the engineered fabrics and industrial textiles concern, admitted yesterday that the Channel tunnel will be of only limited value to the north because of road and rail prob- lems in getting goods to it and the tunnel's limited capacity. East coast ports had become increasingly important but east-west road congestion was worsening. Already 40 per cent of transpennine traffc was car- ried by the Mo, which runs between Liverpool and Hull.

Spending by tourists also fell 11 per cent to Â£635m in the first half. The continuing slump in vis- itor numbers was worse than expected by the tourist indus- try, which had looked for an upturn in the second quarter following the end of the Gulf war. Mr William Davis, chair- man of the British Tourist Authority, said yesterday: \"These figures show that the recession in many of our markets is lasting longer than predicted and American busi- liess in particular has not bounced back as quickly as expected.\" The number of visitors from north America has fallen by 29 per cent in the first six months of this year. Fewer UK residents also travelled abroad in the Janu- ary- to June period as resilt of the Gulf war and the British recession, with numbers falling 6 per cent to 3m. They spent 11 per cent less, at Â£985m, in the first half com- pared with the corresponding period last year. Mr Davis claimed yesterday that the numbers of tourists had recovered in July and August. \"Our view for the year is that overall the number of overseas visitors will hold up but tourism spend will be down,\" he said. \"We anticipate that the drop in the number of American visitors will be offset by strong business from Europe.\"",

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard .CUTS in mortgage interest rates were announced yester- day within hours of the latest half-point reduction in base rates. It was the fifth fall this year in the cost of home loans. Abbey National, the second- largest mortgage lender - with 1.3m accounts - was first off the mark. It cut its stan- dard mortgage interest rate by 0.4 percentage points from 11.95 per cent to 11.55 per cent. \"We were rather better pre- pared than other lenders, and a lot of people were taken by sur- prise,\" Abbey National said yesterday. The cuts have immediate effect for new borrowers and will apply to existing custom- ers in October, though the exact date has yet to be fixed. Abbey National's move meant that other lenders, who initially appeared inclined to wait in case base rates moved down a further 0.5 percentage points later this month, had lit- tle option but to follow. Halifax Building Society, the largest lender - with 1.7m bor- rowers - soon afterwards announced that it had under- cut Abbey National by trim- ming its basic mortgage rate by 0.45 percentage points to 11.5 per cent. The cuts come into effect immediately for new borrowers and from October for existing borrowers. Mortgage holders will save about Â£16.98 a month on the average endowment mortgage loan of Â£60,000, and Â£8.45 a month on endowment loans of Â£30,000. Other lenders are also set to reduce their mortgage interest rates, though not all of them were able to say yesterday how large the cuts would be.

Nationwide, the third-largest lender, said it would announce a reduction in its mortgage interest rates from today. Northern Rock Building Sod- ety said that it had cut its main mortgage rate to 11.5 per cent for new borrowers with immediate effect. Other large societies said that they were reviewing their rates. They are virtually certain to bring them into close align- ment with the level set by Hall- fax and Abbey National. The large clearing banks also look set to cut their rates in the next few days. Two of the Big Four, National Westminster and Lloyds, indicated that they were likely to announce a mortgage interest rate cut in the next two days. The two other Big Four banks, Barclays and Midland said yesterday that they were actively reviewing rates charged to mortgage borrow- as.",

   "text_content" : "\" will probably take months for yesterday's cut Sin UK interest rates to have any direct effect on the economy. But the half-point reduction in base rates to 10.5 per cent gave an instant boost to the nation's political pundits. The rate cut - the seventh half- point reduction this year - was quick to fuel speculation in the City as well as Westmin- ster that Mr John Major, the prime minister, is now prepar- ing for a November general election. The timing of the cut, com- ing shortly after a weekend opinion poll gave the Conser- vatives their first lead over Labour since the spring, stimu- lated the political antennae of City analysts, who in the main were caught on the hop by yes- terday's move. Coming on top of a percepti- ble improvement in business sentiment over the past month, a growing belief that the reces- sion has bottomed out and well-founded. expectations that the annual inflation rate will fall sharply over the next two months, they were quick to construct scenarios featuring Mr Major going to the country this autumn. The prime minister's high international profile of recent weeks has also strengthened the speculation. An autumn poll - with November 7 the most widely tipped date - must now be counted as a possibility. But Mr Major still has time to make up his mind. The period for final decisions on whether to call an election this year will probably be during the Conservative party conference early next month. October 11 has been pen- cllued in as a key date in many calendars. On that day, Mr Major will be rallying the faith- ful with his closing speech to the Tory conference, and the retail prices index for Septem- ber will be announced. That is widely expected to show infla- tion dropping to around 3.9 per cent. As there is an informal understanding that govern- ments do not ease monetary policy during general election campaigns, those two events could be the cue for a further base rate cut to 10 per cent, followed by a broad hint from the prime minister about an election and a decision to dis- solve parliament shortly after- wards. However, such scenario- building cut little ice with the Treasury or the Bank of England yesterday. They insisted that yesterday's cut was an economic decision. The Treasury said that it was \"right and prudent\" and con- u \"p UK banks' ba rate Per nt 50 45 40 35 30 Source: MORI Party popularity Per cent share sistent both with keeping ster- ling within its fluctuation bands in the European Mone- tary System and maintaining continued downward pressure on inflation. The Bank, in a rare statement, described the move as a \"measured response to the continuing decline in inflationary pressures.\" The Bank has in fact, been agreeably surprised by the eas- ing of inflationary pressures since the last base rate cut on July 12. The retail prices index for August, to be published at the end of next week, is expected to show a fall in the so-called headline inflation rate to around 4.6 per cent from July's 5.5 per cent. Further declines in the annual rate of RPI infla- tion to little more than 3 per cent in October must be on the cards following yesterday's mortgage rate cuts. More important for the Bank has been the steady monthly decline in average earnings growth to 8% per cent in June this year from last July's peak of 10% per cent and the fact that this has increasingly reflected moderation in pay settlements. This trend has gone a long way towards eas- ing earlier fears that underly- ing inflation could prove a problem in Britain. The view in Threadneedle Street is that inflation will be on the way down for some time. But even if base rates are cut to 10 per cent in the fore- seeable future, the Bank sees no risk that such a monetary easing will engender excess demand over the over the next 12 months or so. In opting for a half-point cut, the authorities yesterday made clear that they do not believe the economy requires a \"kick- start\" as demanded by indus- trial lobbies such as the Con- federation of British Industry and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce during the summer. According to Mr Steven Bell, chief economist of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, it is likely that the economy will resume growth during the cur- rent quarter, thus marking the formal end of the recession. There are already encouraging straws in the wind. The provi- sional retail sales for July showed a small rise rather than the expected decline, August car sales have been better than expected while industrial production is set to rise in the quarter, thanks to increased oil output. A further factor influencing yesterday's decision was the state of the financial markets. Sterling opened steady yes- terday, in spite of speculation on Tuesday in the domestic money market that an early cut in rates might be on the cards. When the cut was announced, it had little effect on the pound. The Bank of England was therefore able to signal a rate cut without any qualms. Although the move came faster than was expected by many mainstream economists in the City, the Bank of England clearly felt that it was moving with the grain of the markets. Since the end of last week, the key three-month interbank rate had begun to move down towards the new base-rate level of 10.5 per cent. The scope for a significant further downward movement in UK interest rates will be limited by the need to main- tain sterling within its ERM bands. The differential between comparable UK and German interest rates has shrunk to fewer than 1.5 percentage points from around 7 points since last October, when Britain announced it was entering the ERM, and base rates were first cut by one point from 15 per cent. Overall, the 4.5 point decline in UK bank base rates during the past 11 months represents a substantial easing of UK monetary policy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, must now be hop- ing that the cumulative effect of the rate cuts will soon have a more perceptible effect on the economy.",

   "text_content" : "By Juliet Sychrava NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned nuclear company, yesterday signed a Â£13bn con- tract with British Nuclear Fuels to buy and reprocess nuclear fuel. The long-awaited contract, described yesterday as one of the largest ever signed, was hammered out over more than a year. It replaces existing con- tracts between BNFL and Nuclear Electric, as well as agreements dating from the days of the Central Electricity Generating Board. As expected, it commits Nuclear Electric to reprocess- ing all the spent fuel - about 12,000 tonnes - from its older Magnox reactors. More unexpectedly, Nuclear Electric agreed to reprocess about two thirds of the fuel used during the lifetime of its advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) - about 3,000 tonnes, or 15 years' worth of fuel. After that, Nuclear Electric can opt not to reprocess but to store its AGR fuel, as its sister company Scottish Nuclear hopes to do. Mr John Collier, chairman of. Nuclear Electric, yesterday vig- orously defended his decislorn to opt for reprocessing AGR fuel. \"I am no supporter of reprocessing per se except in as far as it provides [the] lowest- cost option,\" he said. Nuclear Electric did not dis- pute Scottish Nuclear studies indicating on-site storage of nuclear fuel to be substantially cheaper than reprocessing. Nuclear Electric insisted, how- ever, that the package offered by BNFL was still cheaper. One reason for this may be that, unlike Scottish Nuclear, Nuclear Electric has Magnox fuel which can only be repro- cessed, not stored. That makes it easier for BNFL to negotiate a total package for Magnox and AGR fuel. Nuclear Electric's commitment to reprocessing AGR fuel runs to about the time when the Magnox reac- tors are due to be retired. Sir Christopher Harding, chairman of BNFL, said the contract constituted a commit- ment to reprocessing by Nuclear Electric which would help BNFL win more contracts abroad, notably in Japan.",

   "text_content" : "Juliet Sychrava on prospects for power projects seekingaid from a levy on the price of electricity . TIUJDSREDS of wind farms, sewage: farms and rubbish dumps could soon win gvernment backing io generate electricity, f increasing public and indus- trial pressure is successful. Friday was the deadline for these and other renewable- encrgy projects to apgly sorN government aid under the Non- Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), which tubsidises nuclear. and renewable energy through a levy 'n the price'of electricity/ Last year, only 75 renewable- eqergy projects totalling 102MW - equivalent to about a third of the outptitof a small coal-fired power station - were accepted for NFFO sup- port. A much larger number applied. Only about 2 per cent of the annual NFFO levy pays for renewables, while the rest goes towards nuclear energy. The environmental group Green- peace calculates that support for renewables last year totalled about Â£2m, or about 40p per household per year, compared with Â£17 per house- hold per year for nuclear power. Yesterday, Greenpeace launched a campaign calling on the government to aim for generation of about 10 per cent of electricity consumption - around 6,000MW - from renewables by the year 2000. The government's target is for 2 per cent or 1,000MW by 2000. The Greenpeace estimate comes hot on the heels of a survey from the envireon ental group Friends of the Eafth which called for 3,500MW b 2000: In July, the Bow Group, a Conservative pressure group,. proposed a target of 2,000MW. The Association of Indepen- dent Electricity Producers (AIEP) is soon to produce a cri- tique of the NFFO, which will ask for higher targets for renewables. A report due shortly from the Commons energy select committee is also expected to call for more sup- port for renewables. Mr Colin Moynihan, the energy minister responsible for renewables, will begin next week to hear evidence for a strategy review of renewables. \"There is pressure from the public, the industry, from the electricity generators, from the Bow Group,\" said Mr Stewart Boyle, energy policy director of Greenpeace, yesterday. \"It is only the government that is holding back.\" About 250MW of wind power projects alone are understood to have applied for this year's scheme. The main applicants include National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generator; the Wind Energy Group, owned by Taylor Woodrow and British Aerospace; and Ecogen, the reiewable energy consultancy and4 developers. La-ndfill schemes, which con- vert methane from waste to energy, have also been among the larger projects. The lobbyists' main criticism of the NFFO is that the govern-. ment has failed to set challeng- ing targets for renewable energy. Another is that the NFFO will expire in 1998.. So this year's renewable projects, which are often very capital-in- tensive, must be financed, over seven years rather than the 15 typical for a conventional power station. Renewable-energy producers must charge more per unit of renewable energy to recover costs during that period. M ost wind-power appli- cants to the NFFO rely on being subsi- dised enough to charge 8p to lo0p per unit for their electric- ity, compared with the 2p to 3p pool or spot market price, because wind power is capital- intensive. If they could finance their projects over 15.years, the price could fall to 3.5p per unit. Another problem with the 1998 deadline is that projects delayed by a hitch in obtaining planning permission can quickly become uncommercial, in spite of their long-term potential.. The 1998 deadline was set by Brussels, but the EC has made clear that it would be eceptive to an appeal for an extesion. Mr Boyle said yesterday he believed the government had accepted the need for change. \"They know the NFFO is not going well, and with an elec- tion coming up they know that a lot of the applicants wanting to start schemes are their natu- ral supporters - small busi- nessmen.\" It is not yet clear how many schemes the govern- ment will support. Projects bid in tranches, according to whether they are wind, hydro, landfill gas or other schemes. It is expected projects will be accepted from the cheapest upwards within each band, until the desired megawattage is achieved. A \"strike price\" would then be set, which would be paid to all projects in the tranche. But the government could still bow to pressure and accept all the projects, which are expected to bid within a very close range. \"We think there's a high pos- sibility they'll accept the majority of the proposals,\" Mr Michael Harper, Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner said yesterday. \"It will be very hard for them to resist.\" He added that renewables repre- sent such a small fraction of the total non-fossil fuel levy that accepting every scheme would not be a burden. ,Â·Â·~r, Â·:- i ::: -Â·,Â·~Â·FÂ·Â· Â·Â·:Â·:'~~Â·:ij jÂ· 1 3.,.

   "text_content" : "A DEAL to placate 22 Scottish renewable-energy producers excluded from the Department of Energy's renewable-energy support scheme was rejected as \"disappointing\" yesterday by the Association of Independent Electricity Producers (AIEP), Juliet Sychrava writes. In May, the Scottish Office proposed a deal to the 22 pro- ducers who were excluded from the Non-Fossil Fuel Obli- gation (NFFO) scheme under which they could sell a total of 58 gigawatt hours of electricity to the two Scottish generators, Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro Electric, at 5.3p per unit, compared with the 1.9p they had typically received before. Contracts from the two gen- erators had proved unsatisfac- tory, said Mr David Porter, chairman of the AIEP, yester- day. \"We were led to believe in meetings with the Scottish Office that our members would be offered 5.3p for at least 70 per cent of their capacity,\" he said. Instead, it has turned out that most producers concerned are getting 4.3p per unit when the contract price is averaged over their total production. Speaking at the launch of a Greenpeace renewable energy campaign yesterday, Mr Steve Andrews, adviser to the AIEP, said producers had been disap- pointed by the Scottish Office offer, details of which the pro- ducers had received early this week. This disappointment will deepen the AIEP's resolve to take legal action against the Department of Energy on behalf of the 22 producers. Mr Andrews said the Scot- tish Office had underestimated the total amount of generating capacity that would qualify for the scheme by about 50 per cent, and so it had had to spread the money more thinly. Yesterday the Scottish Office said the deal was consistent with its announcement in May.",

   "text_content" : "By MiOnhal Smih, Labour Correspondent BRITAIN could raise an extra Â£2bn each year by asking exist- ing tax inspectors to spend more time on forcing busi- nesses to comply with their legal tax obligations, Congress heard yesterday. Ms Elizabeth Symons gener- al-secretary of the PDA Civil Service union, said the savings could be achieved without an increase in the number of tax inspectors. It could mean Ip off the income tax rate, she said. Congress agreed to press the government to ensure that tax- collecting departments raise the emphasis given to tax com- pliance, avoidance and evasion among businesses. It also wants to increase the resources available for such work. Ms Symons drew attention to disparities in investigations into social security claims and business tax avoidance. Last year the Department of Social Security launched 300,000 investigations, but there were only 100,000 probes by the Inland Revenue. Whereas the DSS investiga- tions produced Â£500m, the fig- ure for the Inland Revenue was six times higher. Tax inspectors in the FDA have calculated that if the pro- portion of their time spent on business compliance increased from 70 per cent to 80 per cent, the total raised would increase from Â£3.6bn this year to Â£5.6bn. The Congress motion said the government should attempt to increase the tax yield significarftly without increasing the burden on hon- est tax payers. -Today's debates CONGRESS this morning debates public services, energy policy, financial services, local government, transport and the environment. This afternoon Congress debates broadcasting, international issues, relations between unions and TUC finances."

The TUC claims that without its proposals - the cost of which would be between Â£2bn and Â£5bn - unemployment would reach 3m at the end of next year and average 2.8m for the whole year.

Ms Diana Warwick, general- secretary of the AUT, com- plained that government statis- tics no longer paint a true pic- ture. She said the Department Of Employment estimate of employees in manufacturing is routinely wrong by 500,000 and the retail prices index figures are distorted by failing to track 50 per cent of prices. Poor sta- tistics were inefficient, she said, citing a case where the government computer that handles index-linked benefits miscalculated the RPI at a cost of Â£5m. \"We need as a matter of urgency to see the creation of an independent Statistical Advisory Council.\"",

   "text_content" : "YESTERDAY'S unemployment debate was revealing not so much for what was said, but for how it was said and who said it. The two best speakers were plummy graduates, Diana Warwick and Elizabeth Symons; other contributors included a bank manager, a probation officer and a head- master. It was rational, sensible and utterly dull. It was left to the ex-Communist Jimmy Airlie, one of the few delegates with experience of addressing mass meetings of manual workers, to inject some passion. But the manual workers, and the \"Im all right Jack\" trade union leader caricatures, are disappearing. Nearly a quarter of the 54 members of the TUC general council are now gradu- ates and an increasing number of them are \"round the bend , meaning they have been sit- ting around the council's table long enough to have left the beginaers' section and turned one of the table's commrs. Congress has long since ceased to be a workingclas gathering, but frustrated modernisers still complain that it remains culturally out of step with Britain's in- 'ur NOTEBOOK By David Goodhart creasingly classless workforce. Many graduates have made. it to the top only by pretending that they are not graduates. The cultural tone of many unions is still set by middle- ranking full-time officidals who have changed far less than their members. The applause for Jimmy Air- lie, proably the loudest of the day, suggests many delegates still prefer a good, old-fash- ioned rant from \"one of our own kind\" to the polite argu- ments of the new middle-class trade union bureaucrats. According to one general- secretary, union leaders can now be divided into three goups. First are the new techno- crats such as Diana Warwick of the Association of Univer- sity 'dihers, who is young, politically pragmatic and unimpressed by the totems of the movement. People like her are usually confined to smaller professional unions, where they are not required to have come up through the ranks. The second group is the old gang from the big manual unions such as Jimmy Knapp of the RMT rail and shipping union. Many of them are able men but they have little expe- rience of the world outside their unions and have got where they are because of Bug- gins' turn or political patron- age. By the time they reach the top they are usually exhausted. The third and most interest- ing group is embodied by John Edmonds of the GMB general union and several leading offi- cials from the TUC centre itself. Edmonds is a new tech- nocrat by background - public school and first-class degree from Oxford - but has climbed his way up an old-fashioned manual union. The multi-chinned Edmonds is, at least among leaders of the bigger unions, a refresh- ingly intelligent and progres- sive leader. Probably for that reason he is also the most unpopular at the TUC.",

But hi combaive approach to' e uis hon as nonetheless la(C some effect in Glasgow. Today Congress will reaffirm ite'support for the Bridlington - Areenenit, even though many union leaders regard it as long .ovrdiue for reform. A motion 'calling for a review of the agreement will not be tabled because unions fear the use Mr Howard would make of the debate. The Bridlington Agreement - drawn up at the TUC Con- gress in Bridlington, Humber- side, in 1939 - regulates com- petition between unions. Unions are forbidden to recruit members in industries, plants or occupational groups where other unions have traditionally represented workers. If a dis- pute arises between two unions, it is referred to the TUC for binding arbitration. From time to time, the appli- cation of Bridlington rules leads to headline-catching dis- putes. For example, the TGWU general union threatened Balpa, the airline pilots' union, with Bridlington in 1989 for offering a haven to British Air- ways cabin staff who wished to leave the TGWU. Concerted strain on Bridling- ton started after the arrival of Japanese and other overseas companies investing in plants in the UK in the early 1980s. Some invited unions to tender for the sole right to represent all the workforce, even where the Bridlington principles would have given the rights to several unions. The EETPU electricians' union was expelled from the TUC in 1988 for refusing to accept Bridlington rulings that it should give up members gained in two disputed single- union deals. The EETPU argued that the members involved should ballot on which union they wanted.

Some invited unions to tender for the sole right to represent all the workforce, even where the Bridlington principles would have given the rights to several unions. The EETPU electricians' union was expelled from the TUC in 1988 for refusing to accept Bridlinon rulings that it should give up members gained in two disputed single- union deals. The EETPU argued that the members involved should ballot on which union they wanted. The freedom that being out- side the Bridlngton framework gave the electricians was dem- onstrated earlier this year Empire building: unions such as the GMB have been warned against recruiting construction workers who belong to Ucatt when the building workers' union Ucatt appeared likely to disintegrate. TUC-affiliated unions such as the GMB were warned against recruiting Ucatt members, leaving the field to the non-TUC EETPU. \"Bridlington does not cope in a situation where a union is disintegrating and where an expelled union could gain an advantage,\" Mr John Edmonds, GMB general-secretary, said at the time. Other union leaders worried in private about the future of Bridlington after the EETPU's expulsion. Several believe the Bridlington frame- work is now inadequate. The AEU engineering union has long advocated a stronger role for the TUC to simplify bar- gaining arrangements in estab- lished plants. That might include pushing unions to negotiate together - the \"sin- gle table\" approach - or even helping to establish single- union deals. Mr Bill Morris, who has been chosen to be the next general- secretary of the TGWU, has said the Bridlington arrange- ments are \"ripe for reform\". Early this summer there seemed to be growing support for a wide-ranging inquiry into Bridlington. But the talk was abruptly halted in July when Mr Howard published a green paper that proposed preventing unions from refusing member- ship to people who. wished to join them. There were some exceptions: a nursing union, for example, would be able to refuse mem- bership to a plumber. But for- mal deals like Bridlington carving out spheres of influ- ence would be barred. Mr Howard larded his green paper liberally with quotes from union leaders that appeared to justify reforms. It is this which has led to cold feet at the TUC. First, the TUC's employment committee opted for a limited review of how Bridlington is working rather than a funda- mental inquiry. Then pressure was put on the Engineers' and Managers' Association (EMA) to withdraw a motion tabled for this week's Congress. The motion pointed out that assigning spheres of influence to unions is incom- patible with the TUC's growing desire for a statutory right of recognition. The EMA argues that if employees are entitled to force their employer to recognise the union of their choice, the TUC can hardly come along and insist that they belong to a different union. Whatever the logic of the EMA argument, other union leaders wanted to avoid a debate in the full glare of Con- gress. They thought publicity would only provide further ammunition for Mr Howard. The motion is to be remitted for consideration by the gen- eral council without debate, and Congress is likely to endorse the retention of Brid- lington principles unchanged. TUC leaders accept that a fundamental review of Brid- lington cannot be avoided for ever. The review will be sooner if a Labour government is elected and the threat to any form of regulating competition is removed. But until then, there will be considerable resistance to any further pub- lic debate which might aid the government.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Adonis CONFLICT between teachers' unions over pay determination looks set to spread to the TUC today as the National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, presses Congress to dis- own the new review body for teachers' pay. The other five teachers' unions and other public-sector unions have indicated support for pay review bodies. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT gen- eral-secretary, will argue that review bodies undermine union negotiating rights and breach guarantees of collective bargaining in International Labour Organisation (ILO) con- ventions. Legislation for the pay review body was enacted earlier this summer. The body is supported by the Labour party and will start work shortly. Mr McAvoy intends to use a motion supporting ILO conventions as a mandate for the TUC general council to ask the ILO to condemn the teach- ers' pay review body. \"The removal of negotiating rights for teachers is the same as the withdrawal of trade union rights at GCHQ [the gov- ernment's intelligence-gather- ing centre at Cheltenham],\" Mr McAvoy said yesterday. The claim was dismissed by Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general- secretary of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union affiliated to the TUC. The Association of Univer- sity Teachers has also called for a pay review body to replace existing bargaining arrangements. Mr Hector MacKenzie, gener- al-secretary of the Cohse health service union, said: \"It will cause a row. Pay review serves us far better than so-called free collective bar- gaining.\" * The government yesterday offered clinical academic staff a pay rise of 8.4 per cent for 1991-92, in line with the increase offered to doctors in the National Health Service. However, the Association of University Teachers criticised the offer, saying it appeared to backtrack on the government's previous insistence that there would be no new money for academics beyond a 6 per cent offer made in March.",

That was mainly because most of the unions did not have specific procedures for dealing with race discrimina- tion complaints, according to the surVey. The study of black workers' involvement in unions was undertaken by Northern Col- lege and Ruskin College. A report based on the study will be published next year with recommendations for action including ethnic moni- toring. Mr Bob Fryer, principal of Northern College, said unions had begun to address the con- cerns of black people about a decade ago. But he said: \"There is an element of prog- ress but black workers want to see more progress more quickly.\" According to the study: * Black members did not feel that unions were sufficiently involved in actions regarding race discrimination and harassment. * None of the unions were able to provide detailed infor- mation on the number of mem- bers they supported through grievance procedures or indus- trial tribunals. * Black members were reluc- tant to come forward with complaints to their unions.",

   "text_content" : "By Ariane Geonllard A round Prague's cobblestoned streets, where old orange trams sometimes screech to a halt to let pedestri- ans cross as they gaze up at the city's numerous gargoyles, the 20th century seems almost forgotten. It won't be so for long. Later this month 70 of the city's trams will wear the col- ours of Marlboro and Camel cigarette packets. Every inch of the trams' surfaces are being painted at the moment to achieve what will resemble huge metal cigarette packets on wheels. This advertising coup de force is the result of a recent contract signed between Czech- point International, a consul- tancy with offices in London and Prague, and Rencar, the Czech agency in charge of advertising for the city's public transport. Under the agreement, 75 per cent of all advertising rights for space on buses, trams, shel- ters and in the subway have been granted to Czechpoint International. The remaining 25 per cent of the space is available to local advertisers. Transport Display Interna- tional, the US m karketg com- pany which has exclusive advertising rights for buses in 50 US cities and has recently expanded its markets to include Budapest and Moscow, has subcontracted from Czech- point International the entire space on 70 of Prague's 350 trams for RJR Reynolds and Philip Morris for one year. With Brussels drafting legis- lation which could ban tobacco advertising virtually every- where except inside tobac- conists, tobacco companies regard eastern Europe as one of their biggest potential growth areas. Restriction on tobacco or alcohol advertising will take time to arrive there. Neither health lobbies, which are prac- tically non-existent, nor city planners seem to have a say in the type and amount of adver- tising taking over eastern Europe. In Prague alone, advertising has sprung up in.the oddest laces. The entiee fiade 'of a building overlooking the his, toric Wenceslas Square, where Soviet tanks rolled in during the 1958 invasion, is today painted with an advertisement for the detergent, Persl. The prodt is currently produced by .the Slovak firm, Palma, under a licensing agreement with Hankel, of Germany. A few streets away, bill- boards overwhelm in size and colour some of the most beauti- ful houses in Prpgue which have become embassies after being confiscated when the communists came to power. \"Advertising was almost non-existent under the old regime. The few existing adver- tisements were often purpose- less. You'd see, let's say, a bill- board showing a milk bottle with a bit of political ideology written next to it in the middle of a park. So with our newly- gained freedom, people think they can do it just anywhere or in any way they please,\" explains Jiri Bohal, director of Merkur, one of the largest advertising firms in Prague, which recently signed a Joint veture greement with the US firm, DMBB. Theoretically, advertisers are supposed to seek approval from the city's Main Offce of Architects, which then submits the proposals to the state- owned company overseeing all buildings in Prague. \"In reality, there is a woman sitting behind a growing pile of demands, not knowing what to do with them,\" admits Franti- sek Polak, Prague's deputy mayor. Furious to learn that trams will be painted like cigarette packets, he quickly scribbles in his notebook the names of Ren- car and Transport Display International. \"There are simply no laws to tell people what is permissible. Moreover, all censorship was abolished. No-one is going to dare tell anyone now what can or cannot be said or shown in an advertisement,\" adds Jan Fiedler, adviser to the deputy mayor. \"While the entire tram is painted, it does not show the whole packet of cigarettes,\" ; parriesEllot Ritten d, nun, aging director of TDL \"This is purely pushing brand aware- iess, itis not usage-driven,\" he adds. But while the European Community goes on debating if \\ -cigarette advertsig s ul- advised, Cahoslovak televi sion does not hesitate to show 1 somewhat more inducing images. . \"After the revolution, adver- tisers would flash a naked woman on the screen to catch viewers' attention. Then, you would see the office furniture you were meant to buy. But the market took care of that method. There.were so many naked bodies, no differentia- tion was possible any longer. Advertisers gradually stopped doing it,\" explains Vaclav Sen- Juk, who heads his own adver- tising agency in Prague. Local advertising firms are finding it difficult to compete with the ways of western cor- porate advertisers finding their way around Prague. Capitalist dointlon: advwring corne to Wncelas Square In Prague .-? F Â·\"\"Â·~''., Striving new companies have little money to devote to advertising, adds Senjuk, and in the large existing ones, which enjoy relatively unthrea. tened monopolies, the need for advertising Is not yet felt. Western companies moving into eastern Europe turn to their traditional advertising agencies which have been quick to establish joint ven- tures locally. Very active among them is Young & Rubi- cam which, at the beginning of the year, signed an agreement with Jiri Kratena, one-time employee of Centrum, a large agency under the former regime. Last year Kratena designed the television campaign for the locally-produced Lanza deter- gent. A shirtless Pavarotti- looking actor sung the famous aria, \"Sole mio\" as \"Lanza mio\" while a huge Lanza deter- gent box rose majestically in the background. Young & Rubicam has also been handling the campaign for the electronics company, Minolta, which has adopted the colour pink to promote its brand. While Minolta tradition- ally concentrates on posters, often just showing the Minolta logo against a pink backdrop, it has also painted one tram m each of the cities of Brno and Bratislava. The tram in Bratislava which shines like a blown-out piece of bubble-gum, is cer- tainly hard to forget. \"People love it or hate it but they sure remember it,\" con- firms Kratena.",

Mutet Awsseme Pubhoi ra, 600 - -U T he sedate world of the opti- cian has recently seen great upheavals and the market for optical products seems set for yet more substantial changes. For decades optometrists in the UK have prided themselves on their expertise in offering a professional healthcare service and have handed down their practices from genera- tion to generation. But over the past few years opti- cians have suffered a series of jolts which forced an estimated 350 out of 5,500 out of business in the 20 months to the end of 1990.The lift- ing of restrictions in 1984 on who could sell spectacles let in the first chill breeze of competition. Following the severe slump in eye sight examinations and optical product sales that resulted from the abolition of universal free testing in April 1989, opticians have looked out onto a new marketplace where demand has to be actively created rather than passively satisfied. Mar- keting skills are at a premium. One company which has added a novel dimension to the optical mar- ket is Lenscrafters, an aggressively marketed US business which first set up in the UK just over a year ago. It has since opened eight shops - six in London and two in Wales. \"We think the UK market can handle 50 to 70 stores. Our game plan is to get them up and running in the next two to three years,\" says Gus McPhie, managing director of Lenscrafters' operations in the UK, whose background is in marketing fast moving consumer goods. Lenscrafters believes it offers cus- tomers two distinct propositions. First, McPhie says: \"We see our- selves as a super-optical store with a laboratory on the premises that is capable of delivering a pair of glasses for 95 per cent of customers in about an hour.\" Second, the company offers a wide selection of frames: 3,0004,000 compared with the 300400 available in a traditional optician's outlet In contrast to the downbeat talk of UK businesses, McPhie talks enthusiastically about expanding the market, believing it is currently underdeveloped. He points to the opportunities for offering fashion glasses and encour- aging customers to buy several frames. \"Fundamentally we have tried to employ consumer goods marketing techniques in the optical industry, including a lot of media advertising and promotions. The press adver- tisements include coupons for free eye sight tests,\" he says. Lenscrafters sites its stores in expensive high street locations where its costs can only be covered by higher sales. \"We have to generate a lot more customer traffic compared with a company that does not have super- optical elements. We firmly believe that if we can get people into our stores we can satisfy them,\" he says. But the Lenscrafters' approach has its doubters. Some of the inde- pendents have not welcomed the arrival of the super-optician concept believing that such stores are more interested in retailing and making good returns on their substantial investments than sustaining a rig- orous healthcare service. Others have-also expressed their doubts about its marketing appeal. Bertie Pinchera, managing director of Boots' opticians chain, which runs about 300 outlets, says: \"Len- scrafters has come over here with an American philosophy that speed of service is the primary require- ment. \"But we do not see it quite like that. The one-hour service is only attractive to those people who need it. Some people may much rather come back the next day.\" The independents have also begun to shape up to the new mar- ket conditions. The Association of Optometrists has been running pro- sessional marketing courses for its members since 1984 when advertis- ing by practices was permitted after the restrictions on the sale of read- ing glasses were lifted. \"When advertising rules were relaxed there was quite a lot of press advertising but it was not found to be a terribly effective way to attract new business. \"People by and large do not choose a practitioner on that basis. They take a serious *iew of their eye care,\" says Ian Hunter, the asso- ciation's secretary. The association has also encour- aged greater public relations and individual practices have experi- mented with direct mail shots and providing informational leaflets. He sees the multiples taking increasing market share from the independents. \"The traditional mix in this country has been 50:50 between the independents and the multiples. But this is likely to change in my view. Unless the inde- pendents are able to respond we will see a big change in how eye care is delivered in the country in the next decade,\" he says.",

   "text_content" : "JUNGLE FEVER (18) Empire CLOSE MY EYES (18) Camdep Plam , 4Chela OSCAR (PG) Cama.s West Ead TETSUO: THE IRON MAN 08) ICA has a sense of humour. Have you noticed how often seemingly obsolete devices suddenly bound back into everyday use? Like con- doms. Or democracy in Eastern Europe. In today's cinema black-and-white films are back; or movies scarcely less two-tone than those of the pre- Technicolor heyday. In this week's Jungle Fever, blacks mix it with whites as part of the ethnic meltdown currently amazing modern cinema. Poised between detente and Armageddon, new pictures like Eoyz N The Hood, A Rage In Harlem, New Jack City and Jungle Fever hurl black charac- ters at the camera as if we have never seen them before. And perhaps we haven't, at least in the numbers we are seeing now and in human-rath- er-than-Hollywoodised form. Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, like his Do The Right Thing, is a bustling tragicomedy about the racial divide. As the surre- alist road-sign titles suggest - aerially weaving above New York to the pounding of Stevie Wonder's title song - a film- goer needs to be a traffic cop to co-ordinate this many charac- ters. Middle-class black archi- tect Wesley Snipes is married to light-black beauty Lonette McKee but has a side-order adultery with white work col- league Annabella Sciorra: this to the horror of Snipes's black pal Spike Lee (\"H-Bomb! - nuclear megaton bomb!\") and to the grief of Sciorra's Italian boyfriend John Turturro (resembling a turnip in shock) who keeps getting an ear-bash- ing from racist Dad Anthony Quinn. Meanwhile Snipes's crack-ad- dict brother Samuel L. Jackson (Cannes Best Supporting Actor) is sliding to ruin while his Reverend Dad Ossie Davis is trying to slide up to Heaven; preferably without his chil- dren. I know how much can be absorbed over your morning Grape Nuts and you have been patient. The marvel is that act- or-writer-director Lee keeps his interconnected plots lucid and mettlesome. Around the hurri cane-eye of the main romance whirl the bewildered gossipy scorn of Miss McKee and her Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman in Stephen Pollakofs 'Close My Eyes' all-black hen parties, surgically dissecting the hypocrisies and contradictions of black-white sexual attraction, and the franker passions of the Italian quarter. Mr Quinn is a dhlight. He seizes the emotional spot- light whether raging with rac- ism (\"You f- a nigger!\") or shaking a headful of white hairs at black supremacism. \"They took our sports - base- ball, football. What's left?\" \"Golf?\" suggests his son. The film is about stereotypes and the way we live with them. We jump to the glibbest con- clusion about other people and other races and then wonder why they never behave as we expect them to. When a little girl makes a daft misconstruc- tion about human behaviour - \"Daddy, why're you always hurting Mummy?\" pipes Snipes's 5-year-old in scene one after a noisy bedroom session from her parents - the audi- ence chuckles condescend- ingly. When grown-ups miscon- strue, suggests Lee, few people either chuckle or even recog- nise. Made with the sly, surg- ing wit of a Brueghel painting, Jungle Fver is a large, teem- ing, masterly human satire. Mention of semi-obsolete_ obects that leap back into use- fulness brings us to Stephen Poliakoff. Who would have believed that the playwright- filmmaker who gave us Run- ners, Hidden City and She Went Away, three state-of-Britain whinges that we wished would go away, was the creator-in- waiting of Close My Spes? This is a comedy about incest, adultery and, yes, the state of Britain. But it is as far from being a whinge as Rawal- pindi is from Rickmansworth. Which brings us to Alan Rick- man. As the rich, blas6 hus- band of Saskia Reeves, who is embarking on a guilty affair with her brother Clive Owen, Rickman is dazzling. Whether languidly teasing his wife, slyly testing his rival or flor- idly discounting his own Renaissance brilliance - \"rm one of those boring people who've read all of Proust in French\" - this actor is a force of nurture whose like we have not seen since... well, why limit? Whose like we have not seen. Rickman is a film-stealer, but he meets his match here. Close My Eyes is burglar- proofed with its own brilliance. Poliakoff uses his sibling-incest plot as a prism through which, with like pangs of inbred long- ing, we watch the slow-ruining beauty of beloved Britain. Rickman and Owen, speculator and planning watchdog respec- tively, link destinies over lunches and business chats .and Docklands walking tours as well over Miss Reeve. Since the story is set in 1985, ..the enterprise culture creates a halo of optimism even around the lovers. They shuttle between country picnics and London lovemakings as if Thatcher's Britain were an eternal Brideshead eternally revisitable. Without its wit and incan- descent acting, the film might have been another Poliakoff lecture. But it's a sign of his cinematic growing-up that there are no \"withouts.\" Close My Eyes is a cunning, radiant fable about love's wilful blind- ness: love of girl or man, love of brother or sister, love of a country where enterprise can means ruin as much as renewal, and where social mobility means rises for some and vertiginous falls-from- grace for others. Nigel Andrews The only thing funny about John Landis's Oscar is that it was made in the first place. As if the notion of this least subtle of directors doing a 1930s screwball-style comedy weren't absurd enough, he also gives us Sylvester Stallone in the leading role. The result is a frantic film which is utterly devoid of humour. Stallone plays Angelo \"Snaps\" Provolone, a Prohibi- tionera bootlegger who prom- ises his dying father that he will mend his crooked ways. He meets serious resistance from colleagues and family, however, who have all grown used to his criminal largesse. To make things worse, the police continue to hound him, rival gangsters Aon't trust him and the legitimate bankers he's trying to join are ripping him off. And, worse still, his daugh- ter announces that she and Oscar the chauffeur are going to have a baby. Now, this is not a bad prem- ise for a comedy at all - one can imagine the sort of fun Preston Sturges would have had with it. Landis is from a different school of comic direc- tion altogether, however, his style spanning the short gap between the gross-out humour ot Animal House and the big budlet burlesque of the The -Blues : Biothers. .H.simple doesn't have the right touch for the sort of knowing banter and split-second timing needed to make a screwball comedy woakt Writers Jim Muiholland and Michael Barrie are no help, providing a script thin on wit and thick with oi6ntless plot. Stallone labours hero- ically, but suffers from the .small drawback of not being funny, at least not when he's supposed to be. The rest of the cast follow his lead, with even such usually reliable actors a Peter Riegert, Harry Shearer and Tim Curry giving perfor- mances as wooden as a boot- legger's cask. You find yourself wishing the actors in Tetsuow The Hron Man were a bit more wooden. This strange and violent Japa- nese film about a businessman who begins to turn to metal after a hit and run accident is the cinematic equivalent of having your eyes welded open. The opening scene has a metal fetishist graphically inserting an Lron rod into his thigh, after which things get progressively nastier. While the film's theme of post-Industrial man turning into the stuff of machines has a certain validity, director Shinya Tsukamoto overworks it with a molten flood of har- rowing imagery. The scene where our hero's penis turns into a massive power drill which he uses to menace his girlfriend would be unwatcha- ble if it weren't so bizarrely inventive. Strictly for those who found David Lynch's Ems- erhead to be thin gruel. * Frank Capra, who died yester- day at the age of 94, was fortu- nate that the world was col- lapsing around him just as he hit the prime of his career. The Great Depression served as the backdrop for his great films, allowing such brilliantly popu- list, brazenly sentimental work as It Happened One Night (1934), Mr Smith Goes to Wash- ington (1939), and Meet John Doe (1941) to strike accord with a weary public. Although his films often focused on the underdog, the tone was unabashedly hopeful. This rosy focus was out of place in the post-war years, when anxieties became more complex. Indeed, his only memorable film of that time, It's a Wonderful Life (1946), could have been made 10 years earlier. Capra was that rarest of directors, who could perfectly capture his era while at the same time allow- ing his audience to forget about it for a couple of hours. Stephen Amidon",

   "text_content" : "The open-air serenade concerts at the Lion Monument have long been a sea- ture of this festival. The site is delight- ful - a grove of trees by a small sheet of water backed by a sounding-board of scored rock into which is carved, after a relief by Thorwaldsen, the figure of a wounded lion. The stillness has a calm- ing effect on the audience. A few leaves may rustle but nobody moves. The con- certs (of one hour's duration) have been closely associated with Paul Sacher, veteran conductor, generous and enter- prising Maecenas, an \"esprit anima- teur\" if ever there was one. For the first serenade this year (repeated the next evening) Sacher and the Collegium Musicum from Zurich nodded at Mozart with the Kleine Nacht- musik and with trumpet concertos by Wolfgang's father Leopold and Haydn's brother Michael The soloist, Haakon Hardenberger, woke the birds to (unsuccessful) rivalry with his shining phrases, more liquid than ever under the open sky. Sacher's rococo is sedate, untouched as yet by the freshed-up speeds of younger interpreters. At the outset he challenged our ears with the almost inaudible opening murmurs of Schoeck's Sommemacht (1945) a \"pastoral intermezzo\" for string orchestra, a silverpoint nocturne filled with subdued scurryings over which stray faint echoes of distant dance music. One of the big symphony concerts is labelled in the programme - without explanation - as a \"gala for a new mcocert hall\". Lucerne needs one. But since the site of the Kunsthas, fidng the lake, close to railway station and town centre, is too good to lose, a thorough overhaul of the acoustics might be the best solution. This is surely of paramount importance when, as many appear to think, the festival's main attraction is the array of famous visiting orchestras and star conductors. 1991 brings the Philharmonics of Berlin, Vienna and Israel, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and, many others including the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. I caught the Israel Philharmonic with Zubin Mehta conducting Mahler's Fifth Symphony, and a beefy hard-driving performance it was. All the lines thickened, leaving a minimum of inward probing, little distinction and less delicacy. The distant Alpine vistas failed to open up - one could not help noticing this in a city where the real thing lies so close. Any amount of hot tone. The Israeli strings glowed in sustained passages, but they glowed viscously. In the Adagletto the harp notes were like bubbles struggling upwards through condensed milk. What one heard was not an accurate impression, surely, of this eminent orchestra. All audience eyes were on the adored Mehta, prancing and curvetting on the podium. Endless applause and recalls, a mite prolonged perhaps by the attendants' disinclination to open the doors until the last possible moment. Full marks to the ventilation at the Kunsthaus. On two swelteringly humid evenings the hall was as cool as cucumber. Ronald Crichton"

   "text_content" : "THE lYVHUitlE One sensed last week that London's West End was looking up with the production of Ibsen's Brand at the Ald. wych. Here was a serious play, newly translated and reason- ably well done. Brand seems only a signpost, however, com- pared with iedd Gobler at the Playhouse. 'This is the Irish approach to Ibsen. You might even say that it is the Irish translation, for not only are the accents Irish, the impression is that the play might well have been set in Ireland in the first place. Above all, the Irish, not famed for doing things on time, do it fast. The Abbey Theatre's produc- tion has alrqady been praised on its first appearance in Dub. lin earlier this summer. In Lon- don it should be a revelation. Seldom in the last year or two have I seen an audience so hooked, wrapped up not only in the plot, which has its twists, but in every single nuance. First tribute must be paid to Fiona Shaw as Hedda. Anyone who has ever thought that this is an unsympathetic part to play now has the answer. She is a complex, but recognisable character: a married woman who is attractive and intelli- gent, bqt bored and poor.Jane Austen would have recognised her immediately. Ms Shaw's Hedda is neither unutterably selfish nor incapable of remorse. She is a round charac- ter who thinks, feels and devel- ops on stage. She conveys her boredom without hmposing it. Yet Ms Shaw would presum- ably be the first to admit that this is not g one-woman perfor- mance. The triumph lies in the production. At thfinal curtain I was slightly surprised to be reminded that thete are only seven people in it, so much had one been caught up in a soci- ety without any feeling of claustrophobia. The direction by Deborah Warner is precisely what it should be: namely, direct. It concentrates on a few simple ideas and a few simple points. Take, for example, the case of the hat. Hedda complains in the first act, and later admits that she did it to be cruel, that Aunt Jules has been uncivil- ised in leaving a hat in the drawing room. Thereafter there is a social problem when- ever a hat has to be taken off and put somewhere. This is largely not spoken, only hinted at. In the second act attention shifts to the placing of the manuscript, around which much of the plot revolves. The manucript Is a kind of substi- tute for a child and is finally burnt. Again Ms Warner's direction does not overdo it. Bestriding the hats and the manuscripts are the pistols which appear in both acts. They are not seen too much, but you never forget their criti- cal, sinister presence in the background. In the end, of course, they are lethal, not once but twice. One of the most shocking lines is the news that E)lert has been killed by a shot not in the head or the chest, but in the stom- ach where Hedda had placed it. It is like the killing of a child, but Ms Warner does not dwell on it. Her direction lets the action and the text speak for themselves. When the occa- sional act of physical violence takes place, like Jorgen sud- denly going for Hedda, it comes with a shudder of genu- ine surprise. None of that would be possi- ble without the speed with which it is performed. Some sequences indeed would be intolerable with the customary English pauses. That is the Irish lesson.

   "text_content" : "We missed the last 15 minutes or so of Wuthering Heights (Old Fire Station, Oxford) because the last train to London is now scheduled to run back to Lon- don remarkably early. Most people would probably prefer to do without the first 15 min- utes where the show is slow to take shape. In the intervening couple of hours, however, it is clear that something rather ambitious is trying to get out. This Wuthering Heights is misleadingly billed as a musi- cal. Although there is more than a touch of Sondheim in it, it is much closer to Benjamin Britten than it is to even the cleverest of musicals. It is an opera in all but name. The composer is Martin Yates and practically all the (very experi- enced) performers have more of a background in music than in the straight theatre. So far, it is only partially successful. One of the difficul- ties lies in the epic nature of Emily Bronte's epic novel There must be doubts whether it can be done with only two pianos and no other instru- -ments, though it is still a pretty bold attempt. It is also plain, at least from this produc- tion, that not all the characters lend themselves as easily to operatic treatment as others. There is a big question mark over Hindley Earnshaw who emerges more as a straight lout than any kind of tragic figure. Yet there is no doubt about Cathy as sung and .played by Fiona O'Neill. Ms O'Neill has voice, pathos, trag- edy and some wonderful facial expressions. One would not dream of making a final judgment of a production still in its experi- mental stages, even though the company has willingly exposed it to the critics. It is enough to say that the Old Fire Station in Oxford has emerged as a very exciting place. Here is small theatre, backed by Cameron Mackintosh, carrying experi- mentation with musical thea- tre to its sensible limits. If Stephen Tate, the director, can find a more certain start and delete some spitting that mars the first few minutes, this pro- duction might well take off. Meanwhile, anyone who wants to see why the English musical needs new dimensions might like to look at Good Goly Miss Molly (Arts Theatre, landon), which has arrived after break- ing box-office records at New- castle-under-Lyme. The piece is at least unpre- tentious. It says it draws on nostalgia for the 1950s and '60s, and that is what it does. There is a local pop group, part of which since made good. The old stars are called upon to back a campaign to prevent a housing estate being redevel- oped by the council. The first line is \"It's a bit bloody loud\", and that's true as well. We move from Dean Martin's greatest hit (\"Memories are Made of This\") to \"This Old House\" and, inevitably in the circumstances, \"We Shall Not Be Moved\". The politics are a bit nostalgic, too. \"Support the miners: the Heath Government must go\", someone says lim- ply. Then on to Mrs Thatcher: \"First Argentina, now the NUM!\" Of course, the protes- tors win. Nostalgia is pre- served. Although I do not trust first night audiences in Lon- don, the show, written and directed by Bob Eaton, seemed to be very popular. The whole cast, with Sarah Mortimer as Miss Molly, is a terrific bunch of troupers. Malcolm Rutherford"

   "text_content" : "WAA IIOUSE, cROfDONl The tango: there's a lot of it about. T. Argentino recently closed, T. at the End of Winter recently opened, and now Lip- stick T. The tango is a dance of sex. (All that foreplay and energy with the feet; and those interlocked pelvises.) And it is morbid. The rhythm, the mood, the words deal with death; fate; oppression; cruelty; obses- sion; etc. Tango Argentino knew that, and kept developing it as a thrilling, glamorous and witty stage world. In Buster Theatre's new Lip- stick Tango, however, the tango is just a heavy symbol that punctuates proceedings. The five players enact an array of situations so fragmented as to- be largely incomprehensible; 'buat, once I bad given up trying o make bead or tail of how one scene connected with another, it became evident to me that they baoiled down to th same nexus of sex, erotic obsession, irony and death. Irony is developed by having actors continually swapping between two roles each, by having them comment on their own situations in prolonged asides, and by presentihg sev- eral scenes as if they were being rehearsed for a Radio Buenos Aires afternoon play called Lipstick lTango. For example... While a man makes love to a woman on a table, she dictates a Dear Agony Aunt letter about the two men in her life. The man leaves, and the woman switches gear into a third-per- son-singular narration of the situation of a second woman onstage. Then this second woman tells us her story, which seems wholly unrelated, in the first person singular. Then the two woman converse; and their dialogue is on yet another wavelength. Confus- ing, yes. Rewarding, no. Everyone is inside and out- side their situations at the same time. Some situations recur in different ways. None of this makes what's what any clearer. On one level (narrative), Lip- stick Tango is wholly baffling. On another (content), though, it's pretty obvious. The tango: where men are callous, where the women are wronged, and where both sexes seem perpet- ually on heat. This view of life seems to me at best narrow; and it belittles the tango too. (The dancing is not bad, but no tango is allowed to reach its own conclusion.) Katie Campbell and the director Sarah Harper have concocted Lipstick Tlano from the novels of Manuel Puig; and the worst thing I can say about it is that it has put me off reading them.

   "text_content" : "THE TREASURY claims that the half point cut in the base rate announced yesterday was \"right and prudent\". This adds little to public knowledge. Even though glasnost may have triumphed in the rapidly disappearing Soviet empire, the Treasury is unlikely to announce that an interest rate cut is both wrong and impru- dent. But sometimes they are, particularly when elections loom close. Fortunately for the UK, this is not one of those times. With growing evidence of declining inflationary pres- sures, continued doubt about the likely strength of any eco- nomic recovery and real short term rates of interest - even after yesterday's cut - at 4-5 per cent, the domestic case for lower rates of interest has remained strong. At the same time, sterling is still close to its central rate of DM2.95. Not only that, but it remained sta- ble yesterday, suggesting once again that its position remains invulnerable to the rapidly diminishing interest rate differ- ential vis-d-vis the D-Mark. The ability of the UK author- ities to reduce the short-term interest rate differential while keeping sterling close to its central rate against the D-Mark has been both the most remarkable and the most encouraging feature of experi- ence since sterling was put into the ERM last October. The gap between base rate and the German Lombard rate has fallen by almost 5% percentage points over the past year; the gap on three-month money has shrunk by 5% percentage points; and both are now down to 1% percentage points. That this has happened without a depreciation suggests a consid- erable increase in confidence in sterling's short-term stabil- ity. Striking convergence At first glance, the conver- gence of long-term interest rates seems less remarkable. Last September, five year gilts had a redemption yield of just over 12 per cent, while that on comparable German bonds was 9 per cent. Now the redemption yield on the German securities is still close to 9 per cent, but that on gilts is down to just over 10 per cent. A year ago, therefore, bond markets suggested that the exchange rate against the D-Mark would be about DM2.50 five years hence. Now they suggest it will be not far below DM2.80. Here too the change is remarkable. The principal economic ques- tion for the longer term is whether this improvement in longer-term expectations can be made to stick. That will depend, in turn, on whether the UK manages to achieve internationally competitive levels of inflation as well as sustained economic growth. This achievement - something that has escaped the UK for more than a generation - is far from secure. Without still lower rates of wage inflation, it will remain insecure. Chief question Meanwhile, the economic and political question for the short term is how much room exists for lower rates of inter- est. At the longer end, the opportunity must be small, unless German long-term rates of interest themselves fall sharply. Nothing in this week's announcement of German sis- cal policy suggests that this will happen soon, although a determined Bundesbank might yet bring it about. Since the way the Bundes- bank would do this is by using high short-term rates of inter- est to tip the German economy into recession, prospects for short-term rates of interest in the UK would then be decid- edly gloomy. But even if Ger- man short-term rates were to go no higher, Norman Lam- ont's room for manoeuvre would be small. Another half a percentage point cut in base rate seems likely; another one percentage point possible. But to go still further would be a remarkable - though not an inconceivable - success. The futures market is not that opti- mistic. It suggests that short-term rates of interest will be only another half a percent- age point lower next June. By cutting now, the chancel- lor of the exchequer suggests his confidence that there is another shot or two in the locker before an election even if that is called in the autumn. For once such pre-election cal- culations do at least not make disastrous economics. That is the one silver lining in the recessionary cloud."

   "text_content" : "THE SHARP 3 per cent improvement in the monthly index of the US purchasing managers (NAPM) - the key indicator of industrial senti- ment - seems to provide strong confirmation of other recent recovery signals. It is the seventh successive monthly rise in the index, and follows a record jump in dura- ble goods orders in July, unex- pected strength in retail sales, in the official leading indicator, and in construction activity. Yet the response to this good news is tentative, to say the least. The equity market is drifting and the dollar is posi- tioned for a further cut in interest rates. Some of the more bearish market analysts are even suggesting that the whole recovery is a statistical illusion, based on faulty sea- sonal adjustment. This is scarcely plausible, but there are quite strong reasons to question the strength and stay- ing power of the recovery. The strongest is the contin- ued weakness in final demand. Consumer sentiment remains weak, and real incomes have recently been falling; car sales have turned anaemic again after the beginning of an apparent surge. Retail chains - except for those known for the lowest prices - still report disappointing saimes. There are bright spots in industrial plant, black holes in commercial building and defence equipment, difficulties in the computer and airline industries, and deep recession in the old boom area of the north-at and Califorania, bal- anced by continud recovery in the moncedepreemd rust belt. The only unequivocal source of growth, however, is export orders. At a real annual growth rate of less than 5 per cent, these are hardly strong enough to float the whole econ- omy, as they did when they were rising nearly four times as hst in IM-lB.. uv-lofy cycle At this stage, in short, it ppeurs that the US is eujoyug not a brad re ry, but wht we wae repuatdly ta was Ipalbleft - thupe de am favenuiey cyde. gaoM aijsetres wo-aM d pIaI = of- s Ir* afid role in the business cycle; but not for the first time, analysts seem to have over-dramatised a slow technical change. The motor industry, especially, entered the recession drasti- cally over-stocked; indeed even its improved third-quarter pro- duction plans are still being held below the rate of sales. Continued rundown This means that for the moment, we are seeing not so much an inventory-led recov- ery as a relaxation in earlier efforts to run down excess stocks - a rather negative sort of recovery. This picture is confirmed even in the bullish NAPM survey, which shows that despite higher orders, manufacturers intend to cut inventories further. This is hardly a picture of strong underlying confidence; and the employment scene is much the same, with continued rundown planned (though this is normal at this early stage in a recov- ery). Reported comments from industrialists underline the point: they are enjoying stron- ger orders at the moment, but waiting for confirmation of the trend before they think of hir- ing any more wrkers. Finally, the undoubted, if still tentative, recovery in manufacturing must be set against the weakest picture in the service economy for more than two decades. Service income and employment have underpinned demand even in the depths of the recessions of the 1970 and 1980; but now, for the first time, service employment is actually shrink- ito& Ns only by a littl.

   "text_content" : "from smoked chimsanzee brains to crocodile'claws. But as prices spWil and the econ- omy heads into a deepening crisis, Mr Mobutu's image among his impoverished people is increasingly tarnished. Mr Mobutu is cornered, on two sides: first, he has been abandoned by his traditional western allies - the US and Belgium, the former colonial power - which have become embarrassed at the president's human rights abuses. Second, he is confronted by the eco- nomic legacy of years of mis- management and embezzle- ment. Mr Mobutu is rapidly losing his grip on the country he has ruled as a personal fief- dom for 26 years. Hyperinflation, devaluation of the currency by 80 per cent since the beginning of this year, uncontrolled government expenditure, an unserviceable $9bn-$10bn external debt and hand-to-mouth economic poli- cy-making have together cre- ated a bedrock of mass support for pro-democracy opposition groups, legalised by the presi- dent under pressure in April last year. Attempts by the Mouvement Populaire de la Revolution (MPR) - the ruling party - to manipulate and dis- tort a national round-table con- ference on Zaire's political and constitutional future have exacerbated tensions. The con- ference was to have been held last spring but the MPR delayed its start three times. Its future looks uncertain. Demonstrations, strikes and riots this year revealed the potential for confrontation between the democrats and the president. Tensions intensified this week as at least one per- son was killed in demonstra- tions in Kinshasa and govern- ment offices were closed by a civil service-led strike. Discon- tent has spread into the poorly paid armed forces and senior members of the ruling party are deserting the president in droves. \"A year ago, after his speech, Mobutu had the ability to man- age the transition to democ- racy and still remain as presi- dent,\" said one Zairean who until last year was among Mr Mobutu's closest advisers. \"Now he is finished. Nobody believes the president any more.\" Leaders of opposition parties fear an explosion. \"If the presi- dent continues to stop the march towards democracy there could be violence either from the side of the army or from the masses who are fed up and want change,\" said Mr Jean Nguz a Karl-I-Bond, presi- dent of the Union of Federal- ists and Independent Republi- cans (UFERI), one of the five main opposition groups. \"That could lead to mass bloodshed and civil war.\" The regional implications of that kind of eruption in Africa's second largest coun- try, which sits at the heart of the continent, borders 11 other states and has a population of 35m, are of mounting concern to western diplomats in Kins- hasa, the capital. Since seizing power in a mili- tary coup in 1965, Mr Mobutu, SZAIRE RWA Kinshasa BUR then a 35-year-old lieutenant- general, has weathered inva- sions and secessionist rebel- lions, coup attempts and eco- nomic crises. He has shown a remarkable ability to win over and co-opt his most vocal oppo- nents and hold together a country five times the size of France with more than 200 eth- nic groups. He has shrewdly manipulated the west in gen- eral and the US in particular into supporting his dictator- ship as a necessary bastion of anti-communism in the region. For years the west turned a blind eye to Mr Mobutu's viola- tions of human rights and his corruption, granting loans on a non-commercial basis and giv- ing military assistance to his government as the price for stability in central Africa. The west also used Zaire as a con- duit for arms to the right-wing Unita rebels fighting the Sovi- et-backed government in neigh- bouring Angola. Now, following criticism by Belgium of the shooting of at least 78 students in Lubum- bashi last year, all economic ties with Brussels have been severed. The US administra- tion, under pressure from Con- gress, has also cut off military assistance and wound down economic aid; with this year's Angolan peace settlement, it has no further geopolitical interest in shoring up Mr Mob- utu. At home, Mr Mobutu, once known to his people as \"the guide\" and \"the all-powerful warrior\", is now openly insulted as a \"thief' and \"dic- tator\". Zaire's free-wheeling and proliferating newspapers carry cartoons of Mr Mobutu in his trademark leopard-skin hat portraying him as a frenzied maniac trying to blow up the country. The symbols of his once pow- erful personality cult - the lapel badges with his portrait and Mao-style attire - have been dumped. \"Mobutu always based his power on a myth of power which instilled fear,\" said Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, president of the main opposi- tion Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS). \"Now Mobutu is demystified and nobody is afraid any more. He has no credibility. Everybody wants change. It is over.\" Mr Mobutu has not encour- aged confidence by taking up residence on a refurbished Bel- gian colonial riverboat, appar- ently on the strict advice of a marabout - a traditional spiri- tual guide. The boat, fitted out with luxurious banquet rooms and a helicopter pad, is usually moored at Nsele, 40km from Kinshasa and within striking distance of the Congo. In the capital, the continued stalling and manoeuvring over the national conference has created growing tension. The leading opposition parties and hundreds of non-aligned dele- gates have boycotted the con- ference, alleging the MPR was packing the conference hall with bogus delegates and mem- bers of the security forces. \"We are determined to get the con- ference we need to have real political change,\" said Mr Mar- cel Lihau, a former detainee and leader of the UDPS. \"If Irobutu refuse to accept this .we will bing the country to a halt\" This week's strike call marks the start of a campaign of more direct action. And while most opposition flguresare reluctant to call for fulscale street pro- tets which they will be unable to control, continued economic disintegration could aggravate the uprest. It is estimated that inflation will have topped an annual rate of 1,500 per cent by the end of this year. Prices for basic commodities like rice and cassava are rising daily and many Zaireans have seen their purchasing power eroded by more than 80 per cent in real terms in the past five months. Inflation is also being driven by excessive government spending, particularly on wages. Billions of zaires were printed to finance a budget def- icit estimated to. be headed towards 11 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Declining foreign exchange earnings from falling produc- tion of copper, the country's number one export earner, combined with a sharp cut in foreign assistance, has com- pounded the crisis. The govern- ment has also failed to pay back at least $400m of its $9bn-$10bn external debt to western creditors. Mr Mobutu is personally blamed for much of the ecc nomic crisis which has turned one of Africa's potentially rich- est countries, with large depos- its of copper, cobalt, tin, gold and diamonds and vast tracts of arable land into one of Africa's poorest countries. Nationalisation and grandiose projects in the 1970s, combined with rising fuel costs and declining prices for copper, first knocked the economy off track in 1973-74 after a decade of 5-6 per cent growth a year. Repeated efforts at economic reform have been half-hearted. Last year the World Bank and international Monetary Fund suspended their support for a structural adjustment pro- gramme which aimed to cut the budget deficit by reducing government expenditure; boost exports and instil fiscal disci- pline; liberalise the exchange rate; reallocate priorities to investment in infrastructure. Per capita income has declined sharply from $360 in 1985 to 200 a year in 1990. The one constant in the economy has been corruption and conspicu- Dus consumption. Billions of dollars of foreign exchange have been diverted rom state companies to per- sonal bank accounts abroad. Over-priced contracts have been awarded to politically connected businessmen. Secret shipments of cobalt and dia- ionds have been smuggled out )f the country.

The young man promptly revealed himself as the owner of an export company in Scotland. Business was desperate, he declared, \"because the British economy is in such a mess, and has been so badly managed.\" Whereupon a UK diplomat in attendance on the party snootily asked Petri junior if he knew whom he was talking to. \"Yes sir,\" came the answer, \"but I cannot tell a He.\" As the Tuscan George Washington retharned to the kitchen, Lament was seen thoughtfily pouring himself another glass of wine.",

   "text_content" : "isten to the voice of Ben Hamper, auto factory worker extraordinaire, as he describes the slow men- tal disintegration of a col- league on the assembly line: \"The nights roiled on. I'd lean across from the guy and watch the sweat pour off his chin. And, somewhere in this factory town, I could see his wife curled up on a sofabed await- ing the return of her reclaimed assembly man. \"It wasn't hard to visualise just how she might shudder when the door flew open each night and in trudged this chewed-up mutation of a foot- ball star who, once upon a time, looked awful drooly pas- tin' petals on the prom float, but now, staring back at her from the other side of the meat grinder, resembled nothing more than a heap of defeat with the limbs attached.\" Rivethead, Hamper's auto- biographical account of his nine years on the assembly line at a General Motors plant at Flint, Michigan, establishes him as an unusual individual - a blue-collar worker with powerful literary abilities, able to communicate the dreadful tedium of his job in vivid and entertaining prose. Hamper is already a minor celebrity in the US, thanks to a column, entitled \"Impressions of a Rivethead\", which he used to write in an alternative Michigan newspaper. The paper was edited by Michael Moore, Hamper's literary men- tor, who went on to direct \"Roger and Me\", an extremely funny but profoundly one-sided documentary film attacking GM for closing many of its Flint plants. Hamper's book is also extremely funny - although the humour repeatedly descends into sniggering puer- ility - and it is extremely one-sided. It portrays GM's management as remote and incompetent, while the assem- bly line is a haze of drink, drugs, rock'n'roll and work avoidance scams. Literary exposes of the drudgery of factory life are hardly new. But most have been written either by middle- class voyeurs or members of the working class who have got education and got out. As a result, they have tended to invest the toiling masses with an unreal, saccharine nobility. This is quite lacking in Riv- ethead. Hamper is a genuine, beer-swilling, work-shy mem- ber of a family which has pro- vided GM with three genera- tions of factory fodder. His swagger is irritating, his lan- guage is often crude, and his world view is little broader than the bottom of a beerglass. But he is a good storyteller. He never intended to join GM. He set his mind firmly against it at the age of seven when he first entered an auto factory and watched his father at work, installing wind- screens. \"We stood there for 40 minutes or so, a miniature life- time, and the pattern never RIVETHEAD: TALES FROM THE ASSEMBLY LINE By Ben Hamper Warner Books $19.95 234 pages changed. Car, windshield. Car, windshield. Drudgery piled atop drudgery. Cigarette to cig- arette. Decades rolling through the rafters...\" But Hamper son never had the energy to find an alterna- tive career and instead took up his birthright as a GM \"sho- prat\", or factory worker, where he learnt to cope with the prob- lem afflicting all those on the assembly line: how to kill time. The clock, he writes, \"sucked on you as you awaited the next job. It ridiculed you each time you'd take a peek. The more irritated you became the slower it moved. The slower it moved, the more you thought. Thinking was a very slow death at times.\" Tactics to kill time included boozing, chain-smoking, practi- cal jokes, spitting contests and races to the water-fountain. Hamper found he was so underemployed in most of his jobs that he could handle a col- league's work as well. Carried to its ultimate refinement, this -scam allowed both men to cut their working day in half. This is one of many indict- ments of GM's management methods. Hamper also main- tains that, for all their fine words, senior officials rarely appeared on the plant floor. He describes some hilariously wrong-headed attempts to improve quality, including the creation of a plant mascot, a huge cat with the unsubtle name of Howie Makem, which used to prowl the plant floor and get pelted with rivets for its troubles. But then Hamper himself was hardly a model company man. His view of GM's periodic pep talks: \"Why would any of us give a shit about the specif- ics of the great master plan? We knew what holes our screws went in. That was truth enough. Point us towards our air guns and welders and drill presses and save all the partic- ulars for the antheads in the smocks and bifocals.\" Much has changed in the US motor industry since Hamper left it five years ago. Detroit has started to embrace the more efficient, and usually more humane, \"lean\" produc- tion methods pioneered by the Japanese. But the assembly line is still central to motor manufactur- ing around the world, and so too is its dehumanising effect on the workforce. In the end, it even got to the self-assured Hamper, or perhaps it was all that booze: he was invalided out of GM in 1986 after a series of panic attacks. He is still in psychotherapy and still taking medication as he tries to make a living as a writer. Martin Dickson",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Andrew Phillips. Sir, When I saw your leader (\"Death of the god that failed\", September 2) I thought your admirable breadth of interest had embraced the most ignored and elusive aspect of our own cultural predicament. I was disappointed. Your analysis was a re-run of the cosy view now dominant in the west, namely that the collapse of Bolshevism represents, as your subsidiary headline put it, \"capitalism's triumph\". If that is true in one sense, it is untrue in others. The amor- ality of which you rightly con- vict Soviet communism is increasingly a feature of inter- national capitalism, particu- larly in the financial sector (as current headlines should remind us). Furthermore, the key to the relative success of our own lib- eral democracy was that it used not to get the cart before the horse. It was rooted in the belief that an economy is the fruit of a culture, rather than the reverse. It is hard to imag- ine the next Conservative man- ifesto, for example, being couched in terms of the party's 1949 policy statement which trumpeted \"the inability of purely materialist philosophies to read the riddle of life and achieve the necessary subordi- nation of economic progress to the needs of the human spirit\". We do indeed have some grounds for proper pride (though it increasingly comes across as smugness) in the face of the happenings behind the old Iron Curtain. However, the other face of our reality is that the seeds of the slow degrada- tion of our own culture are already bearing their deadly fruit, and unless we reinvest heavily in the wellsprings of the moral values of our whole society - including the eco- nomic expression of it - you will need to rewrite your edito- rial sooner than you think.

   "text_content" : "Fom Mr DPMcErlain. Sir, Your article on the Bank of England's call for disclosure of fees to merger advisers (Sep- tember 3) was of great interest to me in view of Anglo Unit- ed's successful bid in August 1989 for Coalite. In our bid Anglo, with a market capitalls- ation of about 2S0m, borrowed almost Â£500m to win one of the largest leveraged bids mounted in the UK. It did not need a genius to know that the fees paid to our advisers were suc- cemssrelated wherever possible. My view was (and still remains) that the fees are of absolutely no interest to the target compny but potlally argu3nme from theii and fancial logic of our bid in favour of attacks on our adviser reward structure. We have been encouraged to reward success at all levels and ifan adviser Ia prepared to accept a contingent fee then it is good for all parties in the event of either success or fail- ure of a bid. As far a our shareholders were concerned I was able to say that the costs of the bid were not going to affect Anglo in the event of failure, a vital point when asking sharehold- era to increase borrowing pow- ers to Â£C500 So who loses? The Coalite shareholder gained materially from our bid, and our own shareholders have seen their company grow substantially. All the advisers retained by us during the bid are still with us. I believe the the system of adis- closure at the time of the bid should be left enactly as it is. Please let as not hinder take- overs and the willngness of an adviser to shre risk. DPMcdIrla.

   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Samuel Brittan I14 writing about a period as long and complex as the British economy in the Thatcher period the first need is to tell what occurred in a coherent framework, so it Is ntst event after event. Thus the first thing I di. when I received Christopher Johnson's book on the sub- ject1, was to look at the charts and tables. My initial reaction was enthusiastic. In their com- prehensiveness and articula- tion they far outshine those, for instance, in Andrew Brit- ton's weightier book2 which I discussed in Economic View- noint on July 27. Yet Johnson's book is one-fifth the price. It was compiled just before the author stopped being chief eco- nomic adviser to Lloyds Bank. The political conclusions also start waell. Even Mrs Thatcher's energies were not sufficient to replace the \"judg- ment and action of which capa- ble ministers were deprived by the quasi-presidential rule of 10 Downing Street... When the game was going well she took most of the credit, but when it was going badly the offending player was dropped from the team\". But beyond these easy points, his touch begins to fal- ter. He criticises the prime minister for overruling her chancellor, Nigel Lawson, on the ERM and the poll tax, but says that she should have over- ruled him on \"monetary con- trol\" - which quite wrongly assumes that she personally wanted a tighter monetary pol- icy than her chancellor did. Looking further into the book, my cheers became still more muffled. For although written from the same centrist point of view as Britton's, the latter's account is far clearer on the key analytical issues. Johnson's greatest weakness is what he takes to be his strong point: his reliance on the reports of the House of Com- mons Treasury Committee which he advised. \"It would be tedious if not improper,\" he writes, \"for me to specify which of the quotes was a direct result of my advice\" (nudge, nudge). While the committee has performed a great service in eliciting official explanations and analyses which could never have been delivered on the floor of the House, its own attempts to make strictures which MPs of different parties could sign, have been highly obscurantist. Instead of critici- sing chancellors for relying too much - despite their disclaim- ers - on Treasury forecasts, the committee wants to give them an even larger place. A key recent recommendation is that there should be four pub- lished official forecasts per annum instead of two: an inno- vation which the British econ- HOWE PRIOR TEBBIT LAWSON KING YOUNG IN I LEY PATTEN FOWLER omy needs like four bullet holes in its own head. The committee has stuck to the post-war Crippsian view of the balance of payments prob- lem. It has gone with the herd in banging the drum for manu- Johnson's greatest weakness is his reliance on the Treasury Committee which he advised facturing instead of educating political opinion in the equal marginal value of all sectors under a proper pricing system. Johnson, like the committee, thinks the government erred in not making more use of short-term variations in fiscal policy, although as Sir Geoff- rey Howe rightly remarked in his first Budget speech, this kind of policy had been tested to destruction in Britain above all other countries. There are the usual clichds about the supposed excessive tax-cutting stimuli provided by Lawson, even though the tax burden moved within a narrow range on either side of 38 per cent of gross domestic product during his whole period at No 11. Johnson's final verdict is almost a caricature of cen- trism. There were, he says, seven clearly successful policy outcomes (including labour productivity and union reform), seven clearly unsuc- cessful ones (for instance, unemployment and monetary targets) and seven mixed out- comes (among them growth and inflation). Nevertheless, the body of the book is relent- lessly adversarial; and the author fails to grasp the wider meaning of the defeat of the Scargill miners' union and, later, of the printing unions. His ultimate criticism of both Thatcher and Lawson is for not deferring enough to the \"insti- tutions of the country\" includ- ing the Civil Service and the Incomes policy bought a respite, but when it exploded, the establishment's cupboard was bare National Economic Develop- ment Council. Unfortunately the author has not realised, or has forgot- ten, how demoralised the Reform Club economic estab- lishment was in the 1970s and how impossible it was to follow its advice even if a minister wanted to - as;Denis Healey found out before the change of government. Unemployment wa ', pointing policy in' one direction and inflation (for which sterling was sometimes a proxy) was pointing in the opposite one, according to the rules of the post-war consen- sus. Incomes policy may have bought a few years' partial respite, but when that exploded the establishment's =cubard was bare, as Andrew Bitton concedes. From this failure of percep- tion, most of the more detailed faults of the book follow. Mr Johnson makes his task unnec- essarily difficult by following the Treasury, Committee in its exclusive preoccupation with the most technocratic aspects of monetarism without coming face to face with its direct chal lenge to the government's abil- ity to spend its way into target levels of activity and employ- ment. Thus he falls to see the point of Nominal GDP and related measures. These are not a mistaken endeavour to add together output and prices, like apples and pears, but are an attempt to influence demand in cash terms - which is all that the central authori- ties can do with monetary and fiscal weapons. Unfortunately the worst and most muddled chapter is the first, on economic growth. This contains the only tendentious chart in the book, which is again the first one. This shows a single trend of output from 1969 to 1989, with output far below trend during most of the 1980s and not even exceeding it in the boom at the end. This view is inconsistent with the author's, now conventional, criticism of the government for overstimulating demand at the end of the 1980s. Johnson frequently jumps between growth in the sense of the underlying trend of output of which the economy is capa- ble, and growth in the short-term sense of variations which occur in boom and slump. There are silly debating points made by contrasting the government's claim that it could not control growth in the first sense by demand manage- ment, and quotations from the Budget Red Books which were attempts by Treasury econo- mists to forecast short-term variations, which clearly are demand-determined. If an economic teenager wanted some adult reading, I would advise him to look at Johnson's graphics and Brit- ton's text - but then write his own essay on why neither does justice to the changes for which Mrs Thatcher was, for all her faults, the catalyst.

Sir, You reported (\"Institu- tions urge fuller financial information\", September 2) that the National Association of Pension Funds is asking the Accounting Standards Council (ASC) to consider a new report- ing format similar to the IOK Report required in the United States. A concept of this kind is long overdue. The concept is the punctual filing, in a standardised for- mat, of a wide range of impor- tant financial information.

Disclosure standards in the UK are too slight and too slow. The ASC would be performing a public benefit if they lobbied the legislators for this sea- change in the UK's reporting system. It is not necessary to install a Securities and Exchange Commission simply to compel tougher reporting requirements. Peter Molony, I maton Pls, Lomfon.",

   "text_content" : "ao stares down Impassively from the edge of Tiananmen Square. Next month, on national day, his portrait will be flanked by those of Marx and Lenin. There has been no jubilant smashing of communist icons in Beljing. Instead, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, goose-stepping across the square in their drab, olive- green uniforms, offer a grim reminder of the bloody sup- pression two years ago of China's hopes of democracy. Communism may have van- ished in eastern Europe and collapsed last month in the Soviet Union, but in the world's most populous nation a concoction known as Marxist- Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought still guides the destiny of more than 1bn people. Freedom of speech, even of thought, are proscribed; but in the economy markets are gradually winning the battle against ideology. For an observer arriving in Beijing after a day in the spiri- tually vibrant but physically bleak streets of Moscow, this strange blend of political authoritarianism and economic liberalism produces a jarring collision of images. The repression is there in the video cameras around Tiananmen which deter local citizens from any casual, taint- ing, encounter with western visitors. It leaps out from the bland propaganda of the offi- cial China Daily as it reports the soothing words of a prison governor as proof that political detainees are well-treated. An attempt to venture through the towering stone walls which enclose Beijing university is met with a curt rebuff by the surly guards sta- tioned at every gate. The stu- dents, the vanguard of the pro- democracy movement in 1989, must be isolated from western sympathisers. But then there are the cars - shiny 1980s models, not the tatty antiques which rattle around Moscow. In Beijing, Peugeots, Volkswagens and Mercedes jockey for the rapid- ly-diminishing space on the impressive ringroads. The shops are full. On Nan Chi Zi, a nondescript street of single-storey houses near the centre of town, the pavement stalls are stacked high with vegetables and fruit. They are privately grown and privately sold. \"It is always like this,\" our interpreter told us. \"There is no need to queue\". Along Hai Dian street, on the edge of the university cam- pus, young entrepreneurs have set up electronic and computer stores in what has become known as Beijing's version of Silicon Valley. Many were closed down in late 1989, their owners branded capitalist allies of the rebellious stu- dents. But China needs the technology. Now they seem to be thriving again. This week Mr John Major, the visiting British prime min- ister, told the country's leaders that their precarious balancing act was not sustainable. They could not, he said, shelter indefinitely from the storm of political change which had wiped out communism in the west. His hosts, Premier Li Peng, President Yang Shang- 'Stability' was the word that surfaced repeatedly during the two days of talks kun, party general secretary Jiang Zemin - the godfathers of Tiananmen Square - intend to do just that. At a banquet on Monday marking the start of the visit, Li Peng sought to dismiss at the outset the inevitable paral- lels being drawn with events in Moscow. There were deep cul- tural and social differences; the people of China valued above all stability. The present sys- tem delivered prosperity in a nation where the overriding human right was that to food. China wanted stability. Stability. It was a word which British officials said sur- faced again and again in the two days of talks. It is the one that has been the most promi- nent in the sparse reporting of the abortive Soviet coup in China's state-run media. The moral being drawn in newspaper editorials and in an intensified programme of party gatherings in schools and sac- tories is that to forsake com- munism would be to plunge China into the chaos now engulfing the Soviet Union. Communism is the nation's cement. It is an argument that even some supporters of the-pro-de- mocracy movement admit has resonance with many Chinese. A young opponent of the regime - no-one who voices opposition can be identified more specifically - says that his conviction that political freedom is inevitable is tem- pered by a preference for steady over revolutionary change. Free-thinking intellec- tuals were jealous of the hectic uprooting of communism in eastern Europe but their num- bers were still small. Yet for all the public cer- tainty of Li Peng and his octo- genarian mentors, there were hints of a nervous edge in the meetings with the British. Mr Major's blunt condemna- tion of political detentions and religious persecution - against the advice of his ever- cautious foreign advisers - was met for a while with a ritual recital of Britain's inglo- rious role in the 19th century opium wars. But the response from the Chinese had little of the angry indignation of previ- ous such exchanges. By yester- day Beijing was ready to announce that a detainee from Hong Kong will be freed. Mr Major looked the winner. Both he and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, fresh from their talks in Moscow, were struck also by the insatiable appetite of their hosts to hear Britain's assess- ment of what is happening in the Soviet Union. If China's rulers insist that disintegration of a communist superpower has few implications for their own grip on power, they appear insecure enough to want to chart every twist and turn in the most precise detail. It may be that they too are beginning to wonder if the march of history is against them. As Mr Major ended his visit yesterday with a walk along the nation's most star- tling monument, the Great Wall was shrouded in mist. So too seemed China's future.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens and Angus Foster in Hong Kong MR John Major will today seek to reassure Hong Kong's politi- cal and business communities that Britain will not make fur- ther concessions to China before the colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. As he arrived last night, prominent local leaders voiced concern that his agreement this week with China to inten- sify co-operation over Hong Kong's future gave too much influence to Beijing. In a series of meetings with local businessmen and politi- cians later today, Mr Major will provide a detailed account of his talks this week with Chi- nese leaders. He will insist that the memorandum of under- standing on the construction of a new international airport will not provide China with a lever to interfere in other deci- sions before the transfer. A sign by Beijing yesterday that it will release one of four Hong Kong people jailed after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989 will allow Mr Major to claim that his tough stance this week on human rights is yielding results.

But the prospective release of Mr Luo Hai Sing, a Hong Kong businessman jailed for five years for allegedly try- ing to help Chinese dissidents flee the country, appeared to support his detemination to maintain a tough line. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the colony's largest political group- ing, said Mr Major's stance on the issue was not enough. \"I am glad to see Mr Major stressed human rights, but it is highly ironic he continues to deny democracy and free elec- tions to Hong Kong,\" he said. Hong Kong holds its first direct elections next week when 18 out of 60 seats will be elected. Mr Lee, whose party is expected to do well, will call on the UK to keep its promise to increase the number of directly elected seats before 1997. Mr Major marked his arrival with a visit to one of the camps holding Vietnamese boat peo- ple and promised to redouble efforts to end the exodus from Vietnam. He will face tough questioning about British insis- tence that Hong Kong should be maintained as a port of first asylum for bona fide refugees, rather than for economic migrants. More than 60,000 boat people are camped in the colony and most local people want the asylum policy ended.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Smith and Ivor Owen BRITAIN'S trade unions yesterday gave unanimous backing for the first time to the Labour party's plans for a national minimum wage. Their endorsement at the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow was accompanied by publication of an opinion poll showing strong public support for the policy. The poll, commissioned by the GMB general workers' union and conducted by Mori, found that 76 per cent of all voters, and 69 per cent of Con- servative voters, backed a min- imum wage of Â£3.40 an hour. Respondents also indicated a greater willingness to vote Labour after being told of the minimum wage plan. A Con- servative lead of 2 percentage points was transferred to a Labour lead of 4 percentage points among the same voters after the minimum wage ques- tion was raised. ) Mr Michael Howard, employ- ment secretary, yesterday con- demned the vote. The TUC \"and the party it owns\" had committed themselves to a pol- icy of staggering economic illit- eracy, he said. At the TUC, unions united John Edmonds yesterday: Labours pay policy \"a real vote winner. Let us snout it mrom tie roottops\" behind a policy of pushing for more co-ordinated pay bargain- ing and a minimum wage but rejected wage restraint. Mr Gavin Laird, general sec- retary of the AEU engineering union, who earlier this year said he opposed a minimum wage in the private sector, said his union supported a mini- mum wage but would not toler- ate a squeezing of pay differen- tiais. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said his union's poll showed that \"we have a real vote winner on our hands. So do not let us be coy about it. Let us shout it from the rooftops.\" But Mr Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, indicated that unions might have to make concessions on pay if they were to achieve demands on a range of issues including the minimum wage, investment in manufacturing and equal opportunities. \"If we are going to achieve these aspirations - if we are going to have proper, honest and open discussions with the next Labour govern- ment - we have to accept that it cannot be all one way.\" ' Mr Howard accused the TUC of having voted to \"abandon the unemployed\" and reaffirmed the Department of Employ- ment's estimate that the first stage of Labour's minimum wage policy alone \"could destroy between 1.25 and 1.5m jobs. The employment secretary told an audience in the West Midlands that the second stage of Labour's policy - which could destroy up to 2m jobs in the country as a whole - could raise job losses in their area to 186,000. He claimed that a minimum wage would not only threaten jobs in every part of the economy but hit hardest those most dependent on low paid employment. Congress reports, Page 9",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent MOST OF the M25 - London's orbital motorway - will be converted from three lanes to four in each direction over the next six years at a cost of Â£lbn. A further Â£1.8bn has been ear- marked for other improve- ments. The extra lanes will be installed within the existing motorway corridor by adding a strip at the edge of the car- riageways and narrowing the two overtaking lanes. The sec- tion between the M4 and the M40 will be the first to be con- verted. The Â£2.8bn cost of the improvements - announced within five years of the road's completion - is far in excess of London Transport's total investment budget for the next three years and has provoked strong protests from the public transport lobby. The Automobile Association also criticised the plans on safety grounds because of the need to narrow some lanes. However, the move was gen- erally welcomed by the roads lobby. The Freight Transport Association said M25 delays had been costing industry Â£1,200 a year for each lorry. Traffic flows on the M25 have greatly exceeded govern- ment forecasts since the last stretch of the 121-mile circular motorway opened in 1966. Mr Christopher Chope, min- ister for roads and traffic, said that in the longer term, the department planned to build collector distributor roads - parallel motorways which take local traffic off the main high- way - to relieve congestion on the busiest sections. Other planned improvements included better lighting, better signposts, and the installation of traffic lights at access points to control the rate at which traffic could join the motor- way. He said the Â£2.8bn cost of widening and improving the M25 - roughly 2% times the original construction cost - was justified by the need to relieve congestion. Transport 2000, the public transport pressure group, said the plans were \"a step towards realising the self-fulfilling prophesy that road traffic will double by the year 2025\". The plans were especially ironic, the group said, in the light of British Rail's decision to reduce services in the south- east. Mr Chope acknowledged that increasing the capacity of the M25 could generate traffic flows that might otherwise not exist, but said it would also help take existing traffic off unsuitable roads.

   "text_content" : "The Bank of England was at pains to stress that yesterday's base rate cut was a measured response to the decline in infla- tion. But the uncharacteristic speed with which it was pushed through betrays a polit- ical impulse as well. That may help explain why the stock market ended the day margin- ally lower. Admittedly a cut within the next month was already largely discounted. Yet whatever Mr John Major's real intention, a degree of political uncertainty has suddenly entered the investment equa- tion. Yesterday's move has not changed expectations for the slightly longer term. In theory, there should be scope for a fur- ther cut to 10 per cent around the party conference in early October, but anything more would push UK rates uncom- fortably close to those of Ger- many. Helped by yesterday's mortgage cut, October's infla- tion figure should be below 3.5 per cent and markedly less than that of Germany. But even low inflation countries like the Netherlands tradition- ally pay a premium over Ger- man rates. A single figure base-rate still looks problem- atic. With rates thus now so close to their apparent low, there is increased risk of disappoint- ment if Mr Major is forced to back away from a November date. Doubts about the Tories' ability to win next year could then quickly pervade the for- eign exchange market, which viewed yesterday's develop- ments with equanimity. Coats Viyella Coats has not lost its reputa- tion for spin, which means investors have to be on their guard for the googlies. Much was made yesterday, for exam- ple, of the mere 6 per cent dip in like for like first half operat- ing profits, less of the 18 per cent underlying drop at the pre-tax level when the exchange rate gain and prop- erty sales are taken out and redundancy provisions added. back in. Year end gearing counting the euroconvertible as debt is still likely to be uncomfortably high at more than 50 per cent, while the indicative Â£65m-Â£70m of gross integration costs to be written off for Tootal will raise the odd eyebrow. That said, Coats appears to be managing its cash well and is beginning to show tangible benefits from the merger.

The timing of the recovery is probably the most important consideration for the shares, which at 172p are looking to 1993 profits in the region of Â£200m, against the Â£llOm-Â£115m widely antici- pated for this year. That may seem a tall order at the moment with US industrial thread and knitwear the only bright spots deemed worth mentioning yesterday. The company and its better bal- anced management, though, are worth backing for the long term - and when profits do finally start to motor, the unrelieved ACT will give a useful boost to earnings per share. Hillsdown The market has been rather disdainful of the steady improvement by Hillsdown. Even after yesterday's 4 per cent correction, its shares are barely above their level of six months ago. But the interim figures confirmed that the group has been doing all the right things on the trading front - strengthening the core food businesses, reducing bor- rowings, hinting again at the disposal of furniture and housebuilding once the cycle is more favourable to asset val- ues. Poultry was disappointing, although the fundamentals suggest an improvement in 1992. That apart, the perfor- mance of food was impressive, particularly in Canada where Maple Leaf Foods accounted for more than half the process- ing division's Â£58m profits. The well-covered increased divi- dend is a sign of growing confi- dence among the management. Still, full-year profits, assum- ing reasonable Christmas trad- 1 a L a a Y P 1 a J 3 a a r r Y IÂ· r e a n e e g e e d. s I- i, s R e d ,- e i- iÂ· t. I- LÂ· ing, are likely to be little more than flat at about Â£200m. It will be a long haul before Hills- down's new generation of chickens comes home to roost. The prospective multiple of about 10 is as undemanding as ever, but investors looking for excitement will probably continue to look else- where. Wimpey/Amec It was a brighter day for con- tracting and construction shares yesterday, but the inter- est rate cut apart there was precious little from which to gain comfort. Amec admittedly is less gloomy than some about the future - but then its expo- sure to the healthy offshore sector was already well known and its generous dividend pol- icy is only appropriate for a company which has tapped investors to the tune of almost Â£300m in three years. As for Wimpey, there was obvious relief that rights issue rumours were wide of the mark, and that provisions come the year end will not be significant. Notwithstanding the com- pany's confidence that it can dig itself out of the hole, the process still looks like a long hard slog. The proceeds from Little Britain are not due for another nine months; in the meantime the company will be wanting to replenish its land bank just as those once lucra- tive contracting cash flows start to turn down. What a pity the non-core businesses were not discovered sooner. BAT Industries After the dismal results from Eagle Star a couple of weeks ago there was not much left to shock in BAT Industries interim figures yesterday. But the prospect of an uncovered dividend for the second year running raises the question of when the benefits will finally flow from the reshaping that followed the Hoylake bid. Sec- ond half earnings will again be dented by provisions at Eagle remainng salesstaff may yet prove restless in spite of all the sweet talking from the new chief executive imported from Mars. Doubtless the shares would have fallen further with- out the company's commit- ment to raising dividends fas- ter than inflation. The prospective yield of about 5 per cent still looks skimpy, how- ever, given that the pay-out will have to grow more slowly than earnings to rebuild cover when recovery does finally set in.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent WIMPEY, one of Britain's biggest and best-known con- struction groups, barely broke even during the first six months of this year. Pre-tax profits during the six months to the end of June were only Â£200,000 compared with profits of Â£12.6m at the corre- sponding stage last year. After all deductions the group made a loss of Â£8.4m compaed with a profit of Â£8m n the first six months of 1990. Wimpey blamed the losses on the deep recession in UK and US housebuilding and commercial property markets. The results compared unfa- vourably with half-year figures announced yesterday by AMEC, another large UK construction group, which revealed that its pre-tax profits had fallen by almost a quarter to Â£21.9m. Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said the group planned to make \"significant\" disposals to raise money to reduce borrowings and to pro- vide for new investment. The group last month announced it had sold a 50 per cent stake in the Little Britain property development in London for Â£110m. The proceeds will not be available until the second half next year when the building has been completed. The cost of finishing the devel- opment led to a net cash outflow of about Â£30m during the first half. At the end of June net debt was Â£372m, equivalent to 58 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Dwyer said the group had paid Â£15.4m in interest which was more than the Â£11.5m it had paid to shareholders in divi- dends. For the second time in six months the group has had to dip into reserves to pay shareholders who will receive a maintained interim dividend of 4p. Mr Dwyer said eIJntended to reduce gearing to below 50 per cent by disposing of peripheral and under-performing busi- nesses. He declined to discuss which companies or activities might be up for sale. Sir Clifford Chetwood, Wim- pey's chairman, said that there was no sign of any Improvement in the housing markets in the UK in spite of successive falls in interest rates. He said potential buyers had become Increasingly concerned about rising unem- ployment and the economy. US housing operations had also continued to suffer during the first half. Wimpey, however, did not expect to make further provisions against losses in UK and US housing following the Â£82m of provisions it made at the end of last year. Contracting profits had held up welL The group's order book at the end of June stood at Â£900m compared with Â£lbn at the same stage last year. Orders, however, were becoming more difficult to win and margins were uader pressure. Profts for the aggregates in the UK and US were down slightly. The group said that turnover and output had held up well but margins had come under pressure. Mr Dwyer said that spending on re-equiping quarries In the UK and US and on replenishing the group's UK housing land- bank had recommenced. Lex, Page 14, AMEC results, Page 16",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew!Bolger BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services conglomerate, has appointed the head of the Mars Corporation's confectionery business in the UK to lead Allied Dunbar, its life insurance subsid- iary. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, said he was pleased to gain the marketing skills of Mr George Greener as managing director of Allied Dunbar, which had. the biggest direct-sales force in the UK insurance industry. BAT also announced that the group's pre-tax profits fell by 24 per cent to Â£413m in the six months to June 30, mainly because of Eagle Star, the UK Tony Andrews George Greener (left), new chief executive of Allied Dunbar, takes his place beside Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT insurance subsidiary, which made heavy losses on its mort- gage indemnity business. Sir Patrick said the decline in profits was more severe than expected. He blamed the length and impact of the UK recession, particularly on the property and small business sectors. Eagle Star moved from a pre- tax profit of Â£21m in the first half of last year to a loss of Â£189m. It made underwriting losses of Â£331m, mainly in the UK. BAT's overall group turnover grew by 3 per cent to Â£9.075bn, but earnings per share slumped by 48 per cent to 10p. Neverthe- less, the interim dividend was raised by 8 per cent to 22.4p. Sir Patrick said it was impossi- ble to be anything other than pessimistic in the short term about Eagle Star's general insur- ance business, and provisions in the second half were likely to be as bad as in the first six months. However, more encouragingly, the group's other financial ser- vice businesses, Farmers in the US, Allied Dunbar, and Eagle Star Life, made good progress in difficult circumstances. Trading profit from tobacco grew by 5 per cent to Â£453m and cigarette volumes rose by 3 per cent. Sir Patrick said there had been a second-quarter decline arising from the timing of orders, but since the half-year there had been a resumption of growth. Tobacco volumes in the US domestic market were lower in the first half and the shift to value brands offset the benefit of price increases. Exports rose, mainly in the Far East, resulting in substantially higher profits. Farmers raised its contribution to trading profits by 15 per cent to Â£168m. Eagle Star's life busi- ness had increased profits by 4 per cent to Â£28m, although turn- over was down. Allied Dunbar's contribution to group trading profit was up 15 per cent to Â£62m.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper Yesterday's announcement of a new chief executive to head Allied Dunbar, the life assurance and unit trust subsidiary of BAT Industries, marks another step by Sir Pat- rick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, to re-establish the credibility of his group's tobacco-to-insurance strategy. In the 1980s, the performance of Eagle Star (bought in 1984), Allied Dunbar (acquired in 1985) and Farmers, the Californian- based insurer bought in 1988, added a new dimension to BAT's solid tobacco business, which was increasingly facing long-term concerns over health. Over the last 12 months, how- ever, the exodus of important executives at Allied Dunbar and a series of disastrous results at Eagle Star has cast doubt on the strategic blend and raised con- cerns about the industrial man- agement's ability to run an insur- ance business effectively. The worst problems have been at Eagle Star, where interim losses badly dented BAT's own half-year profits which were announced yesterday. This year's Â£189m losses at Eagle Star - principally because of losses on domestic mortgage indemnity business - follow disastrous losses last year on the insurance of loans to developers of residential and commercial property. Eagle Star had expan- ded rapidly into this sector - critics would argue recklessly - since the mid-1980s. By contrast, the problems of Allied Dunbar are less serious. The group saw strong perfor- mance in the first half of this year, when new business increased at a rate faster than the industry average and profits grew by 15 per cent on the same period last year. The appointment of Mr George Greener fills a management hole created last October when Allied Dunbar's two founders - Sir Mark Weinberg, chairman, and Mr Mike Wilson, chief executive - announced that they were quitting the company, along with a number of senior executives. Official explanations failed to disguise the deteriorating rela- tions between BAT and Allied Dunbar founders and a number of Allied Dunbar staff - 23 to date - have left to join the new life company formed by the two men which is based at Cirences- ter, near Allied's Swindon head- quarters. As one analyst pointed out ear- lier this year \"The defection of senior management from a com- pany widely seen as a manage- ment success story must give cause for concern.\" The effectiveness of the BAT management will be a decisive factor in the 1990s. Certainly the group's underlying strategy to move towards financial services is becoming clearer and the suc- cessful experiences of Allied Dun- bar and Farmers are increasingly influencing BAT thinking. Unlike Eagle Star, which is heavily dependent on sales by independent intermediaries and brokers, Farmers and Allied Dun- bar have direct salesforces and can achieve much greater control over distribution. Both companies also do busi- ness in a way which reduces their exposure to risk. Allied Dunbar specialises in selling unit-linked investment products (unit trusts, life insurance and pensions) in which the policy- holder - rather than the insurer - takes much of the risk. Farmers subcontracts its non- life underwriting operations to a number of mutual insurers and is paid a commission on the amount of premium earned, a fact which cushions it against the vagaries of the Californian motor insurance market. Allied Dunbar is imitating Farmers in the medical insurance arena, which it entered this year, by marketing and packaging products underwritten by Lloyd's syndicates. Already Eagle Star has reduced the amount of commercial insur- ance it is prepared to underwrite, concentrating instead on less vol- atile personal lines and life busi- ness. The group has already backed out of commercial mortgage indemnity insurance and is rene- gotiating with building societies about its domestic mortgage indemnity business. Increasingly in the 1990s, Eagle Star is also likely to seek control of its own marketing, reducing its dependence on sales by bro- kers and building societies. \"There has to be more control over distribution,\" says Sir Pat- rick. \"There might not be quite as much growth in the 1990s as there was in the 1980s. However, when recovery does come, we believe savings and pensions will grow faster than the growth in GDP. We want to share that busi- ness, but we've got to be good at it, and avoid some of the mis- takes we've made in the past.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd and Sara Webb in London and Patrick Harverson in Washington THE TREASURY yesterday announced that it had dropped Salomon Brothers as its US lead manager in the sale of part of its BT shareholding in November. Mr Norman Lamont, chancel- lor of the exchequer, yesterday accepted the recommendation of the government's advisers that Salomon should be sacked. Lord Young, the former cabi- net minister who is now a direc- tor of Salomon, was unable to persuade ministers that the US investment bank should con- tinue to play a role in the Â£5bn privatisation. Goldman Sachs is the favourite to become US lead manager. It was runner-up in the original selection. Salomon is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Fed- eral Reserve, the New York Stock Exchange, the Treasury department and the anti-trust division of the Justice Depart- ment, for rigging Treasury bond auctions. Meanwhile, in the first Con- gressional hearing into the scan- dal, the US Treasury Department and the New York Federal Reserve Bank came under fire from Congressional legislators yesterday for falling to uncover Salomon's illegal bond market activities. At hearings before a House of Representatives committee in Washington, the Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve Board revealed they did not know until August of this year that Salomon had rigged auc- tions of new US government securities - almost six months after the authorities were first alerted. The hearing was also told that Salomon had controlled 93 per cent of a new issue of two-year notes last May. Evidence pres- ented to the committee showed that Salomon and a handful of customers owned $10.6bn (Â£6.3bn) of a $11.3bn issue of new two-year notes in May. Salomon used its domination to obtain favourable interest rates on loans from dealers and investors. Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the financial mar- kets watchdog, suggested to the committee some changes in US securities law, including making the use of false or inaccurate information in Treasury auction bids illegal, imposing sales prac- tice rules on dealers and Inves- tors in bonds, and allowing the SEC to promote dissemination of Treasury market prices.",

Pre-tax profits fell to Â£20.3m (Â£46.1m) on sales up 12 per cent. at Â£696m following the acquisi- tion of JPI, the US vehicle parts company, last year. The group made a Â£7.6m pro- vision against redundancies, bringing to an end a two-year programme that will cut 5,000 jobs at a cost of Â£2m. Earnings fell from 10.97p to 2.82p but the interim dividend is maintained at u.6p. Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said that apart from some mod- est improvement in the US, there were few signs of recov- ery in dehand and that signifl- cant upturn was unlikely before 1982. He said the company was in much better shape to take advantage of any upturn. In addition to the slimmer work- force, it had spent Â£l80m on new plant and equipment and had maintained its research and development budget. However, the drop in UK profits led to a jump in the tax charge to 45 per cent partly due to a higher advance corpo- ration tax write-of Auto components sales fell from Mam to 2356mn on the pre4PI business, while profits fell from Â£34.1m to Â£18.9m. JPI contributed sales of llOm and profits of Â£7.6m. Mr Hope said there were signs that this sec- tor was beginning to improve. Engineering and industrial sales were virtually unchanged at Â£232m but profits fell to Â£21.4m (Â£31.9m) in the pre-JPI business - JPI contributed Â£2.5m. This was due to falling aerospace, consumer and engi- neering demand in the UK. The division also suffered because of difficultes fced by Rolls-Royce, T&N's larest cu tomer ft turbine components. * COMMURT T&N's is a tale of dramatic contrasts.

Brent Walker will, in the next few days, send out a notice convening an extraordi- nary meeting with the aim of seeking to remove Mr Walker and Mr John Hemingway as directors. The 47 banks involved are confident that they will win the vote. On this occasion, they need a simple majority to suc- ceed.

The removal of Mr Walker and Mr Hemingway from the company is a condition of the refinancing, according to a note in the annual report for 1990, which was belatedly pub- lished yesterday. Brent Walker will go into receivership with- out the refinancing. The annual report also gives more details of the bitter dis- putes between Mr Walker, founder of the group, and the new directors. The company is claiming that Jasaro, Mr Walker's fam- ily trust, owes it Â£15m on the trust's purchase from the com- pany of French vineyards in 1989. However, the trust wants repayment of Â£10m which it lent to Brent Walker. There is also a dispute about the transfer to Heatrace Properties of a building in Holborn, London, which was formerly the headquarters of Brent Walker's betting shops. Mr Jason Walker, Mr Walker's son, has an interest in Heatrace. Mr George Walker said yes- terday that his family had taken control of the property to offset a Â£3m loan he made to Brent Walker. He said the property was worth only Â£1.5m. The report also discloses that Mr Walker was paid Â£606,000 last year. Mr Walker said he was furious that the company had not made it clear that Â£300,000 of this was a bonus earned in 1988. Another note to the accounts indicates that the company made some unexpected invest- ments in the past couple of years. In 1990, it bought a 10 per cent shareholding in Tunis International Bank. Mr Walker said this stake was acquired at the same time as the company was working with Tunis on a leisure devel- opment in Tunisia. He also dis- closed that the bank helped find buyers for about Â£2m of the company's convertible bonds, which were issued last December. In November and December, Brent Walker's Netherlands subsidiary acquired a holding in Power Corporation, the Irish group which is joint owner with Brent Walker of a prop- erty developer, Walker Power. Brent Walker also has a shareholding in Arab Banking Corporation - one of the banks which has loans to the company.",

Akzo, the Netherlands-based chemicals group, has refused to comment on reports that it is negotiating to buy Macpher- son, one of the largest paint companies in Britain, from Tik- kurila of Finland for Â£40m. Macpherson also refused to comment. Tikkurila, the paints subsid- iary of the state-owned Kemira Oy chemicals concern, bought Macpherson - best-known as the manufacturer of Wool- worth's paint range - for Â£25m, in a competitive auction six years ago. Akzo, one of the fastest growing coatings com- panies in the world, gained a foothold in Britain by buying Blundell Permoglaze at about the same time. The reports emanate from a document trades union leaders at Macpherson's factory in Bury, Greater Manchester, \"intercepted\". Mr Mike Willis, branch officer of the Manage- ment, Science and Finance Union, said: \"The document makes it clear that a firm bid from Akzo is near completion.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent THE RECESSION in the construction industry reduced pre-tax profits of Amec, the contracting, engineering and property group, by almost a quarter from Â£28.6m to Â£2L9m in the first six months of this year. In spite of the profits fall, the company's share price rose by 15p to 218p on the grounds that the interim results were better than many construction com- panies were likely to produce over the next few weeks. Mr Alan Cockshaw, chair- man, warned that there was unlikely to be any substantial improvement in profits until 1993, even though the industry was now probably at the bot- tom of the recession. The company, nevertheless, is increasing its interim dividend from 3.875p to 4p. Mr Cockshaw said the deci- sion demonstrated directors' confidence in the group's financial strength. Following a Â£110m rights in the spring, the group is thought to have net cash of about Â£60m. At the corresponding stage last year the group had net borrowings of Â£50m - equiva- lent to about 15 per cent of shareholders' funds. Earnings per share, after allowing for the effects of the rights issue, fell from 7.8p to 6p. Some of the cash raised has been used to acquire Hawker Alan Cockshaw: no improvement IlkelSr turtil Siddeley power transmission and a stake in Serete, a French engineering group. Amec is expected to announce shortly a further strengthening of its growing European engin- eering and construction inter- ests. The company's strengths in the first half of this year included its oil, gas and petro- chemical businesses. Civil engineering also held up well as higher margin contracts won in the late 1980s started to come through as profits. Mr Cockshaw said building and civil engineering profits had risen from Â£10.1m to E11.6m, in spite of a dip in turnover from Â£416m to Â£390.1m. Mechanical and electrical engineering profits had fallen from Â£21.7m to Â£13m, mainly due to delayed payments on \"four or five\" contracts. The weakest area during the first half was the housing and property division where losses, almost entirely due to housing, rose from Â£600,000 to Â£1.3m. The group expects to sell about about 1,400 houses this year, about the same as in 1990. At its peak in 1988 the group was building about 2,000 homes a year. See Loex",

   "text_content" : "By John Autheor FIDELITY Investment Services, the fund management group, plans to launch an investment trust to invest in European companies. The move surprised many observers, as Fidelity has built up its fund management operations in the UK exclu- sively using open-ended unit trusts, rather than investment trusts, which are closed-end funds with quoted shares. The new company, to be called Fidelity European Val- ues, will be launched next month sponsored by UBS Phillips & Drew, the securities house. Mr Anthony Bolton, the fund manager, will aim to achieve long term capital growth in continental Euro- pean markets. Phillips & Drew will place Â£20m with institutions in advance, and intends to under- write another Â£20m which Fidelity would hope to raise from public flotation. The capi- tal structure is unusual - the trust will have one free war- rant for every five ordinary shares, and institutions can also buy loan stock linked to the FT-A Europe (ex-UK) Index. This loan stock will come to 25 per cent of the total ordinary shares issued. Fidelity will aim this trust, and subsequent investment trusts which it hopes to launch, at institutional inves- tors, rather than at the retail market. However, Mr Barry Bateman, managing director, said he regarded strong inves- tor confidence on the retail side as important if the shares are not to trade at a substan- tial discount to net asset value. Planned incentives for pri- vate investors include a savings scheme allowing pay- ments of as little as Â£50 per month, which will have no set-up charge, and a personal equity plan, which will have a front-end fee. Fidelity's annual management fee will be 1 per cent."

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller COATS VIYELLA'S first set of results since the Â£241m acquisi- tion of Tootal, its textile rival, showed a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, from Â£54.9m to '48.1m, in the first half of the year. Turnover declined to Â£877m (Â£912.7m). Tootal's one-month contribution of Â£41.9m was more than offset by disposals. Operating profit fell to 250.6m (Â£58.9m), with Tootal making Â£3.2m. Profits grew from an exchange gain of Â£5.4m, but a similar figure was knocked off for reorganisation. Mr Neville Bain, who became chief executive a year ago, said the combined group's central overheads were being cut by Â£8m, including shedding about half the top management from either side. Operational savings should amount to about Â£20m a year through bet- ter purchasing, amalgam- ations, closures and redundan- cies. Two things he had noticed as a relative newcomer to the business, from Cadbury Schweppes, was the need for better exploitation of brands, such as Jaeger and Sylko, and the quick response that had to be made to recession. Harsh trading conditions affected the group in the UK, where sales fell to Â£405.6m (Â£444.2m), and in both South and North America. Dewhirst Group, the clothing and toiletries com- pany, is buying two ladies- wear businesses from Coats Viyella for Â£14.1m. It is acquiring Slimma, which supplies Marks and Spencer with ladies' trou- sers, blouses and skirts, and a related garment factory in Malaysia. Mr Scott Beattie, company secretary, said this would add about Â£40m annual turnover to Dewhirst's Â£120m. Dewhirst had about Â£2.5m cash at its January year-end and would pay for the busi- nesses in cash and shares. Thread sales improved to Â£389.6m (Â£367.7m), but there was little like-for-like growth. Although crafts were strong, profits from Brazil were greatly reduced. In garments and retail, sales improved to Â£212.4m (Â£187.1m) with the help of a revival in knitwear, but Jaeger's margins suffered as consumer spending was squeezed. Homewares - mainly bed linen and carpets - were similarly affected. The worst line was fabrics, where sales slid to Â£87.8m (Â£155.8m) partly because of dis- posals, but also because of a poor UK performance. Cuts had been made and there were more to come. Precision engineering, a niche business called Dyna- cast, contributed Â£53m (Â£60.5m) to turnover. Gearing post-Tootal stood at 59 per cent including convert- ible bonds as debt, or 40 per cent treating them as equity. Net debt of Â£340m included Â£85m brought in with Tootal and about Â£180m borrowed to pay the cash element of the purchase. Debt was being reduced by business disposals - Â£44m had already come in - by property sales and cash-flow improve- ments. The target was to bring in between Â£100m and Â£200m over two years. Earnings per share fell to 4.28p (4.98p) and the interim dividend is held at 3p. See Lex",

Earnings rose by 47 per cent to 7.55p (5.15p), but by 20 per cent if effects of merger accounting are removed. The interim dividend is raised to 1.8p (1.5p).

About half of the seven busi- nesses to be sold operate out of premises shared with Black Horse residential estate agency branches and will continue to do so. Mr David Woodcock, operations director at Black Horse Agencies, described the sale as a friendly parting of ways.

The downturn from last time's Â£2.96m came on turn- over some 11 per cent lower at Â£5.33m. Earnings declined to 7.25p (8.7p) but the interim div- idend is stepped up from 2.75p to 3.125p. Directors said the acquisi- tion in August of Leicester Law Stationers should increase the customer base by 1,500 and add some Â£3m to annual turn- over. The shares closed 7p higher at 255p. Betacom bounces back into profit A strategy of European expan- sion, together with the success of its Classic and Venture ranges in the UK, helped Beta- com to return to profit in the first half in spite of an increas- ingly competitive domestic market. Pre-tax profit of Â£129,000 was achieved on sales of Â£6.12m in the six months to June 30, compared with a loss of Â£589,000 on sales of Â£7.3m last time. Earnings per share came to 0.41p (1.89p losses). The telecommunications group said sales fell by 16 per cent, caused mainly by retail trade destocking.",

   "text_content" : "miy Rlhard Gourlay CRODA International, the chemicals group, yesterday said it was cutting its Interim diridend, by a third after reporting a 41 per cent fall in profits. Mr Michael Valentine, chair- man, said the poor results, which were caused by the lon- ger-than-expected recession, had forced the company's first dividend cut since it came to the market. Maintaining the dividend would have led to an unaccept- able increase in tax arising from payment of advance cor- poration tax. Pre-tax profits fell from Â£17.2m to Â£10.2m in the half year to June 30, on sales down 9 per cent at Â£173.7m. Earnings per share fell from 8.9p to 5.1p and the dividend is cut from 4.Up to 2.75p. Mr Valentine said profits in the UK, the US and Australia had been hard hit by the reces- sion. Trading for the remain- der of the year would continue to be dominated by the weak economies and \"political uncer- tainty.\" Profits in speciality chemi- cals fell 37 per cent because of a reduction in volume and higher interest costs. Surface coatings had to con- tend with a sharp drop in demand. In the UK as a whole, sales of paint had fallen by 20 per cent over the past year, reflecting the depth of the recession, Mr Valentine said. Gearing at the half year was about 45 per cent and would remain at that level. - COMMWNT Shareholders have some right to be angry about the reduced dividend, even though the thin earnings cover in the past Michael Valentine: profits hit hard by the recession should have rung some alarm bells. Having spent five years improving efficiency and cut- ting costs, Croda had passed the peak of its capital expendi- ture programme and should have been facing easier times. Given the severity of the reces- sion, however, the company had little option but to stop paying nearly all its profits back to shareholders instead of expanding the business and reducing debt. Other compa- nies may well be forced to do likewise before this reporting cycle is over. For the full year, Smith New Court is forecasting pre-tax profits of Â£21m, giving 10.8p of earnings, and a pro- spective multiple after today's share price fall of 14.8.",

   "text_content" : "G E ORGE WIMPEY, the former west London stonemason which grew and grew to dominate the UK construction industry in the 1950s and 60s, has embarked on a fresh attempt to reverse the long-term decline in its fortunes. Mr Joe Dwyer, the 51-year- old chief executive who yester- day announced a pre-tax profit of just Â£200,000 for the first six months of this year, has launched a wide-ranging review of Wimpey's operations. The company, which has eschewed a rights issue, says that \"substantial\" disposals will have to be made to raise cash for new investment so that it can refocus its business. The Â£110m proceeds from the recently announced sale of Wimpey's 50 per cent stake in the Little Britain property development in London will not become available until the second half of next year. In the short term the com- pany needs money badly, both to replenish its UK housing land bank, which has been run down during the recession, and to re-equip its quarry busi- nesses in the UK and US. Thirty years ago, Wimpey consistently generated twice as much pre-tax profit as John Laing, its nearest rival, and three times as much as Taylor Woodrow, then the UK's third largest construction company. Since then it has lost its pre- eminence. Only four times dur- ing the past 13 years have pre- tax profits surpassed the Â£54.9m Wimpey made in 1980. Last year's pre-tax profits of Â£43.3m were Â£11.6m lower than those of 1980 and Â£13.9m lower than the Â£57.2m profits of 1978. The group, which was once Britain's biggest builder of local authority homes - it built 20,000 of them in 1965 - has struggled to overcome its dependence on the UK housing and property markets which plummeted at the end of the 1980s. By comparison, broadly- based construction, engineer- ing, property and building materials companies - such as Taylor Woodrow, Amec, Tar- mac and Trafalgar House - have developed a range of busi- nesses which has left them less susceptible to property market recessions. All are hurting but not as badly as Wimpey. Wimpey has made previous attempts to reshape itself. Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman and former chief executive, substantially reorganised and reduced Wimpey's cumber- some and top-heavy manage- ment during the early 19B0s. Across the company, more than 9,000 jobs, including many tiers of managers, were axed in the space of 2% years. In addition to its UK aggre gates business, Wimpey has developed other specialist and offshore engineering Interests. It has moved into waste man- agement and is one of the country's biggest open-cast coal operators. Unfortunately none of these businesses had been developed to sufficient size to cushion the group against the steep falls suffered by the property markets. An expansion into US hous- ing and aggregates was con- founded when the UK and US construction markets collapsed simultaneously at the end of the 1980s. More than 34 per cent of Wimpey's shares are held by Grove Charity Management, the charitable trust established by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, who acquired the west London busi ness in 1919 and during the next 60 years transformed it into a national and then inter- national contractor. The existence of such a large shareholding, although a deter- rent to would-be predators, does not always assist Wimpey. The requirements of the char- ity make it difficult for the group to issue shares either for a rights issue or to support a large acquisition. By comparison, Trafalgar House, was able to raise Â£310m through a rights issue this summer to support its Â£114m acquisition of Davy Corpora- tion, the UK engineering con- tractor. It will will bring together Davy McKee and John Brown in process plant contracting, and Monk and Cementation in construction, thereby creating the UK's biggest engineering and construction concern - a position once held by Wim- pey. Wimpey's relative decline, and it certainly remains a large business, is the classic story of company built largely through the energy and vision of a single man - Sir Godfrey Mitchell - who failed to estab- lish a proper management structure to progress the busi- ness when those powers 140. 120 100 80 60 40 150 Pre-tax profit (Cm) 13n4 i9ID IWo 1=W iURZ I54 115 1W 150W Souewr Dlnrm mnW started to wane. As a young army captain, Sir Godfrey bought Wimpey on his return from France. He had the ability to spot gaps in the mar- ket and one of his first deci- sions was to move into house- building in the 1920s. After the Second World War the group was the first UK company to break into international con- struction markets in a big way. In Britain, Wimpey devel- oped strong contacts with cen- tral and local government poli- ticians and officials which helped it win a large slice of the public sector's then rapidly growing construction work. Wimpey became so successful in winning airfield contracts during the war that a public inquiry was held in 1942 into the award of government con- tracts. In the 1950s Wimpey devel- oped new techniques for build- ing local authority homes just as the UK was embarking on a massive housebuilding pro- gramme. But by the time the 1960s arrived, things were beginning to look rather threadbare. Pub- lic sector work was sharply in decline, particularly the invest- ment in council housing. Inter- national work had also begun to hit problems especially in the Middle East where the group had traditionally been strong. In 1983 Wimpey announced provisions of more than Â£40m against its overseas activities. Sir Godfrey had been vehe- mently opposed to borrowing. Financial arrangements were only handled by himself and two other directors. Therefore the group was unable or unwilling to issue paper and, with only cash flow to support purchases, failed to make stra- tegic acquisitions to gain a bet- ter spread of businesses when the Ilump came. Um..gemant and accounting procedures were also some- times on the bizarre side. Before Sir Clifford's reorgan- isation in the early 1980s, the group had become a vast hotch-potch of separate busi- nesses, most of which had a large degree of autonomy. There were 17 separate regional companies, each responsible for all the com- pns activities - from hodee- bulding to roadbuilding -: in their area. Peripheral and non- profit-making businesses were sold or closed in a massive pruning operation. It was not enough. Sir Clif- ford, despite forecasting the housing market collapse 18 months before it happened, did not have enough time or money to turn the ship around. Even before the housing market peaked, Wimpey had started to reduce its house- building and land purchases in the UK. In spite of this, house- building accounted for more than 80 per cent of profits at the top of the boom in 1988. Mr'Dwyer says that any dis- posals would need to be \"sig- nificant\" if the group is to reduce its net debt of Â£372m and provide funds for further investment. The offshore engi- neering interests were sold this summer for Â£15m. Gearing, including debt asso- ciated with the Little Britain development, was 58 per cent at the end of the first half The group is also being reshaped in other ways. The retirement and resignations of senior directors have led to the appointment of a new, younger management team under Mr Dwyer who once played soccer for Crewe Alexandra. The team faces a range of problems. Shrinking order books following the collapse of the residential and commercial markets are now under pres- sure. Meanwhile police investiga- ting allegations of corruption arrested two of Wimpey's regional directors last year and subsequently raided the com- pany's headquarters. There have also been newspaper alle- gations that Wimpey has made payments to French politi- cians. Sir Clifford opines: \"It has been a stinker of a year.\" He hopes it can only get better from here. MI I I M 1",

   "text_content" : "I By Michael Chance POWERS of interrogation and powers to seize evidence are always contentious. The pow- ers of the police are in the news in the wake of allegations of fabrication of evidence in the case of the Birmingham Six, the six West Midlands men of Irish descent whose convic- tions for the November 1974 pub bombings in which 21 peo- ple died and 1G2 were injured were overturned by the Court of Appeal in March this year. The powers of the Serious Fraud Office have been critic- ised as they become more familiar following the Office's establishment in 1988 because they deprive citizens of tradi- tional rights. With the Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional affair sitting in the back- groud and the Serious Fraud Office recently called in by the board of Brent Walker to inves- tigate the troubled leisure group, the time is ripe to com- pare the various powers of investigators to collect evi- dence and the use they can make of it. The police investigate hun- dreds of thousands of serious cases each year. They use the investigative powers available to them nnder the 196 Police and Criminal Evidence Act ad they cannot normally require e to produce documents itt the authority of a mag- istrate or Judge.

This is an imprecise definition to find in an Act of parliament. There are strong views about whether a suspect's traditional \"right to silence\" should be removed at all. Certainly there is scope for the view that the removal of that right should not depend on the Serious Fraud Office director's subjec- tive judgment of the serious- ness or complexity of a case. The director's judgment is the more arbitrary because the availability of the Office's resources is another factor to be taken into account in decd- ing whether a case should be accepted for investigation. The Office is small and only about 25 new cases can be undertaken each year. Should a suspect's right to silence depend on whethir the Office s busy when his or her case is brought to its notice?

There are powers to investi- gate those engaged in particu- lar kinds of business under the 1986 Financial Services Act, the 1987 Banking Act and the 1982 Insurance Companies Act. These powers - unlike those of the Serious Fraud Office - were not created specifically for criminal investigations. They exist to aid public bodies responsible for supervising particular areas of commercial activity, but they are fre- quently invoked when criminal offences are suspected. A person's answers to ques- tions put to him by these other bodies can generally be placed before a jury at his or her trial. So these bodies enjoy the best of both worlds; unlike the police they can demand answers to their questions and unlike the SS0 they can use a person's answers against him. Al this begs questions about the extent to which it is legiti- mate for investigators to =e iangs Informatbln and for one in toto seek to p- suale a e to use his pow- ers if they appear to have avant-gs over his own.

Subjecting a suspect to suc- cessive questioning under two sets of powers might be seen as unsporting. To seek to use three sets of powers would be well below the belt. It seems fair to assume that investigators will, for the most part, rely on their own investi- gative powers, while perhaps occasionally casting an envi- ous glance at the powers of others. So one comes back to the arbitrary decision as to who is to conduct a particular investi- gation. There is also the ques- tion whether it is logical to limit the powers to demand answers to questions to partic- ular types of business and offence. After all, fraud is grave but murder is graver. It is worthwhile observing that although a person cannot, save in the circumstances out- lined above, be compelled to tell investigators what he knows, he can be compelled to attend court to give evidence. In the last resort a witness can be arrested and taken in custody to the court room, but it is rae indeed to take this stwhere the witness hes not earli disclosed, in interview, what hb er going to say. Against bbaackwmim l the package of power iavailable to the Serious Fraud Office becomes more Interest Given the restrictions on using a person's answers in evidence a him, the Seri- ous FadO e is more likely to use its powers to lnd what evidence a reluctant witness can give, rather than to inter- roeate a potential defendant.

The fall came despite turn- over up 26 per cent to Â£2.37bn (Â£1.88bn) following the pur- chase of 56 per cent of Maple Leaf Foods - formerly Canada Packers - last summer. That minority plus another at Strong & Fisher, the leather company rescued last year, produced charges of Â£10.3m (Â£1.7m) and was the main rea- son for an 18 per cent fall in earnings per share to 9.41p (11.46p). The interim dividend, however, goes up to 2.2p (2p). Sir Harry Solomon, chair- man, said food now accounted for more than 80 per cent of the business. \"The thrust of what we are doing is to be an international food business.\" Housebuilding and furniture might not fit in the future, but neither would be sold at the bottom of the cycle. Operating profit fell by less than Â£lm to Â£104.7m, helped by acquisitions. Interest charges grew to Â£27m (Â£26.6m). Gearing was on course to come down from 73 per cent last December to below 55 per cent with the help of sales. The food divisions contrib- uted Â£2.05bn to turnover, a 33 per cent increase, but only a small improvement to Â£84.7m (Â£81.2m) in operating profit, Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said poultry was the main problem area. Frozen chickens were a commodity and disarray in the UK market had been exacerbated by low prices following the diversion of French chickens from Mid- dle Eastern markets. Poultry operating profit fell by Â£12.3m to Â£13.5m. The pro- portion devoted to frozen chickens was being reduced to less than 25 per cent. Food processing, already the biggest part of the group before the Canadian acquisition, increased operating profit by 31 per cent to Â£58.2m. Sir Harry said the low margins at Maple Leaf were being improved. While furniture, affected by the sale of a stake in the retailer Wickes, declined to Â£5.7m (Â£8.5m), housebuilding and property, bolstered by con- centration on low-cost starter homes, only slipped to Â£16.5m (Â£17.9m).

   "text_content" : "I By Bernard Simon in Toronto THE SHAKE up by Hillsdown Holdings of its Canadian subsidiary has begun to bear fruit. The 56 per cent-owned Maple Leaf Foods produced a 60 per cent advance in second-quarter earnings in the face of lacklus- tre business conditions. Maple Leaf produced net earnings of C$17.lm (Â£8.85m), or 26 cents per share, in the three months to June 30, against C$10.7m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Operating profit climbed from C$27m to C$35m, and interest charges dropped from C$8.5m to C$3.5m. Hillsdown has cut a swathe through the Toronto-based company, Canada's biggest food processor, since it took control in mid-1990. It has pared the head office to a fraction of its former size, replaced senior management, sold off several businesses, consolidated others and reduced borrowings. The sale of the peanut butter and dairy subsidiaries and the closure of two Alberta beef abattoirs was reflected in an 11 per cent drop in sales to C$867m. The company also signed a letter of intent to sell its edible oils business. However, it also moved recently to expand in some val- ue-added products and in export markets. It acquired a frozen chicken processor with the aim of developing its poul- try business. In July, it bought AJ Mills, a small UK-based trading company. Talks to form a joint pro- cessed-meats distribution ven- ture with its main competitor, JM Schneider, were expected to be completed towards the end of the year. Maple Leaf warned that sev- eral of its markets were still suffering from over-capacity. They included flour milling, poultry processing and edible oils.",

The group, which specialises in ductwork, heat treatment and tubes, achieved the profits rowth in spite of a 9 per cent all in turnover to Â£142.3m (SÂ£156.m). Mr Donald McFarlane, man- aging director, said action to cut costs had improved mar- Te workforce had been reduced by about 10 per cent since last June to about 5,000 worldwide and working capital had been cut in line with sales. The interim dividend is raised to 1.2p (1.OSp). Earnings per share rose from 3.1p to 3.15p in spite of an increased tax charge. Mr McFarlane said the group's construction services companies, which supply duct- ing and ventilation systems to large projects such as Sizewell power station, had a good start and looked set to produce satisfactory profits for the year. The engineering products division, which makes rigid and flexible tubes, had suffered most from reduced demand; but continued to make money from lower volumes. Sales in some areas were down 25 per cent, but there was good demand for pressure tube from the generation industry and for flexible tubing. Mining equipment compa- nies had recovered from last year's poor results and a much improved outcome was expec- ted for 1991. Thermal engneerln comp- nies also produced better results in the UK, partly due to reducing costs. Mr McFarlane said he was concentrating on increasing the group's international expo. sure, particularly in Europe. Of some six or seven acquisition opportunities being examined, one or two were likely to come off. He wanted to expand the construction services, flexible hose and control equipment businesses. A total of Â£10m has been spent on two further heat treatment plants in Spain, plus the purchase of Nordklima, an air handing business in Ger- many, and Calorstat, a French flexible hose business. The group said that even on Continent after these acquisitions, gear- ing amounted to only 13.8 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "INTERIM PROFITS from Nestor-BNA, which runs nurs- ing agencies, hospitals and nursing homes and doctors' deputising services, suffered a setback in the 24 weeks to June 14. Turnover was maintained at Â£46.9m, but pre-tax profit declined 33 per cent to Â£2.39m (Â£3.54m) after Â£280,000 excep- tional costs of reorganising the UK nursing agencies division. The year started well with increasing revenues and prof- its, but that trend reversed in April and May. June, however, saw an overall improvement, according to Mr John Hann, chairman. Every division was profitable and producing cash, he added. Turnover in the UK nursing agencies division fell 19 per cent and operating profits by 59 per cent. There was a 43 per cent reduction in NHS busi- ness, reflecting the impact of spending restrictions. Further exceptional costs will arise in the second half. MRA, the US travel nursing division, increased turnover substantially and operating profit from Â£825,000 to Â£1.35m although margins were reduced. The specialised personnel businesses produced profits at less than half the level of a year ago. Earnings per share fell to 2.58p (4.4p) and the interim div- idend is again 1.15p."

The pre-tax figure of Â£40,000 was achieved on sales of Â£8.21m. The comparable period saw losses of Â£239,000 on sales of Â£9.89m. After the previous interim result a regrouping was under- taken to create a market research and marketing infor- mation consultancy trading under the Taylor Nelson ban- ner.

The company warned that profit inii the second half' would be lower than the previ. ous year. However, Mr Jack Hayes, managing director, said. they would not drip as sharply as in the first six months. Pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30 fell from IE30.8m to IÂ£21.1m (Â£19.2m). Turnover was down 5.5 per cent to Is571m. The most severe winter in four years hit trading in Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands, said Mr Tony Barry, chief executive. The UK, which claims a third of group turnover, was the hardest hit. Continental Europe, mainly Spain, Ger- many and the Netherlands, continued to perform satisfac- torily, he said. Business in the US was depressed by the effects of recession and uncertainty sur- rounding the Gulf war. Earnings per share came to 7.21p (8.8p). The interim divi- dend is increased by 7.5 per cent to 2.15p (2p). \"We have a progressive divi- dend policy,\" said Mr Hayes, \"and although profits are down in the short-term, we feel we have good prospects.\" Dividend cover was about 2.7 times and should be at least three by the year-end. Included above the line were provisions of I3.1m (I1.4m) for supplemental interest on I2123.7m convertible capital bonds. This was jn response to changes in accounting stan- dards. Gross debt, including the convertible bonds, was I601.5m. Gearing, taking the convertible bonds as debt, was 60 per cent. If the bonds were taken as equity, gearing would be 14 per cent. Mr Hayes said, however, that those figures would be nearer to 40 and 10 per cent respec- tively by the year-end if no further acquisitions were made.",

   "text_content" : "By Chritophw Parke\" in Bonn GERMlANY'S Commerzbank and France's Crddit Lyonnais yesterday confirmed that nego- tiations over a share swap had been scrapped, but insisted that routine co-operation through the Europartners grouping of banks - which also iInludes Banco di Roma and Spain's Banco Hispano- Americano - would be unaf- fected by the split. Commerzbank said only that the ending of negotiations had been agreed mutually. How- ever, the rift is a setback for the state-controlled French group's hopes of raising fresh capital to support its expansion plans, which some observers describe as \"over-ambitious\". Credit Lyonnais' lending has expanded rapidly in the past few years, and its exposure to the US film industry - esti- mated at $2.5bn, including some $700m lent to troubled MGM-Pathe - has been the subject of some controversy. Commerzbank may also have been disturbed by recent Credit Lyonnais expansion in Germany, which may have been taken to indicate that linkage through a share swap would not necessarily stop it from moving into its partner's territory. French officials were at pains to point out yesterday COMMERZBANK yesterday Increased its capacity to leand by raising DMS00m of new capital from German inves- tors, writes Simon London in London. The bank made an issue of profit-sharing certificates which pay annual interest of 9.4 per cent but offer near- equity risk. German banks cannot issue subordinated debt, and such issues are the main method used for raising non- equity capital. The certificates issued also have warrants attached, giv- ing the holder the right to buy Commerzbank shares at DM280 per share, a 10.2 per cent premium to yesterday's midday price of DM254. that Credit Lyonnais was already well-represented in Germany. It had a German subsidiary with 10 branches, an aircraft leasing business based in Frankfurt, and inter- ests in seven branches in Saar- land operated by Europartners. Commerzbank .is still engaged in its rapid expansion into eastern Germany. It opened 50 branches in the region during the first half of this year and is expected to have 100 operating by the end of the year, with at least another 20 to follow in 1982. Unification of Germany is understood to have expanded Commerzbank's market by 25 per cent. The proposal for cross-share- holdings was first made in 1987, but there have been changes in the top jobs at both banks since then. Most recent was the replacement in May of the aggressive Mr Walter Siepp by Mr Martin Kohlhaussen at the head of the Commerzbank board. In April, only days before Mr Kohlhaussen was named as Mr Siepp's successor, Commerz- bank said a deal on the cross- shareholdings - giving the German bank a 7 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais and the French 10 per cent of Com- merzbank - would be agreed within a week. However, talks subsequently went adrift and there has been speculation for most of the summer that the issue was dead because of clashes in management style and com- mercial strategy. Both banks are expected to make a further statement on the reasons behind the ending of negotiations during a meet- ing of the International Mone- tary Fund in Bangkok next month."

   "text_content" : "TOTAL, the French state-controlled oil leader, yes- terday reported a 40 per cent increase in profits for the first half of the year, higher than most analysts had expected, writes William Dawklins in Paris. Net profits rose to FFr3.6bn, ($600m) from FFr2.57bn in the same period of 1990. However, earnings per share rose less steeply, by 33 per cent, because of an increase in the number of shares in issue after Total absorbed its investment arm, Omnium Financier de Paris. Officials said earnings improved across all sectors, including refining, distribu- tion, chemicals, oil and gas. The group will publish more details on September 19, when the board is due to agree the full results."

Net profit declined to Fl45m ($23m) from Fl 49.8m in the same period of 1990. The com- pany said it would pay an interim dividend of F13.50, down from Fl 4.25 in the corre- sponding period last year, but added that it would maintain its full-year dividend at F1 8 per share. The net rental income was up 11 per cent in the period, due to rent increases and new additions to the property pirt- folio. However, income from other investments fell. Overall, investment income showed a small rise of F1 3.2m to Fl 111.2m. This increase was more than offset by a F16.6m rise in net interest charges to Fl 55.1m, reflecting the expan- sion of the company's property portfolio, mainly in the Nether- lands, Belgium and France. Wereldhave, which made a successful hostile bid for Peachey Properties of the UK in 1988, said property markets in the UK and the US remained under pressure in the first half. Roughly one-third of the com- pany's investments are in the UK, with a further 15 per cent in the US.",

Oly some 29 per cent of jut over SFrlbn ($8m) In nsecured.leandings to Omni Holding, the parent company, is likely to be recov- ered, Coopers & Lybrand, Basle, the court-appointed administrators, said yesterday. Even that depends on Omni shareholdings being sold at higher prices than their cur- rent stock market values, on the co-operation of banks with secured loans and on the unravelling of some legal nice- ties. The 26 creditors of Omni Beteiligungen, a subsidiary, stand to get back 33 per cent. Together, the holding com- pany and its subsidiary had total debts of SFr2.2bn against assets of SFr661m. The 28.8 per cent cover for Omni Holding's unsecured creditors emerges from the administrators' forecast for an administered liquidation. Under a worst scenario, credi- tors would recover only 13 per cent; they would obtain 48 per cent under the best forecast. Banque Paribas heads the list of more than 70 creditors with SFr244m in loans, of which, however, only SFr8.8m is unsecured. The Brussels branch of Japan's Long Term Credit Bank has outstanding claims of SFrl40m. Mr Frans Muller, head of the Coopers & Lybrand team, yes- terday underlined the entan- glement of cross-holdings, lendings and guarantees it had uncovered. He also highlighted personal transactions by Mr Rey and his directly-held com- panies with Omni Holding which, he said, had cost the parent company SFr388m in loss provisions. Mr Rey declared himself insolvent before the Zurich bankruptcy court on Tuesday. According to Coopers & Lybrand he has refused to recognise a SFr440m debt to the Omni group. Omni Holding had seen the value of its holdings collapse by some SFrl.6bn from the end of 1989, Mr Miller said.",

   "text_content" : "By Ronld van do Krol in Amsterdam PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has appointed an Amer- ican from Hewlett-Packard, as head of technology, and replaced the head of its poorly- performing consumer electron- ics division. The changes, part of a wide- ranging management reorgani- sation, are the latest stage in the attempt by Mr Jan Tim- mer, the new president, to shock the company out of years of underperformance. The appointments are the first board-level changes since Mr Timmer assumed his post in July 1990. The appointment of Dr Frank Carrubba, head of corpo- rate research and development at Hewlett-Packard, has great symbolic significance in an organisation that has always prided itself on the strengths of its home-grown technology. Dr Carrubba, 54, worked in research and engineering at IBM for 22 years before moving to Hewlett Packard in the early 1980s. He becomes Philips' executive vice-president responsible for technology. Philips played a key role in the invention of the audio cas- sette, the video cassette recorder and the compact disc. The blame for, Philips' failure to capitalise quickly on its breakthroughs has usually been placed on its marketing, rather than its technology. The transfer of Mr Thierry Meyer, the head of the con- sumer electronics division, to new responsibilities for Euro- pean affairs reflects Mr Tim- mer's drive to make executives directly accountable for the profits of the businesses they run. Consumer electronics, the group's largest division, saw operating results drop by 40 per cent in the first half. The new head of consumer electronics is Mr Henk Bodt, already a member of the group management committee. He will retain responsibility for the company's computer chips activities! Mr Alain LIvy, a Frenchman who is president of Philips' 80 per cent-owned recorded music subsidiary PolyGram, also joins the board. As with Dr Carrubba, he succeeds an exec- utive who is approaching retirement. The appointment of Mr Lvy reflects Philips' desire to com- bine its own expertise in \"hard- ware\" such as compact disc players and video cassette players with \"software\" pro- duced by record companies such as PolyGram. Consumer electronics are vital to Philips' hopes and strategy for the 1990s. The divi- sion is responsible for a num- ber of key projects such as high definition television and the digital compact cassette. Jan Timmer: attempting to shock company",

   "text_content" : "By NIkki Talt in New York UNION Pacific, one of the largest US railroad companies, yesterday announced it would take a $870m pre-tax charge against its third-quarter earn- ings, primarily to cover the cost of labour agreements and raising productivity in its rail- road business. Known as the railroad which opened up the West in the 1890s, the company said it expected between 3,000 and 4,000 redundancies over the next three to five years as it introduces the labour agree- ments. Last year, the company employed an average of 43,000 people. Cost savings over a similar period could amount to about $300m. It also plans to sell or abandon up to 7,100 miles of lightly-used lines, out of a total 33,800 miles, to avoid mainte- nance and capital costs. The moves follow a pact hammered out between the industry's management and its unions - and implemented with help from Congress. As a result, Union Pacific's action is likely to be followed by other companies in the sector. The one-off charge reduces to about $575m after-tax. Yesterday's announcement was combined with news of a two-for-one scrip issue and an increase in the quarterly divi- dend rate from 62% cents to 68 cents ahead of the share split. The net result was to push the shares $2% higher, at $89. Union Pacific said that of the overall charge, about 85 per cent, or $492m after-tax, related to the railroad division. New working practices - including a reduction in the size of train crews - are being introduced after negotiations between the railroad's management and the sector's numerous unions. The company said that labour productivity, in terms of gross ton miles per employee, had already improved by 80 per cent over the past five years. The rail- road business, which spreads westwards from the Mississippi river, made an operating profit of $900m last year.",

   "text_content" : "By John Burton in Stockholm THE TWO Swedish banks that last week took majority control of Bricom, the UK industrial conglomerate, say they have no immediate plans to sell their shareholdings or parts of the concern. Nordbanken and Skandina- viska Enskilda Banken acquired ownership of Bricom after its main shareholder, the Swedish financier Mr Erik Pen- ser, defaulted on bank loans made to his companies. Yggdrasil, Mr Penser's pri- vate investment company, and -Gamlestaden, his finance com- pany, each acquired one-third of Bricom in June 1990, with the rest held by the US-based financier Alexander Vik, in a Â£337.5m ($567m) deal. Bricom, created as the indus- trial division of British & Com- monwealth in 1987, was sold a year later to a management buy-out group before being taken over by Rochfield. Bricom includes Bristow Helicopters, Steels Aviation Services and specialised busi- ness service operations as well as hotels and apartments in the Canary Islands. When Mr Penser defaulted on his bank loans last week, Nordbanken took control of Yggdrasil, while Gamlestaden fell into the hands of a 14-bank consortium led by SEBanken. \"We have full confidence in the Bricom board and see no reason why we should quickly dispose of our shares,\" said an executive with Nordbanken, which helped finance Mr Pen- ser's takeover of Bricom. SEBanken officials admit they know little about Bricom and have not yet made an examination of the company's prospects. Although the banks are planning eventually to sell their shares in Bricom and other companies they acquired from Mr Penser, they have decided to wait until market conditions improve for the dis- posal of assets. The Swedish government has given the banks permis- sion to keep control of Mr Pen- ser's companies until the end of 1993 and an extension is pos- sible. Swedish banks are not allowed to have stakes in industrial companies, except in cases involving bankruptcy.",

In last year's quarter, the company recorded after-tax restructuring and divestiture charges of $301.6m. Excluding these charges, earnings per share were up 37 per cent.

Net earnings rose to C$261m (US$229m), or 77 cents a share, in the three months to July 31, from C$230m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. While income from domestic business slumped by a third to C$113m, the contribution of interna- tional operations almost tre- bled to C$148m. Return on equity was unchanged at 16.1 per cent, while return on assets rose to 0.8 per cent from 0.74 per cent. The recession in Canada has forced Royal to raise its loan- loss provisions to C$155m from C$l00m a year earlier. The bank said. economic recovery in Canada was likely to be \"slow and uneven\", with many borrowers remaining in difficulty. Non-performing loans stood at C$1.86bn on July 31, a small drop from the previ- ous quarter. * Falling interest rates lifted earnings of the Bank of Nova Scotia to a new record in the latest quarter, despite a dou- bling of loan loss provisions. Net earnings rose to C$164.6m, or 73 cents a share, in the three months to July 31 from C$120.4m, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Net interest income jumped by 36 per cent to C$656.8m. Bad-debt provisions jumped to C$105m from C$57.5m, but the bank reported that its port- folio of non-performing loans, at C$1.47bn on July 31, was slightly lower than it had been three months earlier. The bank expects to set aside C$370m to cover loan losses for the year, up from its estimate of C$330m three months ago."

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, the California-based energy com- pany, yesterday announced plans to sell its 51 per cent stake in IBP, the largest beef and pork processor in the US, through a $860m rights issue to Occidental shareholders. The move is the latest by Occidental to cut its heavy debt load and rationalise its interests following the death last December of Dr Armand Hammer, the chairman who built the business into a lead- ing US corporation. Dr Hammer bought IBP at the start of the 1980s and sold a 49 per cent stake to the pub- lic for $447m in 1987. How- ever, despite IBP's poor profit- ability - it made $50m last year on $lObn of sales - he was reluctant to dispose of the remainder. This was possibly because the subsidiary's huge revenues allowed Occidental to it to be numbered among the top 20 US businesses, ranked by sales. Mr Ray Irani, Dr Hammer's successor, put the IBP stake up for sale months ago but clearly failed to get a suffi- ciently attractive bid from a single purchaser. Mr Irani said the proceeds of the rights offer, net of taxes and expenses, together with the resulting deconsolidation of IBP's $500m of long-term debt, would allow Occidental to cut its debt by $760m. This, together with the group's other asset disposals, meant that in the first nine months of its two-year restructuring programme Occidental would have achieved 85 per cent of its $3bn debt reduction goal. The rights issue, underwrit- ten by First Boston and Don- aldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, involves the offer to share- holders of 24m IBP shares at $15 a share. IBP's shares closed at $19, down $% yesterday afternoon, before the Occidental announcement.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Cane SUN Microsystems, the fast-growing US workstation manufacturer, yesterday raised the temperature of the \"Unix wars\" which have divided the global computer industry. The group unveiled new operating software for business computers which it hopes to establish as an indus- try standard. The move marks a long-ex- pected attempt to broaden its market beyond the traditional scientific workstation area to personal computers and the business desktop. International Computers (ICL), the UK-based subsidiary of the Japanese Fujitsu com- pany, has collaborated with Sun's software division, Sun- Soft, in developing the soft- ware, called Solaris. Other computer companies which endorse Sun's initiative include CompuAdd, Solbourne, Tatung and Toshiba. Software companies which have agreed to develop programs to run under Solaris include Lotus Development, Oracle, Word Perfect and Software AG. A standard operating system for small and medium comput- ers offers users lower costs and the ability to connect com- puters from different manufac- turers in networks. Unix, developed by AT&T, has emerged as the operating system of chokce, with about omn users worldwide, but each manufacturer has developed a separate version, destroying hopes of a world standard. The industry has polarised around two groups of Unix developers, Unix Interna- tienal, including Sn and ICL, and the Open Software oban- dation (OS) ncadin IBM. OSS has recently copleted its own versin of Unix, OSS1, hut the situation is confsed by the exencei of IB3s Unix Other groups are emergig, nacilg the AC3 cosortlum, which takes l Co1pa, Miro- Mot and the Santa Crus Opera- thm.",

   "text_content" : "R John Major, the British prime minis- ter, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday to find busi- ness leaders far more upbeat about the colony's prospects than they had been as recently as three months ago. Confidence has risen sharply after July's agreement on Hong Kong's new airport project. Business is relieved that uncer- tainty has been removed and optimistic that Hong Kong and China can develop a better relationship. With six years left until Hong Kong's return to China, the colony is set to strengthen its role as the sinan- cial and trading centre for southern China, that country's most developed region. Spending on the HK$98.6bn (US$12.7bn) airport and related infrastructure should underpin Hong Kong's economic growth into the next century. A labour shortage may add to inflation, but the main economic benefits of the new airport are expected to accrue after it opens, due in 1997. On Tuesday, the same day as Mr Major signed the airport accord, Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Beijing China International Trust and Investment Corporation, one of the most aggressive Chinese state corporations, announced a recommended HK$6.94bn takeover of Hang Chong, one of the largest unlisted compa- nies in Hong Kong. The takeover is significant because it gives Citic Pacific a meaningful underlying busi- ness. Hang Chong has trading and car distribution operations and investments in Asia and North America. Until now, Citic Pacific and its immediate Hong Kong exports HK$bn 400o ...mcpos ..... Reoexpofs / 300 100' 0 1985 86 87 88 89 90 91 llshai S r:Mon oono Ownuimnt holding company Citic (Hong Kong) only held strategic minority stakes in important Hong Kong companies such as Cathay Pacific Airways and Hongkong Telecom. Citic Pacific's bid was wel- comed in Hong Kong as evi- dence that China is prepared to invest in the colony. The com- pany also has plans to become the first Chinese \"hong\", or trading conglomerate, and wants to be a constituent stock in the Hang Seng Index. China seems intent on running Hong Kong in the same way as Britain has, as a colony. It therefore wants to control key sectors of the economy. Last year, Citic (Hong Kong) bought a 20 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom from Cable & Wireless. Although the deal ensured Hongkong Telecom's future, it was seen as a deal between Hong Kong's old and new colonial masters. This has implications for competition in Hong Kong. Because of China's stake in the company, it raises doubts about whether Hongkong Telecom's monopoly for international telecommuni- cations will be opened up to competition when the franchise runs out in 2007. Several questions about the approach to 1997 are unanswered. China has gained a say over the Hong Kong economy through the airport agreement, and businessmen are worried about how China will adapt to its new role. There are also serious concerns about the potential for corruption and the risk of the Hong Kong government's legitimacy declining. China's influence over Hong Kong business has been growing for the last 12 years after the country opened to the world. China is the third largest source of foreign investment into Hong Kong, ahead of the UK. Total Chinese investment stands at more than US$10bn. Hong Kong consumers buy goods ranging from petrol to clothing to holidays in Thailand from Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese companies. Hong Kong companies have moved manufacturing into southern China for cheap labour and land and employ 1.5 to 2 million people, according to some estimates. As links with China have grown, Hong Kong's re-exports, which are mainly goods processed in China, have rapidly overtaken purely domestic exports. While businessmen remain hopeful for Hong Kong's future they are nervous of political and other worries. About 70 holding companies have moved legal domicile to places such as Bermuda, and private wealth is also seeking safer havens. Last year, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank became the most important company to leave when it announced a restructuring under a London holding company. Bank of China, which holds more than 25 per cent of Hong Kong's deposits, has expanded its influence in recent years and is believed to have ambitions to be a note issuer. Corruption is expected to increase as Hong Kong's capitalistic lifestyle tempts poorly-paid Chinese executives. Chinese corporations are widely believed to have used privileged information about the airport agreement to insider trade on the Hong Kong stock market ahead of the announcement. China's preference for governing through committees may also slow Hong Kong's ability to make quick decisions.",

   "text_content" : "By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco SHARES in Centocor, the US biotechnology group, rose sharply yesterday after its drug, Centoxin, won the back- ing of an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administra- tion. The panel recommended Centoxin, a monoclonal anti- body, as a treatment for sepsis, a deadly condition caused by bacterial infections. The deci- sion could launch Centocor, of Pennsylvania, to the top ranks of the biotechnology pharma- ceuticals business. Centocor's share price rose quickly to $41% from a Tues- day close of $37%. The stock has gaining 25 per cent this week. Xoma, a competing Calif- ornia biotech company which has developed a similar drug known as E5, received a blow at the same FDA panel hear- ings. Panel members said they were not yet ready to reach a decision on recommending E5. Xoma's stock price fell sharply to $15%, down 23 per cent. The FDA must still take a final decision on approval of the drugs, but typically follows the recommendations of its advisory committees. Both drugs represent a potential breakthrough in the treatment of \"gram-negative\" bacterial infections which can lead to septic shock. Such infections kill an estimated 70,000 people each year. Analysts estimate the drugs will have combined annual sales of $750m by the mid- 1990s.",

   "text_content" : "VARITY, the diversified automotive and farm equip- ment group which recently moved its head office from Canada to the US, has suffered its second consecutive quar- terly loss, but has raised hopes of a patchy recovery, writes Bernard Simon. Despite earlier predictions of a return to profitability by mid-1991, Varity, now based in Buffalo, New York state, posted a loss of US$7.6m, or 49 cents a share, in the three months to July 31, compared with a profit of US$33.6m, or 99 cents, in the corresponding period of last year. All figures have been restated to conform with US accounting principles. The per- share earnings reflect a recent one-for-10 reverse share split, which was designed to enhance Varity's image in the US investment community, as was the move to Buffalo. Revenues slid by 13 per cent to US$829.5m, with declines in each of the main operating divisions, namely automotive parts, farm and industrial machinery and diesel engines. Nonetheless, the group's sales in the latest quarter were 22 per cent ahead of the previous three months, and the loss was narrowed from US$37.3m. Massey-Ferguson, the farm- equipment maker, saw sales tumble by 19 per cent to US$291m, reflecting the unre- mitting slump in the interna- tional farm machinery market. Although Mr Victor Rice, the chairman, has repeatedly tar- getted debt-reduction as the group's highest priority, Var- ity's long-term debt grew to US$871.2m on July 31, from $793.1m six months earlier. Mr Rice said: \"We are detect- ing signs of improvement, although so far they have been neither emphatic nor consist- ent.\"",

   "text_content" : "FORD-WERKE, the German subsidiary of Ford of the US, suffered a 28 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the first half of the year, despite a 14 per cent increase in turnover, writes Kevin Done. According to a mandatory disclosure by Ford-Werke of its first-half figures in the official Federal Gazette, pre-tax profits fell to DM517m ($297.1m) from DM722m in the corresponding period a year ago, while turn- over rose to DM11.9bn from DM10.4bn. The company blamed the decline in pre-tax profits on its high level of capital invest- ment and heavy spending on new product research and development. Ford-Werke said it had also suffered from a jump in labour costs and falling sales in key European export markets. The weaker exports could not be fully compensated by good domestic results, which had been fuelled by the surge in new car demand in unified Ford-Werke's group net profit in the whole of last year fell to DM269.7m from DM3W82m in 1989, while group turnover rose to DM20.75bn fom DM1981bn."

Seagram reported operating profit of $120m for the three months to July 31 after the spe- cial charge, against $150m a year earlier. Sales fell 2.4 per cent to $1.38bn from $1.41bn.

   "text_content" : "R Shin Yun Sik, pres- Ident of Dacom, one of the participants in the break-up of the South Kor- ean telecommunications monopoly, is about to experi- ence the costs and benefits of industry liberalisation. His company is preparing to launch its international tele- phone service and break the monopoly of government- owned Korea Telecom. At the same time, however, Dacom's own monopoly over the provi- sion of value-added telecommu- nications services has been brought to an end. The new opportunities pres- ented to Dacom, and the pros- pect of competition in its exist- ing businesses, are part of the government's plans to reform the Korean telecommunica- tions sector. Along with the liberalisation of long-distance telephone calls and the open- ing of the value-added network (Van) market, mobile telecom- munications will be removed from a monopolist. The intention is to upgrade the quality and range of ser- vices available to Korean con- sumers through the introduc- tion of competition. This is deemed particularly necessary in the hitherto neglected areas of value-added networks and mobile communications. The competition, however, will come \"Korean style\". Korea Telecom will maintain, at least initially, its 34 per cent stake in Dacom, its new com- petitor. The rest of the shares are held by what appears an honour list of Korea's largest Dacom business groups. \"We think of Korea Telecom as a big brother,\" says Mr Shin. \"We have a family concept of com- petition based on goodwill between two competitors.\" Younger brother or not, Dacom has been mapping out strategies with which to win a slice of the overseas call mar- ket from Korea Telecom. Part of the strategy is to offer cost incentives. According to Dacom, the company will charge about 10 per cent less for calls to the US, Hong Kong and Japan, the first areas it will be allowed to service. Mr Shin agrees that lower charges are not enough. \"If you look at international examples such as the establish- ment of Mercury in the UK and the introduction of new compa- nies in Japan, then, even with tariff cuts of between 15 and 20 per cent, they have been restricted to less than 30 per cent of the market.\" The answer, he believes, is to upgrade services. Dacom will, for example, use its expe- rience as a value-added net- work provider to offer such sea- tures as immediate details of the cost of international calls. Not that the introduction of competition in the interna- tional voice market is likely to produce losers. The Korean market for overseas calls has been enjoying steady growth and, as in the UK and Japan, Is expected to be further stimu- lated by the introduction of a new carrier. As a result, Dacom forecasts that it will achieve 28m inter- national calls in 1992, about 25 per cent of the market. By the end of the following year, it expects to increase the number to 33m calls and its market share to 30 per cent. As Dacom eats into Korea Telecom's share of the overseas market. however, it will be sending off competition from new entrants to the domestic market for val- ue-added networks. Such networks, ranginga om databases and data processing to electronic mail and message handling services, have been slow to develop in Korea. \"Progress has been disappoint- ing so far,\" says Mr Shin. With the introduction of new competitors from Korea and from overseas, the market is expected to grow rapidly. Dacom forecasts that the total market for VANs will increase by over 20 per cent this year to Won 137.5bn ($187.3m). The fastest growing areas are expected to be electronic mail and credit card information systems. \"The entry of new competi- tors will be quite challenging,\" said Mr Shin. \"But we are now changing ourselves to adapt to the new environment and I believe that we will be able to survive through the introduc- tion of new products.\" Dacom believes its strengths lie in its expertise in comput- ers and software. It points to an information system, devel- oped for the Olympic Games, held in Seoul in 1988, whichis being studied by Barcelona, the next Olympic host, as evi- dence of its ability to develop new systems. What is most important, argues Mr Shin, is a change in attitude. \"We are no longer in a monopolistic situation,\" he says. \"We have to change the way we think.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Barbara Durr in Chicago THE CHICAGO Board of Trade has postponed the launch of its. innovative new insurance futures. The contracts had been scheduled to begin trad- ing on October 1, but CBOT officials now say they will not be ready until mid-1992. The exchange has had more trouble than it expected in win- mniage regulatory approval for ,,the contracts. It has had to seek approval not only from the Commodity Futures Trad- ing Commission, the US futures industry regulator, but, because insurance is regulated at the state level, from state insurance commissioners. The CBOT is engaged in what looks a normal exchange of questions and answers with the CFTC, but dealing with state insurance commissioners is proving trickier than antici- pated. Commissioners are in some cases elected officials and in others appointed by the state governor. With recent election turnover in commissioners, contacts have been inter- rupted, says Mr Les Rosenthal, the CBOT board member in charge of the insurance futures. This has not helped resolve an important issue for the state commissioners regarding how to treat the futures on a company's balance sheet. But the CBOT still hopes to have its targeted three states, Calif- ornia, Illinois and New York, on board soon. Another reason for the delay of the new contracts is that the CBOT has had difficulty round- ing up the needed 10 compa- nies to participate in the index of policies that will be the basis of the contract. Only one company has signed on so far, though Mr Rosenthal claims he will be able to announce partic- ipation by several significant insurance companies within 30 days.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London MOODY'S Investor's Service, the US credit rating agency, has decided to review for possi- ble downgrade the triple-A credit ratings of four sterling mortgage-backed bond issues. The rating agency said that the review of the bond issues was prompted by a review for possible downgrade of Eagle Star Insurance, a subsidiary of BAT Industries. Eagle Star provides insur- ance cover to the bond issues which protects bondholders against loss in the event of widescale default on the under- lying mortgages. Eagle Star is currently rated triple-A, but could not provide triple-A insurance to the bond issues if this top rating was lost. The mortgage lenders which issued the bonds yesterday offered contrasting reactions to the Moody's decision. The Mortgage Corporation said that it had already put in place stand-by lines of insur- ance with a top-rated US insur- ance company to defend the triple-A credit rating of its mortgage-backed bond issues. Two TMC bond issues totalling Â£750m have been put under review by Moody's. National Home Loans said that it had made no decision on whether to upgrade its insurance cover. An official said that the market impact of a downgrade would be limited in any case. The company's CMS No 4 Â£200m bond issue is being reviewed by Moody's. A Â£106m deal from Bear Steams Mortgage Securities is also under review for down- grade. The Moody's review is the lastest hiccup for the sterling mortgage-backed bond market this year, at a time when mort- gage defaults in the UK hous- ing market are running at a record level. In January, the Bank of England announced that banks would have to double the amount of capital they set aside against holdings of mort- gage-backed bonds. In June, National Home Loans arranged emergency lines of credit with banks to head off a liquidity crisis as depositors withdrew funds in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International."

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb in London and Karen Zagor In New York THE BANK of England's base rate cut yesterday morning sparked a rise in short-dated UK government bonds and index-linked gilts, but left long- dated gilts lower on the day. GOVERNMENT BONDS The half-percentage point cut in the base rate to 10.5 per cent took the gilt market by surprise, and was taken as a sign that the government may be considering an autumn gen- eral election. Traders said a cut in the base rate had not been expec- ted until September 13 at the earliest, when the August RPI figures are expected to show a sharp fall in the rate of infla- tion from 5.5 per cent in July. Short-dated gilts gained slightly, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1996 rising J to trade at 1001t by late afternoon. How- ever, long-dated gilts fell back sharply, reflecting concern over the speed of the base rate cut. The benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell to 1121 from its opening of 1136, flat- tening the yield curve slightly. Index-linked gilts, which are often viewed as a hedge against political uncertainty by investors, rallied by almost a full point as the base rate cut fuelled speculation of an early general election. * GERMAN government bonds fell back on wage demand con- cerns, wiping out early gains. News that Germany's power- ful engineering workers union, LG. Metall, is pushing for a 10 per cent pay increase at Volk- swagen's plants led to worries about the forthcoming wage negotiations. Traders said the market was worried that a high wage set- tlement could push up infla- tion and force the Bundesbank to raise interest rates again. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 85.20, reached a high of 85.31 and fell back to 85.01 by late afternoon. * JAPANESE government bonds reached new highs on expectations of an imminent cut in the Official Discount Rate, but fell later to close slightly up on the day. The benchmark JGB futures contract rose to a new high since January 1990 of 98.47, while the yield on the bench- mark No 129 bond, which opened at 6.29 per cent, reached 6.265 before closing at 6.28 in Tokyo. *US TREASURIES opened on a firm note but soon started drifting lower yesterday in thin trading in the absence of sig- nificant economic data. In late trading, the Trea- suries benchmark 30-year bond was down A at 1001, yielding 8.05 per cent. The two-year note was '/ higher for a yield of 6.29 per cent. The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system by arranging overnight repur- chase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 6% per cent. The open market opera- tion was widely expected and did not indicate a change in policy, given that Fed funds were considerably above the Fed's perceived target of 5'/ per cent. The market's attention is now firmly fixed on tomor- row's US employment report for August, which may indi- cate the direction of monetary policy in the coming weeks. It seems unlikely, however, that the Fed will ease on the data unless the employment num- bers are surprisingly weak.",

   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan BANCA NAZIONALE del Lavoro (BNL), the state-owned Italian bank, yesterday received the green light to change to a joint stock com- pany, opening the way to a revaluation of its fixed assets. Celebrations over the change, which the bank hopes will distance it from the 19869 scandal over unauthorised Iraqi letters of credit, have been clouded by friction over Federconsorzi, the collapsed Italian farm services group. BNL has aroused consider- able hostility in international banking circles following its refusal to take responsibility for L240bn in foreign loans to Agrifactoring, a factoring com- pany linked to Federconsorzi. The BNL group owns 50 per cent of Agrifactoring. Some of Agrifactoring for- eign creditors are reportedly planning to use BNL's new sta- tus to trigger default clauses in loans to BNL, which would become immediately repayable.",

   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan in Milan A MILAN court should decide within the next five days on the case brought by Misafin, the small Italian finance hose forced into liquidation last week, against Banq Daumnil Lebli (Snisse), the financial institution controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedettl. Misafin wants to sequester assets of up to L2Obn ($15.26m) from Dumdnil Lebld, which last month Informed Swiss legal authorities it was the victim of an alleged L1OObn fraud involving missing Ital- ian equities. Duminl hLebl bas rejected the claim by Misafin and two Italian stockbrokers that it held the shares as part of a repurchase agreement. Misafln and the brokers had demanded the return of the shares in time for the Milan bourse's scheduled settlement last month. Dumdnil Lebld's decision, backed by Swiss magistrates, not to return any stock trig- gered the forced insolvency of Misafin and the two brokers and the postponement of the settlement day. August settlement is now expected either this Friday or next Monday, according to bourse authorities. Separately, in Canada, SIP International, the quoted com- pany which has become indi- rectly involved in the affair, announced the resignations of Mr Riccardo Mortara and Mr Andrea Soave. The two have been associ- ated with Dominion Trust, the company controlled by Mr Roberto Caprioglio, the Italian financier at the heart of the affair. SFP also said it was plan- ning a C$18.8m private place- ment in order to improve the capital position of Societ6 Financire Privde, the Swiss financial institution in which it has an 80 per cent stake. Mr Simon Rosenfeld, SFP International's president, con- flrmed Dominion Trust, which is not linked to the Canadian trust company of the same name, owned C$1.5m in war- rants in the company, giving it a stake in excess of 10 per cent if converted. However, he said no warrants had so far been exercised. '",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London THE UK Office of Fair Trading has decided not to pursue fur- ther its initial \"polite inqui- ries\" into new issue syndica- tion practice in the Eurobond market. The OFT wrote to seven leading Eurobond firms in July: Credit Suisse First Bos- ton, Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, J.P. Morgan Securi- ties, Nomura International, Paribas Capital Markets, Mor- gan Stanley International and UBS Phillips & Drew. Yesterday, the UK competi- tion watchdog said replies had now been received. The OFT said the replies were satisfac- tory and that it did not believe there was sufficient grounds for further action under restrictive trade practices legis. lation. The OFT wrote to the firms asking them for information about new methods of syndi- cating bond issues which have been introduced into the inter- national bond market over the past two years. It also asked for an explanation of press reports that senior representatives of the seven had been meeting informally to discuss both syndication techniques and levels of fees paid to underwriters for different types of transaction. The International Primary Markets Association (IPMA), the trade organisation of firms involved in underwriting new bond issues, yesterday welcomed the OFT's decision. IPMA publishes recommendations covering the syndication of new new bond issues, which are cleared with the OFT before release. An OFT official said yesterday that the department which contacted the firms In July was not aware at the time that IPMA recommendations are cleared with the OFT. Mr Michael von Bretano, IPMA chairman, said he was \"not surprised to hear the news given that the new issues business in the Euro-capital market has always been highly competitive\".",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London A DAY of frenetic activity in the international bond market yesterday saw substantial new issues in five currency sectors, including the largest Canadian dollar issue yet seen in the Euromarket. Province of Ontario came with a C$750m five-year issue, lead managed by Merrill INTERNATIONAL BONDS Lynch. Omitted from the underwriting group was Deut- sche Bank, which is expected to lead manage a deal for South Africa later this year. Other banks omitted because of South African links included Swiss Bank Corporation. The province has a policy of not dealing with any banks that have helped to provide new loans to South Africa. The deal carries a coupon of 10 per cent and was priced to yield 50 basis points more than Canadian government bonds of the same maturity. This was in line with the secondary market price of bonds issued by Ontario Hydro, which is an agency of the province. Participants reported strong demand from continental Europe and Japan in particu- lar. Supported by this, the yield spread tightened to 48Y. basis points by late afternoon. The Eurodollar sector of the market has been the one nota- ble area starved of supply in recent weeks; yesterday, this was reversed, with three con- trasting deals totalling $850m launched at the seven-year maturity. Chubu Electric Power, one of Japan's high-spending power utilities, came with a $350m deal, lead managed by UBS Phillips & Drew, and priced to yield 53 basis points over US Treasury bonds. The utilities have been very heavy borrowers in their domestic market but less active in the Euromarket. Moreover, the companies are regarded more favourably by international investors than a few years ago and are strong credits. Chubu has a coveted triple-A credit rating from Moody's Investors Service and an AA+ rating from Standard & Poor's. The deal saw strong demand, primarily from institutional investors, and the yield spread tightened to 51 basis points by the close. Daimler Benz North Amer- ica and Exxon Capital, two highly-rated and respected cor- porate names, came with $250m deals at the same matu- rity but aimed primarily at retail investors. The deals, lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Mar- kets and Swiss Bank Corpora- tion respectively, both carry a coupon of 8 per cent. However, Daimler Benz came at a yield spread of 43 basis points over US Treasury securities, against just 30 basis points for Exxon. SBC said the lower yield on the Exxon paper was justified by the higher triple-A credit rating of the borrower and the rarity of its visits to the Euro- market. Exxon has not bor- rowed in Eurodollars for two years. Supply in the sterling sector continued, with Finland launching a Â£200m seven-year deal lead managed by S.G. Warburg. Finland has been a heavy borrower in recent weeks and is viewed by many investors as having declining credit quality. However, sover- eign borrowers in Eurosterling are rare and participants in the deal reported good demand from continental European investors. The bonds carry a coupon of 10% per cent and were priced to yield 30 basis points more than UK government bonds, a yield spread which held during the day. * ANZ Bank has won the man- date to syndicate a $50m loan for the Rice Export Corpora- tion of Pakistan. The loan will be guaranteed by the State Bank of Pakistan and will be used to finance a three-year programme of rice exports from Pakistan. The borrower is paying one percentage point above the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the first year, after which the lending banks have the option of lending for a fur- ther one or two years.",

   "text_content" : "By Karen Fossil In Oslo NORWAY IS ready to clear the way for exports of UK North Sea gas through the Norwegian Norpipe pipeline as discussions centre on tariffs for the use of the transport system. This could also remove obstacles to Norwegian gas making its way to Britain, in a separate deal signed in April. Earlier this year the two coun- tries became embroiled in a dispute over the export of 600bn cubic feet of recoverable gas reserves to Germany from two UK North Sea fields, known as the J-block. The UK sought to link the export plans to Norway's long-standing wish to sell large quantities of gas to Britain from the mid- 1990s. In April Britain's National Power signed a deal with Stat- oil, the Norwegian state oil company, for gas supplies to fuel 1,300 megawatts of com- bined cycle gas turbines over 15 years. The deal, thought to be worth Â£150m, is for supply of 2.2bn cu m of gas a year. According to the Reuters news agency, Mr Colin Moyni- han, the UK energy minister, said yesterday in Aberdeen that his department hopes to rule shortly on those export plans. The terms of the National Power/Statoil deal contain a clause that requires the com- pany to secure a gas import allowance from British authori- ties by the end of October, or it will become void. Statoil says it is currently assessing the most cost effective way of delivering gas through the Frigg pipeline, which runs between the Norwegian North Sea Frigg gas field and St Ser- gus in Scotland. Phillips Petroleum Norway is understood to have offered J-block partners capacity in the Norpipe line from 1995 for 6m cubic metres a day. The tariff discussions are understood to be based on a so-called \"total tariff' applica- tion in which J-block gas, before making its way to Ger- many, would be processed through Phillips Norway's Eko- fisk field centre. \"Capacity has been offered, but commercial discussions on the transport tariffs need to be concluded,\" an official close to the negotia- tions said. The British Government may now be more open to approving the National Power/ Statoil deal since Norway seems prepared to clear the export of UK gas to Germany through the Norwegian Nor- pipe line.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Agriculture Staff THE EUROPEAN Community's apple and pear crops are expected to be 25 to 30 per cent lower than last year, mainly due to inclement weather. Latest estimates suggest that the 1991-92 apple harvest will fall by 30 per cent to 5.7m tonnes, compared to last year's 8.2m tonnes, while the pear crop, at 1.8m tonnes, will be 25 per cent lower. According to Agra Europe, the independent agricultural and horticultural intelligence agency, only the UK and Portu- gal will register near normal or above average crops. Overall, it said, \"one would have to go back as far as 1961 to find a season as disastrous as the cur- rent one\". The principal reason for the low crops was adverse weather, with frosts occurring at blossom-time and prolonged unfavourable weather after- wards, which resulted in poor coverage, smaller fruit sizes, deformed fruit and an increased number of windfalls. According to figures from Prognostruit, the UK, Ireland MC Apple and Poar produton (mllHHon tonn-) AppIM Pears 1991* 5.73 1.87 1990 8.18 2.18 1989 7.77 2.33 19886 8.90 2.60 1987 7.56 2.61 *forcat and Portugal are all expected to have apple crops higher than last year, with the UK's crop, for example, forecast at 366,000 tonnes, against 295,000 tonnes last year. In Germany, France and the Netherlands, for example, apple crops are expected to be, respectively, only 65, 55, and 45 per cent of last year's. Pears present a slightly dif- ferent picture, for while the UK, Greece, Portugal and the Netherlands are all likely to have bigger crops, Germany (including the former East Ger- many), France and Spain will probably produce 54 to 56 per cent less.",

A tense situation at the property following a deadlock in annual wage negotiations prompted the closure, the company said. The point of parity between the two metals was seen at resistance levels, with the market focused on $350 a troy ounce. London cocoa prices ended sharply ahead despite coming under pressure from profit-taking towards the close. The December contract hit a nine-month high of Â£751 a tonne in early trading.

Dealers said the break below $7,800 for three-month metal in the morning prompted further losses during the afternoon session.

   "text_content" : "By David Blackwel AFTEI ONLY eight months of screen trading, the London raw sugar futures market decided yesterday to go back to open outcry tradln. The market Is expected to be back on the floor at Commodity Quay, home of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox), by the end of the year. The raw sugar market switched to Fox's automated trading system on January 11 after a sharp decline in the number of lots being traded under open outcry. The switch was by no meonansnimously backed: an extraordinary general meeting of the exchange a few days earlier saw a resolution calling for an integrated trading floor with pits was defeated by 58 per cent to 42 per cent of the votes. The eahbange, whieh has a smeass- fl screen-traded contract for white hoped that the move would to reverse the fllitn volume. while the white sugar coatract has cotined to trade at snilar vol- mass to last yO (between 900 and laMo lots a day), the verage daily volume for raws In August was only 818 lots, compared with 2,192 lots i Auust last year under open outcry and 4,976 In May. Yesterday's meeting followed a questioauiire which the sugr com- ittee ent out In July eeking the opinions of everyone in the London sugar trade, member of the exchange or not Of 186 sent ouat, about one thirt were returned, with a maiority In favour of a return to floor tradlaing, Mr Murk Blundell, ox chief execu- tive, said. Voting yesterday was not unanl- mous, but a cear majority backed floor trading. Mr BlIndie, a keen advocate of screen trading, said there was no question that the eachange was dis- appointed the move to screens had not improved volumes. But he Isisted that \"It is not a defeat for screen trading\". In April this year Fox suspended its screen-based rubber futures con- tract. The arabica coffee contract launched in March Is only just tick- inl over, while the screen-based rice contract is not trading. Mr Blundell ointed to the coitin- ued success of white sugar - the exchange's firslnt screen-baud contract - and to the base metals index and propety ctracts which are running reasonably well. \"I don't believe that launching lots of contracts damages the image of the exchange,\" he said yesterday. \"The best exchanges have a lot of contracts that fal.\" However, he admitted that taking the sugar market first one way, then another was not especially The Fox board meets on September 26 to approve the necessary expendi- ture of a return to floor trading. It is likely to be a pit system as the space taken by the former ring trading sys- tem is now occupied by the agricul- tural markets which Fox took over from the Baltic Exchange. Further costs will be incurred with the return of screens. Locals, who trade for their own account and were opposed to move to screens, were delighted with yester- day's news. \"We still believe the only way forward is to keep the market on the floor,\" said Mr David Rose. However, one of the attractions of screen trading is its relatively low costs, and analysts yesterday were wondering just how many companies would be prepared to man the new trading floor.",

   "text_content" : "By Victoria Griffith in Sao Paulo THE TASK force formed on Tuesday by President Fern- ando Collor de Mello of Brazil and President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia is set to meet in Rio de Janeiro early next week to define the details of a coffee retention scheme. The two countries plan to present the plan to the Interna- tional Coffee Organisation in London later this month. \"We will offer this as a temporary alternative to an international accord on prices,\" said Mr Suelly Evandro Amarante, president of one of Brazil's largest coffee growers' unions and a member of the National Coffee Council, which will play a key role in the Rio talks. The scheme, by which coffee- producing countries would hold back 10 per cent of their total production from the mar- ket in an effort to boost prices, has won the support of Colom- bia, Brazil, and the major Cen- tral American coffee growers. Financing is still uncertain, however. Mr Jorge Cardenas, presi- dent of the National Coffee Federation of Colombia, said exporters from his country were in advanced talks with American and Colombian banks on funding for the deal. Brazil's financing will come from internal sources. Coffee pioducers here are counting on the newly-released funds of Funcafe, the government agency which offers credit to coffee farmers. This week, the government unfroze Cr$101bn ($225m) of Funcafe funds blocked last year under the anti-inflation Collor Plan. Some $57m has already been offered to coffee growers to finance the current harvest. Producers believe the rest, $168m, could be allotted to the retention scheme.",

   "text_content" : "AMERICAN consumers have not seen a better time to enjoy a juicy steak in quite a while. Retail meat prices are at 18-month lows and are expected to fall further. They have been follow- ing a dramatic dive in the wholesale market, which in recent months has suffered its heaviest fall since 1982. Average weekly prices for live cattle peaked on 29 March at 81.40 cents a lb, dipped as low as 66.28 cents in mid-Au- gust and are now hovering around 67 cents. The 15-cent drop was the largest summer season decline since a 17-cent crash nine years ago. So ended what had been a five-year bull market for the American beef industry. The cattle feeding sector of the industry is estimated to have lost between $550m and $600m in the 15 weeks to August 31, according to Mr Steve Kay, editor of the indus- try newsletter Cattle Buyers Weekly. These losses are put in perspective by comparison with cattle feeders' financial position on May 18 - $180m in the black. Why the market took such a tumble is a matter of contro- versy. At the centre of it is a Denver-based producers organ- isation called Cattle-Fax. Ear- lier tHis year Cattle-Fax ques- tioned figures from the US Department of Agriculture on the number of cattle in feed- lots, saying that, based on returns from its own members, it believed there were some 300,000 fewer cattle in lots than the USDA calculated. It suggested that the demand for beef was set to continue and consequently that prices would not lose more than 6 cents a lb going into the summer, when seasonally plentiful supplies usually bring a price drop. In April Cattle-Fax predicted that prices that month would be in the high range of 81-88 cents a lb and that after the seasonal drop in June and July prices would go back up. The organisation turned out to be wrong about cattle num- bers and about the prospects for prices, which plummeted. But before this was clear Cat- tle-Fax's doubts about the USDA figures had prompted a crisis of confidence regarding the government data among industry analysts, particularly in some influential securities houses. The result of this was that many in the cattle busi- ness were led to believe more optimistic scenarios than real- ity warranted. And based on these misinterpretations of the facts, cattlemen proceeded to keep their animals in feedlots longer. This was to prove a disas- trous mistake. Mr Tom Brink of Cattle-Fax now contends that lower-than- expected demand from Japan has been an important factor in the prices fall. Japan, which accounts for some 70 per cent of US beef exports, has beef in storage and that has pulled down its US imports, said Mr Brink. He blames a buying spree by the Japan's quasi-gov- ernment agency, the Livestock Industry Promotion Council, which stocked up on American beef before it was disbanded 'after Japan lifted its import restrictions on US beef on April 1. But, while exports to Japan have not perhaps expanded at the rate the industry would have liked, they were up by 7 per cent for the January-July period, according to the US Meat Export Federation. Over- all US exports of beef and veal are up by 20 per cent, with impressive export growth in particular to Pacific Rim coun- tries such as Korea and Taiwan, where US beef exports rose by 65 per cent and 66 per cent respectively. US beef exports to Mexico meanwhile jumped 86 per cent in the first half. Some analysts who had kept faith with the USDA figures say slow exports to Japan were not to blame for the deep dip in beef prices and offer a two-fold explanation for the market slump. On the demand side the problem is the US recession, says Mr William Plummer, president of Frontier Risk Man- agement, an introducing bro- ker affiliated with the Lind- Waldock futures firm in Chi- cago. This has caused a signifi- cant drop in beef demand, especially in the hotel, restau- rant and institutional markets, which account for about 40 per cent half of the total of US beef consumption. Compounding the economic difficulties, Mr Plummer contends, has been an attitudinal change regard- ing conspicuous consumption. \"People are just not spending money on high priced steaks,\" he says. Mr Tom Morgan, presi- dent of Sterling Research in Arling- ton Heights, Illinois, adds that for a period the drop off in demand during the last year was masked by military pur- chases for Gulf War troops. His company's data indicating a fall in farm demand tipped him off to the overall demand decline. On the supply side, the story is more complex, but in essence adds up to too many cattle, many at excessive weights, coming to market at the same time. \"The seeds of destruction were laid last summer,\" says Mr Plummer. More cattle than usual at far lighter than nor- mal weights were put on feed- vr raÂ·ur ~Â·uuvrr~ rrrrurr ~u Â·rrry y~y~UÂ·l I~Yb~- lots from July through Septem- ber. Had these cattle been of normal weight, they would have been marketed (that is, sold to a packer) in the period of November through January this year. But the marketings were much fewer than many analysts expected, thus occa- sioning the controversy about the USDA figures. Mr Plummer, Mr Morgan and others who remained faith- fully to the USDA figures say that several factors contrib- uted to the unexpectedly-slow rate of marketings. Foremost was the abnormally light weights at which the cattle were placed in the lots, which meant they took longer than usual to reach the desired weights. Also, there was a bout of severe winter weather, which makes the cattle lose weight and consequently pro- longs their time in the feedlots. A final delaying factor was the widespread use of the growth hormone Finaplex. It is suc- cessful in helping cattle gain weight, but it tends to produce less fat on the animal. Thus, to reach the standard of \"choice\" in American beef gradings, the cattle again had to remain longer in the feedlots. Adding to the problem, cattle placed in feedlots at the start of the year were of abnormally heavy weights, meaning that they would require less time to complete their feeding cycle. By early summer there was a substantial backlog in the feed- lots and cracks were starting to appear in the market's price structure. Cattle feeders tried to withhold their animals to minimise losses from packers. But .packers, aware of the excess supply, steadily lowered their bids. Prices dropped sharply and have stayed down. Yet, many still believe that the current glut will disappear and that prices will return to hover around 80 cents a lb. Mr Plummer begs to differ. While a brief price \"spike\" could occur this winter, given that feedlot placements are currently down markedly, he believes prices are heading lower over the longer term. The only brake on the slide would be a much stronger US economic recovery than is expected. Mr Kay is equally gloomy. \"It's going to be a long, slow, painful recovery for the beef industry,\" he says.",

   "text_content" : "By Roger Davis LAST month the new Accounting Standards Board presented the next major steps in the progression towards tougher UK accounting stan- dards. It explains its mission in the shape of a definitive Statement of Aims, and its authority in a draft Foreword to Accounting Standards. At the same time, it published drafts of the first two chapters of a Statement of Principles. The drafts deal respectively with the objective and the basic characteristics of sinan- cial statements. They represents the beginnings of a conceptual framework, for which many see an urgent need. Still to come are drafts on: the elements mak- ing up financial statements; when to recognise income and costs; and prin- ciples of measurement, presentation and consolidation. These early documents are far from routine. A few seemingly innocuous new words and phrases in the State- ments of Principles may well herald the requirement for a sea change in all companies' attitudes to financial reporting. So anyone who is unhappy with the ASB's language would do well to speak now. The drafts add new terms to the lexicon of the true and fair view: amongst them \"faithful representa- tion\" of the underlying commercial activity and \"neutrality\". They are coupled with an unambig- uous statement that accounts should be free from bias. The ASB says that accounting presentation should not \"influence the making of a decision or judgment in order to achieve a prede- termined result or outcome\". In plain language, it all suggests that putting any sort of gloss on the numbers is out. No one, least of all the ASB, believes that it will ever stop the natural tendency for compa- nies to put a public relations face on their results: \"Everyone else will do it. So must we\" is the prevailing atti- tude. But the ASB's language is clearly designed to kill the philoso- phy, more often espoused by pedlars of creative accounting schemes than by responsible directors, that such schemes are fair game provided that No one, least of all the ASB, believes that it will ever stop the natural tendency for companies to put a public relations face on their results... The ASB's language is designed to kill the philosophy, more often espoused by pedlars of creative accounting schemes than by responsible directors, that such schemes are fair game provided that you remain within the rules. you remain within the rules. As I tell my clients on the receiving end of the marketing of such schemes, it's not just that you will delude your shareholders about your financial position. You as management will delude yourselves. That will be quite as serious a disservice to your share- holders.The complete Statement of Principles appears wordy, but to date contains a lot of commonsense. So far so good. I hope then that the eventual standards themselves will not have so many words. The Ten Commandments are remarkable for their clarity. \"Thou shall not commit adultery\" is so obvious a. command that it doesn't need elaboration. The more you try to define adultery in accounts, the more you will probably encourage the cottage industry in pre- tending that adultery really isn't that at all. In the final analysis, it depends on directors' and auditors' attitudes in upholding the spirit of the stan- dards. Now to some of the other aspects of the ASB's drafts. They say, not sur- prisingly, that accounts should be useful to users in making economic decisions. Who are the users and what decisions do they make? The Statement of Principles recognises that legitimate users include not only investors but employees, lenders, sup- pliers, customers, the government and the public - any stakeholder in the business, if you will. However, it gives primacy to inves- tors on the basis that meeting their needs is likely to meet most of the needs of the other users, insofar as they can be met by general purpose financial statements. That reflects international thinking. It moves away from the traditional view that inves- tors are the only legitimate users of accounts but does not go so far as to accord equal consideration to all users. The statement suggests that investors need information \"to help them determine whether they should buy, hold or sell\". That is in danger of aligning accounts solely with a short- termist attitude to investment. It is at odds with the fashionable view that shareholders should see their holdings not only as a tradable commodity but be encouraged to have- a longer term commitment to compa-. nies. Expressing the objective of sinan- cial statements in terms of relevance to decisions, which by definition relate to the future, means that accounts should have predictive value. The ASB also rightly recog- nises the. crucial role of accounts in Information is of little use unless the reader can be reasonably assured of its truthfulness. The newly released statements con- tain some fighting talk. Of themselves, they will not improve the quality of financial reporting over- night. Unless they become more than mere talk they could actually increase the gap between the expecta- tions of users and prepar- ers of accounts. reflecting past stewardship. A lot has been said elsewhere about the limita- tions of balance sheets, but the bal- ance sheet is, or at least should be, an excellent record of how management has spent its shareholders' funds and therefore on what it needs to earn a return. So predictive value is only one of a \"shopping list\" of characteristics of accounting information set out by the ASB. Others include relevance to users, reliability, reflecting substance and economic reality, completeness, comparability and timeliness. Accounts must be understandable by the reasonably diligent and knowl- edgeable user. These qualities may sound unobjectionable, but they may lead to significant changes in account- ing ractice. Missing from the list of characterise tics is the need for verifiability. Infor- mation is of little use unless the reader can be reasonably assured of its truthfulness.The statements con- tain some fighting talk. Of them- selves, they will not improve the qual- ity of financial reporting overnight. Unless they become more than mere talk they may even increase the gap between the expectations of users and preparers of accounts. The public may assume that imper- sections have been addressed, when in fact there is a long road ahead. How- ever, the statements provide the basis for a shared understanding of what accounts are trying to achieve. They lay the foundation for what the ASB describes as evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. That is as it should be. We should not sacrifice an environment which encourages the majority of companies to follow the spirit for the sake of those who do not. Every indication is that the ASB is proceeding in a work- manlike manner towards ensuring that standards of financial reporting are improved. The ASB should be warmly encour- aged in its endeavours.

Part of this legislation would require \"zero emission vehicles\" (Zev) - cars which do not produce environmentally damaging pol- lutants as a byproduct of com- bustion - to form a small but increasing proportion of car makers' total sales from the late 1990s. The states which now appear likely to follow California's lead include some of the most economically powerful in the country, such as Texas and Ill- inois. The 12, plus California, account for about half the esti- mated 10m new cars sold each year in the US. Against this background, General Motors says it has no choice but to continue to develop electric car technol- ogy. \"We have to have a viable electric car ready to go,\" says John Dabels, director of mar- ket development for GM's elec- tric vehicle programme. In recent weeks GM has become increasingly alarmed by media scepticism about the viability of its Impact electric car programme. Dabels says that there are no longer any big technical obstacles to the car going into production. He rejects reports that the whole project has been put on \"hold\" because of technical and sinan- cial problems. GM is mounting an offensive to convince scep- tics that earlier set-backs have not in any way reduced its determination to bring the vehicle into production. The offensive is well-timed. Several prototype electric cars are to be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show next week. These cars will under- line that, driven by the threat of legislation and by popular \"green\" consumer sentiment, manufacturers are at last pay- ing serious attention to the electric car. BMW, Opel and a joint proj- ect between a Swedish group, Clean Air Transport, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, will all launch their electric models at Franfurt. BMW's El, like GM's Impact, is a purpose-designed \"EV\" (electric vehicle) rather than a converted conventional car, such as the electric version of the new Opel Astra, which is also making its debut at Frank- furt. Officially, BMW describes the El as a \"concept\" car, which is designed to show that it is capable of developing an electric vehicle. In reality, though, El is understood to be as much intended as a produc- tion vehicle as GM's Impact. El, or something close to it, is likely to be on sale in Calif- ornia in 1998 in order to meet the requirements of state law. The El is a four-seater car, built by BMW Technik, a BMW subsidiary. But the El is no \"bargain basement\" alternative to a con- ventional car. It runs on newly developed, high-energy sodium- sulphur batteries. The 200kg battery pack, mounted beneath the rear seats, generates 120 volts and 19,000 watts, power- ing a 32-kilowatt (45bhp) elec- tric motor resting on the rear axle. The main body structure is made of aluminium, with an outer skin of recyclable plastic. In what is a fine example of environmental 'one-upman- ship', BMW says its next step is to make the body out of recycled plastic. The El with an overall length of just over 11 feet - a little longer than a Mini - is as wide and high as BMW's latest 3-series model. BMW, like GM, is aware that that Americans will shun any car that is less comfortable than their existing vehicle; so the El has air conditioning. With low aerodynamic drag, the car can accelerate from standstill to 80km an hour in 18 seconds, has a top speed of 120kph, and in typical driving conditions BMW claims it will travel 155 miles between bat- tery charges. The two main snags are the cost and the eight hours its takes to recharge the battery. The battery pack alone costs DM40,000 (Â£13,605), although this should drop to DM10,000 (Â£3,401) when the batteries are in volume production. Also to be unveiled in Frank- furt is the LA 301, a joint proj- ect by the Swedish group, Clean Air Transport, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The project forms part of the Los Angeles \"electric vehicle initiative\", devised by the city council and state utilities, to put 10,000 electric cars and light commer- cial vehicles on the roads of smog-ridden southern Calif- ornia by 1995. Pilot production of the LA 301 is to start at the end of this year at a new plant in Worth- ing, southern England. The plant is being set up by Inter- national Automotive Design, one of the world's largest vehicle design and engineering consultancies, which carried out development of the LA 301. By early 1992 production should reach 60 units a week, with larger-scale manufactur- ing facilities - depending on demand - planned in the US for 1993. Unlike GM's Impact or BMW's El, the LA 301 is a \"hybrid\", using a small catal- ysed petrol engine in conjunc- tion with lead acid batteries to extend the travelling distance of the vehicle to 120 miles before a battery charge. To comply with California's laws the LA 301 operates in electric mode only in urban traffic. It also has air conditioning. Volkswagen may also unveil the prototype of an electric car at Frankfurt. It is being devel- oped through a joint venture with SMH of Switzerland, maker of the Swatch plastic watches. The car envisaged is smaller than a Mini with a' hybrid drive system claimed to have a travelling range of more than 300 miles. Such activity is regarded by GM as additional evidence that the Impact project should be taken very seriously. \"We realise that there is a lot of scepticism,\" says Dabels. \"But we are wholly committed to the project; we have allo- cated a plant to it [a former Buick facility at Lansing, Michigan] and are now con- verting it to produce Impact - or a car very closely based on it - by the mid-1990s.\" Dabels insists that GM has at no stage formally set a launch date for the cars \"because we don't want to over-promise and under-de- liver\". And he says that the Impact, or a close derivative of it, will be in commercial pro- duction well before California's legislation takes effect in 1998. California's legislation has teeth. It states that by 1998 Zevs must make up 2 per cent of the sales of every manufac- turer selling more than 35,000 cars in the state, rising to at least 10 per cent of annual sales from 2003. Manufacturers which do comply will be barred from selling any cars in the state. Based on sales projec- tions, this means 30,000 Zevs will be sold in 1996, rising to nearly 150,000 a year from 2003. Faced with the demands of such stiff legislation, GM's apparent commitment to Zev technology in general and Impact in particular comes into sharp focus. Even using existing lead acid battery technology, the two- seater Impact will have a trav- elling range of more than 100 miles, based on a. cruising speed of about 55mph, well in excess of that achievable by converted conventional cars. Impact's relatively low weight of 2,200 pounds and the high torque generated by its twin electric motors provides similar acceleration to that of a small sports car. GM is stressing that the elec- tric car cannot be a replace- ment for all conventional cars. Instead, it should be seen as a car for urban use by families which own another vehicle for longer distance driving. One of the tasks facing the industry, says Dabels, is to impress upon the public that different cars have different uses. \"We need to get away from the idea of 'his and her' cars towards a family using whatever car is appropriate for specific trips,\" he says. The question of battery tech- nology, and which \"super-bat- teries\" might emerge, is of vital importance in the longer term - and not just because of their potential for significantly extending travelling range. Several technologies, from sodium sulphur to nickel-iron, are being explored by the US Advanced Battery Consortium, comprising the \"big three\" US car makers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - with US federal government collaboration. In developing Impact, GM is seeking to ensure that it will be able to adapt to whatever battery technology emerges as the best. \"We have got to take the power source out of the competitive equation,\" says Dabels. GM's view is that if custom- ers worry about whether they are buying the right power source, they simply won't buy - in the same way, for exam- ple, that many potential buyers of video recorders held back until the battle between VHS and Sony's Betamax system was resolved."

   "text_content" : "l san appears poised to reap competitive advantage rom a new \"intelligent\" flexible body production system it has developed and is now installing in its car plants. The company, Japan's second largest vehicle maker, says the system Is capable of cutting from one year to less than three months the lead times needed to prepare for the welding and assembly of the body of a new model. However, even the 'intelligent body assembly system' (IBAS) is seen by Nissan as only a stage in its development of a more sophisticated system. This would be capable, according to one of its senior production executives, of producing a vehicle body \"at any time, at any production location and in any volume required\". According to Yoshitada Sekine, Nissan's general manager of production engineering, such a system is still \"some way off\". However, the IBAS systems recently installed in Nissan's plants in Japan, and due to go into operation next year at its Tennessee factory in the US, are seen as a big step forward in the race to develop a greater variety of models over ever-shorter time scales. The rationale of the IBAS system is to replace the massive jigs that normally hold in place the pressed steel panels to be welded into a body. Conventionally, each model requires its own dedicated jig. Such jigs are expensive to make and difficult to change. Nissan's ntellgent Doy assemmly plant m Japan With IBAS, such dedicated jigs are replaced by a compter-controlled one which can be instantly programmed to accommodate the panels of any model In the Nissan line-up. Deployed within a huge steel framework, 85 robots position the body panels while another 16 spot weld the panels together. \"In the past\", says Sekine, \"a model change required modifications of both Jigs and welding robots in accordance with the new production design. Re-tooling took about 12 months. Capital investment was large. Now IBAS allows model changes to be made simply by changing the relevant data in the computers, reducing lead time to two or three months and bringing down the cost of changeover considerably\". IBAS also allows the body production process to be modelled on the computer, thus making it possible to identify potential assembly problems before the design of a body is finalised. Nissan is giving no indication of the possible time-scale for the introduction of an 'ultimate' system - but it is reducing new model introduction times on several other fronts. These include computer simulation of press die stamping operations and the creation of a unified database for die press manufacturing and an automated assembly line for trim and chassis assembly operations.

   "text_content" : "SENTIMENT surrounding the dollar was weak yesterday, but sterling performed well despite a cut In UK interest rates. . The US currency finished towards the top of a narrow range in Europe, but failed to sustain overnight finishing lev- els despite Tuesday's news of a larger than expected rise in the US National Association of Purchasing Managers Index or a strong figure on construction P'he oiar fell despite this bullish economic news, as the depressed undertone was com- pounded by speculation that tomorrow's employment data will cause disappointment. It is generally expected that non- farm payrolls will be shown to have risen by about 50,000 in August, after falling 51,000 in July, but that this may not be strong enough to prevent an easing of the Federal Reserve's monetary stance. At the London close the dol- lar had fallen to DM1.7365 from DM1.7400; to Y135.45 from Y135.95; to SFrl.5240 from SFrl.5270; and to FFr5.9000 from FFr5.9100. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index eased to 66.2 from 66.3. Sterling accepted a cut in UK bank base rates without seri- ous reaction.

Timing of the base rate move caused some surprise, but a rate reduction was generally expected within the next few weeks. Next Friday's data on UK retail prices were seen as providing a likely catalyst for a rate cut, amid speculation that the year-on-year inflation rate will slow to about 4.7 from 5.5 per cent. October's Conservative Party conference was also regarded as a possible time for lower rates. Pressure for the next % point reduction could still build up at that time if the momentum increases up for a general election in November.

   "text_content" : "Wal Strmt A,QUIET day on Wall Street saw US equities move in a nar- rowly mixed range as the mar- ket waited for tomorrow's employment figures for August which should indicate the state of the US economy, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The statistics are often the basis for a change in monetary policy, but it seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will ease unless the figures are exceptionally weak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 9.17 at 3,008.50 on moderate volume of 158.4m shares. Declining issues outpaced those advancing by 1033 to 547. Similar declines were posted by the Standard & Poors 500, 2.18 lower at 389.97 and the New York Stock Exchange composite, off 1.18 at 213.95. On Tuesday, the Dow closed 25.93 lower at 3,017.67. There was active trading in waste management companies for a second day, following gloomy earnings projections from Browning Ferris on Tues- day. Browning Ferris was down $1% at $20/, near its 52-week low of $20'/%, while Waste Management lost $% to stand at $37%. A number of blue chip issues led the New York Stock Exchanges most-active list, including American Telephone & Telegraph, up '% at $39%, PepsiCo, down $% at $31%, and Westinghouse Electric, $'/% lower at $22%. Goodyear Tire jumped $2% to $40% after Salomon Bros iani- tiated research coverage of the stock with a \"buy\" rating. Union Pacific added $2% to ^8a after the railway company said it would take after-tax charges of $575m against earrn- ings this year. In the secondary market, bio- technology issues stood out as the Nasdaq composite eased 2.99 at 517.92. Centocorp climbed $3 to $40%, setting a 52-week high. Heavy trading in the stock was spurred by a Food & Drug Administration panel meeting which voted to recommend approval of the company's drug to treat bacte rial infections, including septic shock. Xoma, which makes a com- peting product, plummeted $5 to $15% after the FDA advisory panel said it would not recom- mend approval of the drug, although it might consider lic- ensing it in the future. Among other active over-the-counter issues, Sun Microsystems rose $% to $81 following reports that the com- puny plans to become a sup- plier of operatlng systems sa- ware. Other software issues lost ground on the reportso Quicksilver tumbled $2% to $11% after posting third quar- ter earnings of 32 cents a share. Although the results were in line with expectations, they were below the 41 cents earned a year ago. STOCK PRICES declined in moderate trading in Toronto led by lower consumer-prod- ucts and gold stocks. According to preliminary data, the composite index slumped 18.02 points to finish at 3,486.84, as declining issues outnumbered advances 324 to 229. Volume was 22,2m shares, up from 15392,000 shares, with a trading value of C$271.7m. Thirteen of 14 stock groups lost ground, led by consumer products, down 1.9 per cent on index. Seagram, the most-heavily weighted stock in the group, slumped 5% to 127%. The gold group fell 1.1 per cent, led by American Barrick, which was off % to 25% after jumping 1% yesterday.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo ARBITRAGE-RELATED selling left the Nikkei average margin- ally lower yesterday, its first loss in five trading days, writes Emiko Tenraono in Tokyo. The index closed 67.11 easier at 22,402.69, after a, high of 22,462.49 in the morning and a low of 2,311.85 in the after- noon.- Volume rose to 350m shares from 320m on dealer activity and continued buying by foreign investors. Declines led advances by 503 to 403, with 207 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.46 to 1,739.69, but in London the ISE/Nikke i80 index gaitied'453 to 3830.97. Share prices failed to respond to the easing of short-term interest rates by the Bank of Japan. The central bank injected more than Y1,000bn into the call money market, and the overnight call rate dropped from 7.5 to 7.28 per cent. Tokyo market professionals felt this might be a sign that a discount rate cut could come earlier than expected. Mr Rus- sell Jones, an economist at UBS Phillips& Drew, said the Bank of Japan's move - before tomorrow's release of the tankan, or quarterly report of business sentiment - suggested that its results could be weaker than the Bank of Japan had expected. While share prices cut some of their afternoon losses on the easing in short-term rates, arbitrage unwinding ahead of next week's September futures' expiry continued to dominate price movements. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, as of August 30, a total of 1.lbn shares worth Y1,176.3bn were held for arbi- trage against stock-index Sep- tember futqres contracts, down 72.1m shares or Y61.9bn from a week earlier. Traders said a rollover of September futures into Decem- ber contracts was noted, and that, while worries over arbi- trage unwinding still t remained, some of the nervous- a ness was receding. t Speculative issues were a actively traded. Kurabo advanced Y74 to Y889 and Kon- c ica Y78 to Y930. Traders I suggested that speculative r groups were commemorating a the death of Mr Susumu Ishii, t the former gangster chairman I known for his extensive stock I investments and who was I involved in the recent stock a scandals. s Large-capital issues eased on a profit-taking, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries losing Y2 to Y723. t In Osaka, the OSE average a added 30.62 at 24,482.78 in vol- I witie of 39.9m shares. The index : move wlit adtlaiatrow rangt;' c but managed to rise for the I fifth consecutive trading day on the back of firm bond r prices. I Shikibo, a fibre maker, t climbed Y35 to Y665 on buying t by individuals. The company I revised its pre-tax profits esti- mate for the current year, c thanks to firm clothing sales. E Roundup ECONOMIC and political con- cerns kept the region's equity 1 markets mostly in a nervous mood yesterday. i TAIWAN reacted to the fail- ure of the central bank to i make a widely expected cut in I its rediscount rate. There were I also worries that the weaken- a ing US dollar. could hurt a export-oriented manufacturers. I The weighted index fell 1 117.33 or 2.5 per cent to t 4,508.26, and turnover from T$26bn to T$23.2bn. Textile a shares, most of them with ties a to the export business, suffered the largest losses. 1 HONG KONG stocks ignored I the visit of UK Prime Minister I John Major, following his I two-day stop in Beijing, the a market feeling that most of the good news was out of the way. i The Hang Seng index slipped a 1.62 to 4,006.45, although turn- I over increased from HK$LO4bn to HK$1.14bn. The downturn was attri- 1 buted to mild profit-taking after three successive advances that had pushed the Hang Seng above the 4,000 level. Citic Pacific, the listed arm of the Beijing-backed China International Trust and Invest- ment Corp, dominated the actives list as it rose 15 cents to HK$1.81 on news that its HK$2bn new issue, launched to pay its share of a consortium bid for Hang Chong Invest- ment, had been oversub- scribed. The stock was suspended on Tuesday. SEOUL advanced in busy trading, although institutional selling pared early gains. Bar- gain hunting lifted the compos- ite index 7.87 to 688.54 in turn- over ofrW6n335bn, itp'from Wonl29bn. Trading was enlivened by rumours that the government would permit securities firms to engage in foreign exchange trading, and that a bank was planning a rights issue. AUSTRALIA was little changed after Tuesday's inter- est rate-inspired rally. The All Ordinaries index slipped 1.7 to 1,566.7 in turnover of A$203m, down from A$224m. Woodside Petroleum gained 12 cents to A$3.50 after the company reported a large increase in interim net profit. NEW ZEALAND finished mixed, as Magnum, the brew- ing.and retail company which reported worse than expected annual results last week, fell another 12 cents to A$1.83. The NZSE-40 index put on 3.50 to 1,426.38 as turnover picked up to NZ$18m from NZ$17m. SINGAPORE was mixed in nervous trading on continued rumours that Prime Nister Goh Chok Tong might soon resign. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 1.39 to 1,426.42 as turnover declined from S$60m to S$43m. Mr Goh denied the rumours after the close. KUALA LUMPUR saw vol- ume drop from 52m to 28m shares, but the composite index, buoyed by some main component stocks on index- linked buying, firmed 1.78 to 561.83. SOUTH AFRICA GODS acelerated their gals with a 4.1 per cent rise on speculative buylag In a thin market, the Mtor indx do- tai 46 higher at 1,167. Johan- sbuars lndutriab put mo 18 to 4,123 and the all-share index endd 36 higher at 3,402."

   "text_content" : "T HE SEASON for report- ing Dutch companies' hal-a results began with a bang four weeks ago, but has since faded away with a whimper, leaving share prices in Amsterdam little changed overall and lacking in direction. Philips, the electronics group, kicked off the season with better than expected results on August 1. This has helped the company's stock climb to several 12-month highs in August and Septem- ber, marking the first sus- tained rise in its share price since the group plunged into losses in mid-1990. In retrospect that first day of the reporting season was also the highlight With just a few more leading companies, such as Heineken, Internationale Nederlanden and Amev, sched- uled to release their results in the next few days, the stream of earnings figures has not lifted the bourse out of the dol- drums. \"Company results have been slghtly diosapon g overal says Mr Er*nHu an :;aalt atmPterson, Hedrn& Pierson. \"There have been quite a few declines in results, some of them steep.\" *However, most declines did not differ dramatically from analysts' forecasts. On aver- age, per-share profit figures were 2 to 3 per cent below expectations, says Mr Huljboom. Accordingly, down- ward adjustments of full profits have also been modest. price rise by 11.8 per cent since announcing its results, closing at F136.90 ($1860) yesterday; the market has slipped 1.5 per cent over the same period. Apart from Philips, however, there has been only a handful of compa- nies with figures that were whole-heartedly welcomed by the market. Wolters Kluwer, the pub- lisher, has been rewarded for its 30 per cent increase in net profits by a 5.2 per cent rise in its share price since its figures were announced on August 27. ABN Amro, the biggest Dutch bank, surprised the market with a 20 per cent rise in gross profits, while KLM, arguing that its cost-cutting measures were beginning to pay off, reported a trebling in first- quarter results. Both compa- nies' shares have held on to the gains prompted by their results. These results enjoyed a rather different reception to that given to the half-year fig- ures of companies such as KBB, the retail group, Bfihr- mann-Tetterode, the paper and packaging company, and Hoo- govens, the steel concern. In these cases, lower or dis- appointing earnings, coupled with gloomy forecasts, led to a drop in the companies' share prices. KBB shares were the worst affected, falling 9.3 per cent to stand at Fl 73 yesterday since the release of the com- pany's figures on August 29. Notwithstanding the individ- ual rises and falls, the market Share price & Index rebased 118 110 90 Jul26 Aug Sep sO neMUOasum f991 as a whole was essentially flat in August, and early this month. The CBS tendency index, which stood at 93.2 on July 31, has hovered around the 91.5 mark in the first trad- ing days of September, closing yesterday at 91.8, up 0.3. Analysts, however, say the market could well break out of this narrow trading range in late 1991, if the expected recovery materialises in Anglo-Saxon economies. \"The US and the UK are of major importance to a whole range of Dutch listed companies,\" notes Mr Heinie Hakker of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam. Potential beneficiaries include Ahold, the food retailer, Aegon, the insurer, and Wessanen, the foodstuffs group. For DAS, the truck- maker, a recovery in the UK truck market would help stem mounting losses. Because of its traditional sensitivity to the dollar, the bourse's direction is also dependent on the trend of the US currency. It was the dollar's steady rise in the first quarter of this year that helped Amsterdam outperform most other European stock markets. Significantly, during the recent reporting season, the dollar was generally unchanged against the guilder except for a brief rise on Red Monday, the day of the Soviet coup, adding to the Amsterdam bourse's listlessness."

Hachette, the media group, fell FFr10.40 or 5.2 per cent to FFr190.60 on reports that it could shoulder about 50 per cent of any losses at La Cinq, the television channel in which it holds 25 per cent.

The Hex index shed 15.9 to 949.6. FRANKFURT fell back again in thin volume, the DAX index closing 7.73 lower at 1,647.91 after a fall of 5.38 to 681.92 in the FAZ at midsession. Ger- man stock market turnover fell from DMSbn to DM2.7bn. Dealers said that a DM12 fall to DM2,042 in Allianz, after an intraday low of DM2,030, brought the rest of the market down with it. Insurance shares have been depressed in recent weeks because of a series of new share issues, including the public flotations of Volksfir- sorge and Aachener und Min- chener Lebensversicherung. Carmakers and retailers were generally weak. There were short-term profits to be taken, in Volkswagen and Asko, but Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dilsseldorf said that the profit-taking argument was limited. VW, down DM3.40 at DM385.30, was DM640 a year ago, he noted; and Daimler, which fell DM6 to DM752, was close to the DM1,000 level some 18 months ago. Meanwhile, an old specula- tive favourite continued its revival, as Continental, the tyremaker, put on another DM3.20 to DM223.20 on a com- bination of fundamental argu- ments - the prospect of recov- ery on higher tyre prices - and speculation on the poten- tial co-operation deal with Pirelli Spa of Italy. MILAN digested the August mutual funds data, which con- tinued this year's trend with good news for the industry - a net inflow of L613bn - and bad news for equity funds, which saw another net out- flow, this time of L112bn. Sanpaulo Bank in London said that the first seven months of this year had pro- duced a net inflow of L3,796bn for the industry, but that the mutual funds' net investment in the equity market had fallen by L1,850bn over the same period. Italian shares, said San- paulo, accounted for only 19 per cent of the funds' assets by the end of July, compared with 30 per cent in 1989. Yesterday reflected this trend. Turnover was estimated at only L50bn, as the Comit index rose 1.33 to 556.81. How- ever, the telecommunications sector outpaced the rest with a 1 per cent gain, Sirti rising L315 to L11,480 while Stet put on another L24 to L1,982. MAD[RID received mild encouragement from the inter- est rate cut in the UK, which . raised hopes of a similar move in Spain. The general index ended 0.07 up at 274.62, recoup- ing a small early loss, in quiet trading worth about Pta9bn after Tuesday's Pta8bn. Uralita, the construction group which announced a sharp fall in pre-tax profits, dropped Pta55 to Ptal,585, while Zardoya Otis, which reported a gain in pre-tax earn- ings, rose Ptal80 to Ptal2,770. AMSTERDAM's half-year reporting season continued, with HBG, the builder, losing Fl 1.50 to Fl 223.50 after announcing a 10 per cent rise in net profits. Gist Brocades recouped part of Tuesday's loss, rising 60 cents to F135.90. VIENNA moved higher in increased turnover. The ATX index added 8.92 to 1,125.91. Trading in Zentralsparkasse and Laenderbank, Austria's third and fourth largest banks, was suspended before they announced that their merger had been finalised.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Bylaid, UK Stock Market Editor THE TIMING of the latest half- point reductions in domestic base rates was the only surprise for the UK stock market, and share prices soon gave back the scattering of gains which had greeted the announcements from the high street banks yesterday morning. Immediately after the news that base rates had been trimmed to 10% per cent, the market moved up by nearly 11 points on the FT-SE scale. But the gain melted away later and, with Wall Street sluggish in early trading, the London market closed down 4.4 at FT-SE 2,664.6. The base rate cuts, soon fol- lowed by reductions in mort- gage rates by the Halifax and Abbey National, two of Britain's largest home loan Aug2 Sept2 Sepl1 Aug2 Sep12 Sepo Aug Sep013 Sep 27 LAuM STr ssp o p Oct 7 institutions, appeared to lncrease slightly the chances Of a UK general election in November. Market strategists now predict a further half- point fall in base rates soon, probably in October, but areed that the final outcome of yesterday's interest rate development had been disap- pointing. At Nomura Research Insti- atute Europe, Mr Nick Knight snificantly reduced forecasts for the Footsle, both for this Sand next, just before the rate new, which he said merely reinforced his views; the rate cuts \"increase the risk of trouble for sterling\", he counumted. Nomura sees the Footsie at only 2,400 at the end of this year compared with its earlier prediction of 2,600; for next year, tfirm sees the index at 2,700, Aignilcantly lower than its oarlier target of 300. Mr Knight believes that share prices could run into trouble as the recession in the UK economy moves into recovery, and good news proves to have been only too well discounted. Mr Bill Smith at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said the opportuni- ties for further good news on Interest rates was now much reduced. However, bae rate trends.-appear to be on target for his expectation that they will be at 10 per cent by the fourth quarter of the year. At County NatWest, Mr Bob OSmple warned that there has not yet been much evidence of a recovery in the UK economy, and that the stock market could face further rights issues. Building and construction shares, which have suffered most from the prolonged pres- sure of hish interest rates in the UK, sesd to make ground. But by the end of the session, gaPis In such prominent names as Tarmac and RMC were of only a few pence. Retail issues, which would benefit from any upturn in consumer spending on the back of yesterday's base rate reductions, also responded somewhat unthusiastia ly. Bid ho; or reslts hld some street names, but such ing stocks as Marks: and Spencer and GUS closed easier. A steady eorfmance from sterling had little effect on the blue chip internationals, which were unsettled by Wall Street's fall overnight. Over the full range of the market, genuine investment business remained relatively light. Traders ascribed the increase in Seaq business to 507.7m shares yesterday from 482.8m on Monday to intra- market activity. Stock Exchange statistics show that retail, or customer, interest in equities in the London mar- ket has fallen back over the past week.",

   "text_content" : "HILLSDOWN put in the best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday, reflecting relief in the market that the food manufacturing company had announced interim results in line with most analysts' forecasts. The shares advanced 10 to 249p on heavy turnover of 5.9m. The Â£77.6m profits were slightly below last year's fig- ures. Since the beginning of the year the shares have been hit first by a bear raid and then by the downturn in the economy, and the flat results were greeted with relief by ner- vous institutional investors. The rise in the dividend by 0.2p to 2.2p was also welcome news. However, a note of caution crept into the market as ana- lysts lowered full-year esti- mates slightly to Â£195m to Â£198m from Â£200m to Â£205m after the company warned of weakness in poultry profits and foresaw no strong recovery in its non-food division. Sun Alliance nerves , The insurance sector of the market braced itself for bad news from composite insurer San Alliance, which reports interim figures this morning. Specialists are looking for Sun Alliance to reveal heavy losses from its mortgage indemnity business. Big losses from this area were reported two weeks ago by- Eagle Star, the BAT Indus- tries subsidiary, and analysts moved quickly to adjust their expectations for Sun Alliance, along with Legal & General and Royal Insurance, the big- gest players in the mortage indemnity area. The market range of expecta- tions for Sun Alliance's losses during the first half extends from around Â£35m to more than Â£100m, with the general consensus put around Â£75m. A dividend increase of up to 10 per cent to 5.5p is commonly expected, although many ana- lysts think a 6 to 7 per cent rise would be acceptable. Sun Alliance shares held at 376p. Heavy Asda trade Asda, the food retailing group, was actively traded on speculation late in the day that it may soon announce senior boardroom appointments to improve its standing with investors. The shares gained 2 to 96p on turnover of 9.8m. One of the main suggestions was that Sir John Harvey- Jones, former chairman of ICI, may be asked to become chair- man. Talk also resurfaced that Mr Archie Norman, finance director at Kingfisher, could become the chief executive. Water shares were among the market's best performers as the institutions took the view that the latest moves by Mr Ian Byatt, the water indus- try regulator, had been over- played and that the sector would benefit strongly if the governing Conservative party were to win the next general election. The latest cut in domestic interest rates was viewed by dealers as another positive development for the Tory party, which has, according to the most recent opinion polls, overtaken the Labour party opposition Dealers said there had been evidence that institutions had again been switching out of the smaller water issues and into the Footsie stocks, a trend ini- tiated some months ago. Heavy turnover in the big water stocks in recent sessions con- firmed this view, it was said. Severn Trent was the most active stock in the sector with 7.4m shares traded as the price advanced 9 to 359p. Anglian, on 5.8m, added 6 at 391p. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Charterhouse Tilney said the market had overestimated reg- ulatory and political worries. Kleinwort Benson was the driving force behind some strong gains in the regional electricity stocks (recs). Simon Williams, at Kleinwort, said that once the market had dis- counted earnings recovery, in the event of an end to the recession in the UK, \"there will be a strong refocusing on earn- ings and dividend certainty, of which the recs are a logical beneficiary\". The merchant bank high- lighted the attractions of the Electricity Package, which rose 50 to Â£2135. Second-quarter results from BAT Industries were very much in line with observers' forecasts as they had already been signalled by the poor results from BAT's subsidiary Eagle Star. The shares closed 2 off at 696p. Reckitt &Colman was firm ahead of interim figures due today, rising 11 to 726p. Hoare Govett is anticipating profits of Â£123m, up from Â£113m at the same time last year, and argues that the shares are undervalued. Revived speculation that Kingfisher may bid for Ratners caused some excitement in the stores sector. But stores spe- cialists believed the interest in Ratners was more likely to come from suggestions that Ratners may announce a pen- sion holiday with its interim results in a fortnight's time. Kingfisher eased 5 to 567p and Ratners added 5 at 134p. Storehouse improved 5 to 116p as Morgan Stanley made positive noises about BhS's autumn range. Morgan Stanley was also behind a rise of 5 to 266p in Dixons, where it was confident about current trad- ing.

Talk that Blue Cir- cle (BCI) will launch a Â£400m- plus rights issue with its interim today was not entirely convincing, with at least two of the big broking houses arguing that the chances of a cash call were only one-in-three. BCI held at 268p. Amec raced up 15 to 218p after interim profits of Â£21.9m, at the top end of estimates, and a dividend increase described as \"a pleasant surprise\" by sec- tor specialists. Wimpey's main- tinred dividend; the absence of a rights issue and the fact that it managed to achieve a profit for the period promoted sup- port for the shares, which ended 7 better at 178p. BZW pencilled in a full-year forecast of Â£58m for Wimpey, with Â£62m expected the following year. A presentation by Williams Holdings to around 150 institu- tions and analysts yesterday morning prompted a strong showing in the shares. The company provided an in-depth view of the performance of Yale & Valor since its acquisi- tion by the group in March. Mr David Ireland of securities house Hoare Govett said Wil- liams gave \"a polished perfor- mance with a lot of detail\". The shares rose 11 before eas- ing in the afternoon to close 6 up at 352p on turnover of 2.7m. Waste management group Attwoods, on unusually heavy turnover of 2.4m, climbed 9 to 220p. The bulk of the turnover was accounted for by an agency cross of 750,000 shares, which would be double counted on the Seaq ticker. The bounce appeared to herald the disappearance of a large seller. One observer said a big fund manager had been reduc- ing its stake from 8 per cent to 5 per cent recently. T&N gained 5 to 178p on turnover of 2.4m on recovery prespects in a number of its markets, after reporting a steep fall in interim profits from 46.1m to Â£20.3m in line with market forecasts. Mr John Goldschmidt at Charterhouse Tilney said the results provided \"some encour- agement for the next year\", but he maintained his full-year profits forecast of Â£55m. Mr Sandy Morris at County NatWest said: \"There is enor- mous recovery potential in T&N, but it needs to be fast and strong if it is to justify the current rating.\" He cut this year's estimate by Â£13m to E45m and 1992's by Â£6m to E80m. Croda International dropped 19 to 160p as the company announced results worse than feared and cut its dividend. Lehman Brothers, broker to the company, reduced its full- year forecast by Â£4m to Â£21m. Mr Martin Glen of Lehman said the yield was still above the market average but the dividend cut could prompt sell- ing by income funds, which hold much of the stock.

   "text_content" : "THE September FT-SE's futures premium to the spot index narrowed significantly yesterday as derivatives trad- ers digested the implications of the latest cut in UK interest rates, writes Jim McCallum. Initially, FT-SE futures moved higher after the govern- ment surprised the markets with the reduction in rates. But the gains were quickly given up, particularly in the futures market, where the belief grew that a general elec- tion is now more likely to be held this year. The possibility that political factors may begin to play a greater role in the market was the main reason behind the September FT-SE contract shedding some of its lead over the cash market. By the close, the premium was standing at 15 points, against 20-25 earlier in the week. The narrowing in the premium was also the opportu- nity for arbitrageurs to begin to unwind positions. Septem- ber closed 10 lower at 2,679. Increased turnover in the stock market spilled over into traded options. Sears was again a busy market as one investor bought 1,000 apiece of December 70 and 90 calls and sold 2,000 December 80 calls. Dealers believed this reversed a transaction executed in the previous session."
