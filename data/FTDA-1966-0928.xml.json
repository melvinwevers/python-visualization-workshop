   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Correspondent The Government intends to maintain restraint on family spending, and to delay expansion of the social services, beyond the current period of economic crisis. Instead of allowing the nation to embark on \"a feverish consumer boom.\" it will give top priority to greater investment-a possib lity not ruled out \" even during the period of disinflation.\" This was made clear in London yesterday by Mr Harold Wilson, in a speech to over 70 of Britain's most influential businessmen, industrialists, and union leaders. Opening his National Produc- tivity Conference in Lancaster House, the Prime Minister gave a broad hint that hire-purchase restrictions will be maintained for some time to come. And he declared: \"We do not see any solution to the problem of under-capacity working by simply signing bigger cheques in the short run for our social programmes.\" Hint of Action to Help Business? The closest Mr. Wilson came to a firm commitment was his com- nient that more could be spent during the period of disinflation, provided the money went on indus- trial investment. Some of his listeners saw in this a hint that positive Government action to lpbusinessmen in this respect might be in the offing. At a Press conference last night, the Prime Minister did not elaborate on his speech. But he claimed that many delegates had told him that the conference had \" transcended most people's hopes.\" and he himself thought it might eventually develop into \"a Parliament of industry.\" Mr. Michael Stqwart. Minister tfor Ecornomic Afairs. outlined the Inoal lines of agpement that had eon drawn up. It was noticeable, however, that some of the main suggestions put forward by the Na0tonal Economic Development Office for considera tion were not accepted. A oroposal that a full-scale cam paign be launched to persuade companies to seek a 10 per cent rise in productivity over the next year is not going ahead, although there appears to have been general agreement on the need for indi- vidual companies to adopt appro- priate targets. Pilot Schemes Shelved Another idea, for the introduc tion of pilot schemes aimed at discovering whether more meaning- ful bargaining can be achieved at plant level, also appears to have been shelved. Mr. Stewart said last night that a final decision on this would not be taken until closer study had been made of existing plant bargaining schemes. It is understood that union leaders at the conference supported the pilot scheme proposal, but that It met with strong opposition from the employcrs and was also criticised b Mr. Aubrey Jones chairman of the National Board for Prices and Incomes. Mr. Jones' view appears to have been that discussion between management and men at plant level might well concern itself with increasing pay, rather than with raising output per man. He also felt that the selection of plants tbat were representative of industry would be extremely difficult. Among the employers, there seems to have been a general fear that plant negotiations might degenerate into a series of pro- posals for \" buying out\" restrictive practices. The bluntness of Mr. Wilson's opening speech was taken by some to be an indication that he will be in no mood to compromise with critics at next week's Labour Party conference. Obviously, Mr. Wilson will do his utmost to win maximum support for the Government's economic measures from delegates attending the Brighton talks. But if the Left Wing, of the party mounts a full-scale attack. it can expect few concessions. Releasing Labour \"Essential\" Mr. Wilson' acknowledged, for exampleahat the policy of. seeking the release of labour, rather than the spreading of work, was a harsh, and painful one. It was neverthe less essential Having released resources and made more industrial capacity available through redeployment, it was the Government's intention to use that capacity for the purpose of strengthening the economy. This had not been done in the past, and consequently periods of rapid expansion had. within months, inevitably led to balance of payments crises. Mr. Wilson said he could not forecast when the disinflationary process would have worked itself out to the extent necessary to per- mit any general reflation. \" I repeat, there can be no general easing up until we are pay- ing our way and seen to be paying our way.\" he added. \" What I do say is that even during the period of disinflation we shall be able to spend more-not on consumption or social expenditure, but on invesi- ment.\" Methods of boosting investment were one of the three main topics discussed by the conference during its day-long talks. Mr. Wilson promised delegates that the Ideas that many of them had been working on for \" directed help to investment\" would b:e listened to with interest. All the suggestions made would he given Contlnued on Page 6 Conference report Page 6; Editorial comment Page 12 LÂ« Continued from Page 1 SPENDING CURBS WILL STAY the fullest consideration. \"to the extent that this ls possible In as are very olose to fiscal poloy,\" In a prepared paper on invest ment.

   "text_content" : "From Our Midlands Correspondent Mr. Michael Stewart, Minister for Economic Affairs, with Mr. Harold Wilson dur- ing the opening session of the National Productivity Conference at Lancaster House in London yesterday. M BIRMINGHAM, Sept. 27. Assembly of all British Motor Corporation models made at the Austin plant at Long* bridge, Birmingham, which employs 25,000, will be halted from to-morrow until further I notice by the official strike of 650 delivery drivers. The corporation was able to stave oil the full impact of the strike to-day by finding a little extra parking space. This enabled restricted production of many cars to be continued by the night shift. About 7,500 BMC workers have been laid off. The strike of delivery drivers employed by the Longbridge Group of Delivery Agents will continue \"until there is a complete with- drawal of all 'notices of redun- dancy.\" This was stated' to-night by Mr. Alan Law. regional comn- eWoulat'-vehbcle secretary of- the Transpdrt and General Workers' Union - However. Mr. Law indicated that he was willing to make himself available for talks. The Longbridge Group of Delivery Agents, in a statement after its meeting to-day, accused the union of calling a strike while negotiations about redundancy were still going on. The group said the \" misleading comments\" of senior trade union officials were \" unwarranted, unlust and untruthful.\" Company Statement Detailing the steps leading up to the strike. the group said it wrote to Mr. Law informing him of the critical situation in certain member companies and of their intention to send out redundancy notices. The LGDA statement added: \"At no time during our negotir. tions, either at depot level or at the Joint Negotiating Council; was a dispute declared. It is to the union's discredit that they have seen fit to ignore the disputes procedure of our agreement, which clearly lays down that there shall be no strike or lock-out before the procedure is exhausted.\" In reply. Mr. Law claimed that the LGDA was itself in betacb of agreement. ;because i. d announced. the lay-offs wkibt. going' throtiaill. stiages of negotaigprodure. Mr. Law added that the TGWU had. returned all the individual redundancy notices to' the employers Talks With Gunter The way the car industry is facing up to the problems of short- time working and redundancy is to be the subject of talks at national level to-morrow. Mr. Ray Gunter. Minister of Labour. is to discuss the effects of the squeeze on car workers at three separate meetings. The unions have so far not drawn up any common policy at national level towards the current recession in the car industry. The result is that Instead of a joint meeting with Mr. Gunter the National Union of Vehicle Builders is to see the Minister alone. When the NUVB leave they will be followed by the Amalgamated Engineering Union and representatives of the Con- federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. Then Mr. Gunter will have to go through the same procedure with the TOWU. Continued on Pane 13 Continijed on Pane 13 See Men and Matters Page 12 Continued from Page 1 Drivers' strike Reperoussions of the LODA strike qauickly began to hit sub. sidiary tactoriem, and as the day wore on the numbers involved were revised upwards. Some 600 are affected at Pressed Steel-FiPsher Washwood Heath (Birmilgham), where 3.300 are employed on making bodies and naother 530 of 3,600 at Morris Commercial Cars, which makes light vans. While the engineering depart* ments at Austin making engines and other components-some for export-are as yet unaffected, a BMC spokesman said It could be only a matter of a day or two before they and other (actories lupplying Austin felt the reper. cussions. On the other hand, the Morris Motorp' plant at Oxford making about half BMC's car output, is continuing to operate on a reduced programme brought n last week when the massive iort-time work.

   "text_content" : "By LEX Gilt-edged were the firmest section of a very quiet Stock Exchange yesterday, with the longer end coming into favour and showing gains up to *. There was again little change in the level of equities-the share index was 0.1 down at 306.0. John Laing If anyone still nurtured any doubts about the health of the building industry after Bryant Holdings' results and forecast, then John Laing's half year figures will dispel them. Profits before tax have slumped from Â£874.000 to Â£512.000 and they are going to be lower in the second half. This indicates a pre-tax total for the year of Â£950,000 or so against Â£2.527m. and Â£3.1m. in 1964, the contractor's annus mirabilis. These are easily Laing's worst results for 10 years despite Â£425,000 or so of rental income. The story behind this decline is in part the familiar one of sharply rising labour costs and the effects of the downturn in sales of private houses. But Laing has also been caught on the hop, gearing itself up both as a user of industrialised building techniques and a manu- facturer of building materials to the Great National Plan targets. This has produced some splendid growth in the depreciation charge (up from Â£425.000 to Â£633,000) and a certain amount of unused capacity. Thus profits are going to drop sharply despite the prospect that there will be little change in output this year. Where does this leave the share price ? At 16s 6d, down Is 6d to a new 1966 \" low,\" the \" A \" are selling at 30.6 times prospective earnings on a full tax charge. though Laing's actual rate will be very subnormal. Hiving off the property side which always used to make the contractini side look cheap, still does something to prop up the share price but not enough. Extracting the investment proper- ties at their market . value of Â£12.475m. and other investments In the balance sheet at Â£2.056m. leaves the trading side selling at a reason- able 8.2 times prospective earnings. On the other hand applying the current 25 per cent. discount to property asset values pushes up the PIE ratio to 18.2 times. Thus a lot will depend on how soon and how far Laing's profits can recover. There seems little doubt that 1967 is going to be another hard year unless the Government reflates quickly. Even then only the building materials side, which felt the pinch in sum. mer 1965. is in a position to benefit in 1967 and SET will add an un. recoverable Â£500.000 over the next 18 months.

In the event there is nothing wrong with profits in the first half -they have risen 14.3 per cent. to Â£2.15m. The trouble, when it comes, will be in the current six months with the traditional end of the business, especially weaving, finding the going hard. The up- shot is that profits for the year may run out at say Â£5.4m. before tax, at best, cum the Gaunson and Hadfield acquisitions, against Â£5.2m. ex these two a year earlier. Taking a 35 per cent. tax rate this would leave earnings of 20 per cent, to cover the 15 per cent. dividend. The share price has kept well in step with events, dropping from the high of 16s 03%d to the current 12s. where yield is 6% per cent and the prospective p/e 12 times. The crucial question is whether the share price has gone far enough in recognising the gradual slow down in Viyella's growth over the last couple of years. It is not as though Viyella has any other edge on its competitors once profits stop rising; Carring- tons, Courtaulds, and Coats all offer substantially better returns and are in the same ex-growth boat. See also Page 14 Brown Bayley Brown Bayley's profits for the first six months, which still do not consolidate the results of the two main subsidiaries, are even more irrelevant than usual. Thus though the dividends it has received from the two have dropped only slightly from Â£131.000 to Â£120,000. the underlying profits have really been hit on the head. Brown Bayley Steels' profit has dropped from Â£348.000 to Â£92,500 and the fore- cast is the second half will be worse. In contrast the second sub- sidiary, Hoffman Manufatring,, has managed to hold on to the bulk of its profits. Before tax they have slipped only Â£13,000 to Â£420.000 and the interim dividend is un- changed at 7Y per cent. In the light of its profits it is hardly sur- prising that Brown Bayley Steels has chopped its interim 2 points to 5 per cent. Naturally the BBS price has taken this sequence of events to heart and dropped 2s 3d to 17s yesterday. After all even a 17 per cent. dividend (against 19 per cent.) would require earnings of Â£204.000 whereas the first half produced only Â£70.000 and the second half will show even less. This leaves Hoffman Manufacturing. At 14s 6d Hoffman yields 8.8 per cent. and is selling at II Vl times earnings; neither is obviously a magnet but both have a great deal to recom- mpnd them compared with the other two of the trio since the cut in the BBS dividend Is bound to mean one for Brown Baylev as well.

   "text_content" : ".. y Owr CmmMiMWp u Stet THE BRITISH farmer's Indepen- dent character and his lack of business experience are the chief stumbling blocks in forming agri- cultural co-operative and group marketing schemes. In short, the major obstacles to the efficient operation of such schemes are to be found \"within the farmer him- self.\" These views are contained in a report released yesterday by the Agricultural Market Development Executive Committee. The' report is the result of a 12-month investigation, costing Â£5.000, sponsored by the National Farmers' Unions of England and Wales. Scotland and Ulster. with the aid of a 90 per cent. grant recommended by the Agricultural Market Development Executive Committee. Ideological Split The farmers' resistance to- such schdmes \"derives as much from anxiety about change as it does from his much-quoted independence of character.\" the report says. \" He is accustomed to person-to-person relationships and is inexperienced in the very different context of a group.\" There was no taieus between the two aspects of group activiy amona farmera-co-operatives and marketing groups. \"The function ar comple- mentary. They would do busneas with each other because it was commerci- ally worthwhile to do so.\" The true division was between people who thought it necessary to protect farmers' interests by setting up large commercial organisations able to compete with the industrial giants. and those who .concentrated on devlping. efficet small units to meet theeed* of farmers in a par- ticular locality. \"We believe that both types of organisation are required.\" the report says. A actor' t0t hampered the co- operative type of organisation was its ideological background. \"The concept of the organisation which is there to serve its members, faithfully carrying out their wishes. is incom- patible with that of. a thrustful and successful farmer-owned commercial organisation competing successfully with industrial giants. \" If co-operatives are to succeed in becoming large, efficient commercial units, the proper relationship of the farmer to them is that of a share- holder, not of a member with all that the word implies for a special rela- tionship.\" For the group. the report foresees a future of rapid change-\" a period of painful adaptation for the farmer.

FOLLOWING a review of the general cotton situation, the Sudanese Minister of Finance and Economics has decided to scrap the system of \"combination or compensation \" deals. Trade agree- ments with socialist countries are to be maintained in a form which will \" further develop the cotton trade with them without in any way interfering with our open and competitive selling.\" The Sudan Gezira Board has re- viewed its prices and adjusted them in the light of world cotton market conditions: henceforth the Govern- ment will re-imburse 50 Sudanese piastres per 100 lbs of cotton shipped before January 1, next. The facility will not apply, however, to cotton still to be shipped under combination deals or covered by contracts already concluded. The Minister has also retained discretionary powers to extend the new arrangements to cotton shipped in January and February which has been contracted for sale during the remainder of this year. The measures are designed to further the Sudanese policy of open competitive trading in cotton, and take account of the state of the cotton textile industry, the level of stocks and the growing competition from man-made fibres. The Minister's statement points out that the Sudan's cotton trading policy has always been to en- courage the consumption of extra lon! and long staple cottons gener- ally, and to dispose of the nation's crop at the most remunerative rates.",

An answer from Washing- ton is expected shortly. The spokesman said the Indian Government had asked for 2m. tons to be shipped between October and December and the rest in the first three months of 1967. India's full needs for next year would not be known until after the harvesting of the summer crops in November. when some forecast of the winter crop could be made. Observers believe India will need to import Sm. tons to build up buffer stocks. even if a good crop is forthcoming this year. Dwindling Reserves Our Commodities Staff writes: It is by no means certain that India's request will be met. The U.S. Administration has indicated that it may not be in a position to supply more than I.2m. tons of wheat next year. because of dwindling reserves. Allowed to run down at their present rate U.S. wheat stocks could fall well below Im. tons by the middle of next year; in other words. below the recommended strategic reserve of 400m. bushels. or l.lm. tons. The U.S. is willing to offer milo as a sub- stitute. but this is not eaten by many Indians. At the same time the U.S. Govern. ment is understood to have asked India to mobilise its own surplus food stocks. using its authority to procure available supplies of rice and other food grains in those States which have a grain surplus. It is being suggested that the Reserve Bank of India's lending powers should be used as a lever-most of the surplus States run perpetual overdrafts with the bank. ."

I _ THE BEST HARVEST since 1959 has been forecast by the Republic of Ireland Department of Agricul- ture. While the acreage under cereals is sharply down on last year, principally because of a 30 per cent. reduction in wheat acre- age to 128,000 acres, yields are re- ported to be high. Thus the wheat yield is estimated at 28 cwts an acre, against 25.2 cwts an acre last year, and although this only partly compensates for the much lower acreage, the high degree of mill- ability this year is expected to give a bigger financial return to farmers -Â£6m. for 180,000 tons, against Â£5.3m. for 229,000 tons last year. The acreage under feeding barley is only slightly lower than last year -324.000 acres against 328.000 acres-and yields are estimated to be 13 per cent. higher at 30 cwts an acre. The crop (486.000 tons) is valued at Â£10.9m.. against Â£9.6m. last year. For malting barley with a frac- tionally larger acreage and a 7% per cent. higher yield (28.0 cwts an acre against 26.1 cwts an acre last year), the value of the crop (190.000 tons) is estimated at Â£5.25m.. against Â£4.65m. last year. The National Farmers' Association has criticised the Department's fore- cast as \"misleading\" and \"over- optimistic.\" It states that com- parisons with last year are misleading as it was one of the worst years for tillage on record. It also claims that barley yields in a number of counties are down on last year. and emphasises that any im- provement in the financial return on tillage will be more than offset by heavy losses on the sale of livestock at current depressed prices. JOINT TALKS ON IRISH CATTLE Members of the National Farmers' Association of Eire have been invited by the National Farmers' Union to meet at a working luncheon in London on Monday next to disouss the phasing of the imports of Irish cattle which have built up in Ireland. rmmlrrr rram +ha smbate et dcha it;\" F- #64u. l~i mllÂ· 11 ~11~"

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Editor A CLOSE EXAMINATION ot existing policies and arrangements for Australian apple and pear exports is to be undertaken by the Australian Apple and Pear Board, following adverse market results in the U.K. and Europe in the recent season. It has been decided at a special meeting of the Board in Melbourne to send a delegation to Europe for urgent investigations to see if marketing arrangements can be improved. Market returns in the 1966 export season were the worst for many years and serious losses have been suffered by importers who purchased fruit forward and by exporters who shipped on con- signment. It was emphasised at the recent special meeting. however. that heavy .lose. had also been ex- perienced on fruit from other supplying countries, such as New Zealand. which use different marketing methods. and that the slump could be traced to more fundamental factors such as over- supply during the Southern Hemi- sphere season. As a start, the Board is to introduce a further restriction on unwanted sizes and varieties in the 1967 season. The Australian fruit industry is also worried about the effeots of increas- ing freight rates which could rise by up to Is a bushel in 1967. The exist- ing rate oft freight at 15s Sd a carton already represents something close to 70 per cent, of the c.i.f. value of the product and as such is the largest single cost factor. In addition, the industry faces a 10 per cent..increase in the Formula Rate of freight under the Australian Overseas Transport Assoolation-arrangemsents - - - -"

   "text_content" : "Qir C~mi~A~td Â· BRUCELLOSIS, the disease which I has for- olea been one of the I scourges of the dairy cattle world. I was the main theme of the Min- I ister of Agriculture's speech at Brighton last night, when he ' addressed the eaau banquet of the British Veteridary AqCi tion.. Reftrring to the prposa's an nounced in July for the eradica- ion of the disease, Mr. Peart said that there had never been any dobt in his. mipd that, although brcellos 4isa iuch smaller prob lent finanialgy for the farmer, and for public health, than bovine tuberculosis, \"eradication is the right policy.\" NJevertheless, be added.. \" we have to face up to the complica- tions arising from the wide use of S.19 vaccine; particularly in adult cattle. We just could not seriously ontemplato the slaughter of something like 14 *er cent. of our female cattle of 20 months and over. This is our breeding stock on which we depehd for. the future. So we had to work out a more gradual approach. \" A lot remains to be settled, but I am looking forward to the establishment of a voluntary register of brucella-free herds in the near future. Buit we must recognise that it will be quite a while before we are able to move on to compulsory eradication by slaughter and put paid to this disease once and for all. In this big, long-term task I look forward with confidence to the full co- operation of all practising veterin ary surgeons.\" Foot and Mouth Turning to the recent serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Northumberland, Mr. Peart said that it was with pro found relief that the Ministry was able to lift the restrictions over the area on Monday. \" The past weeks have been a time of hard- ship and trial not only for those whose animals bave had to be slaughtered, but also for those who have endured the frustrating and damaging experience of not being-able to market animals at the peak of conditio and ready for sale.\" Earlier io the day, at the con- re of the association Professor 5 0 A. Betts of the Royal Veterinary Colege. London Uni- versity, told delegates that the \"brain draiin of veterinary scientists to America was caused more by frustration and in- adequate or obsolete -research facilities than by the difference in salaries. He went on to say that conver- sations he had had with several senior British veterinary sciontitsts who have emigrated to the States supported this view. Professor Betts said that this did not mean that adequate financial rewards were not necessary for re- search workers and those training I post-graduate students. \"However much satisfaction a research worker may obtain from his re- search, he normally has family commitments and perhaps pres- sures.\" The professor pointed out that the numbers of veterinary graduates undertaking post-gradu- ate training were insufficient to meet present or future needs. Research Facilities \"There has been as increase. particularly during the past three years. in the numbers of British veterinary ,graduates studying for higher degrees in the American schools. It is highly desltrable that this should occur.\" Professor Betts said. \" Nevertheless. while the wide discrepancy exists in facilities for research and monetary rewards between Britain and the U.S.. there is a risk that a relatively high , proportion of these post-graduate students may remain there or go back later.\" To make the British schools comparable with the best European schools or the average American school, some millions of pounds would have to be invested on buildings and equipment"

   "text_content" : "By Our Commodities Staff PROGRESS in the campaign against New Zealand's restrictions on wool textile imports was re- ported by officials of Britain's wool textile industry yesterday. This followed the publishing of the findings of a New Zealand Tariff Board inquiry on the import of wool textiles. Its recommendations, to be adopted by the New Zealand Government, are for the freeing from licensing restrictions and duty on woven wool cloths weigh. ing 5% oz per square yard atd less, and that the current quota for fabrics over 5% oz should be in- creased from 66% per cent. on im- ports in 1965-66 to 90 per cent. There is to be a 2% per cent. increase in duty on heavier cloths, but this is considered to be mar- ginal and compares with the domes- tic industry's request for a 10 per cent. increase. Officials of the National Wool Textile Export Corporation at Bradford yesterday described the Board's findings as \" not unfavour- able\" and said progress had been made in its 10-year struggle against New Zealand's restrictions. It had made .representations at.the inquiry in March. 1964.",

   "text_content" : "Fromn Our Wal Stret Correpoadat - NEW YORK, Sept. 27. MOSTLY SMALL GAINS were recorded on Wall Street to-day, after buoyant conditions to Sl or Smore attracted selling of Television shares, which spread to other Ssections, -followng news that TV manufacturers had been invited to a meeting in Washington to- morrow -one quarter believed recent price increases would be dis- cussed. After testing the 800 level, with a day's high of 805.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.39 up at 794.09, against a low of 789. 53. The Railroad Index rallied 0.52 to 198.19 but the Utilities Index eased a further 0.36 to 126.21. Volume expanded 1.34m. shares ,.to 6.3qn.-the best total in a fort- night-with the help of some insti- tutional buying. The earlier rise was regarded as mainly a technical recovery as there was little, or nothing, in the news generally to stimulate de- mand. Attention was attracted by the announcement that President Johnson would meet Asian leaders at a Summit Conference in Manila next month to discuss Vietnam war problems and the outlook for peace. After rising more than $5, Motorola slumped $19Y to 5119 xd ._-it said 1966 earnings would exceed 1965 but the second half would likely be under a year ago, due, to labour and material short- ,.ages and higher costs. In other Itelevisons, joIses 01 over as developed in Admiral at $42 and Magnavox at SS1% . A number of so-called \"glamour\" shares finished lower under profit taking. Corning Glass. at 5296, converted a S6% advance to a S6- loss, while Fairchild Camera, at S142%, were down 55% after a SS rise. Polaroid dipped $2% to $142%. after a further $3% improvement on very good camera demand and no knowledge of a rumoured large secondary offering. Du Pont fell another 56% to a new 1966 closing \"low\" of 5160% -some quarters believed 1966 earnings might not reach previous estimates. General Electric recovered Sl% to 587%, although it is facing a strike threat next week. United Aircraft were up Sl% to 576% although it is making. a rights issue of S58.9m. worth of Convertible Subordinated deben- tures. Canada Irregular Canadian Stock Markets closed irregular as trading followed the course of New York. Industrials eased, after having been ahead most of the day. International Nickel rose $2 to $88, attributed to final settling of its recent labour difficulties. Trans- Canada Pipe Lines gained S1 to $29%, while Clairtone Sound and Supertest each put on nearly $1.",

This follows the trend established last year when sales of such stocks rose to nearly $500m.-the sales in both 1965 and 1966 represented mainly the reduction of holdings by the British Government, but sales were recorded by other European countries. That trend, however; was more than offset iii Jahuary-June this -year by large additions to foreign holdings of deposits in U.S. banks with maturities ,of over one year and by purchase of various types of corporate and U.S. Government Agency bonds. In contrast, Canadians have been net purchasers of U.S. equity securi ties, and in the second quarter of 1966 raised their net acquisitions by nearly S100m.",

The U.S. Department of Com- merce has reported that on the basis of estimates made in June, total capital investment by U.S.- controlled subsidiaries in Canada will rise to a record S2,260m., an increase of S354m. over last year's volume. A drop to $2,150m. next year is predicted, but officials of the Department of Commerce noted that forecasts of spending have tended to underestimate actual expenditures by anywhere from 21 to 25 per cent. While conceding that such an extreme underestimate was un- TORONTO, Sept 27. likely for 1967 because of the tightness of credit, materials, equipment and machinery, the Commerce Department still thinks capital expenditure in Canada next year by subsidiaries of American companies will be substantially higher than this year's record total. For instance, the latest estimate of S2,260m. for this year's capital expenditure with a forecast at this time last year of only S1,700m., which was revised upward to S2,040m. following a second survey early this year. The report noted that the greatest impetus in spending this year came in the manufacturing area, where the year's investment is estimated to rise from $952m. in 1965 to $1.170m. this year. The report indicated that total capital spending abroad by American-controlled companies would come to $9,160m., an increase of S1,630mn. over 1965. More than half the increase was to occur in Europe with Canada accounting for much of the balance. Because a good deal of Aimerican foreign capital investment is being financed with funds obtained abroau in line with the policy urged en busi- ness by the Johnson Administration, it is impossible to determine the exact impact of the projected overseas spending on the U.S. balance of pay. ments position. However, the report noted that the largest rise in U.S. capital flow for business last year went to Canada, the total increasing by nearly S700m."

A LEADING Canadian economist strongly called for the Canadian Government to play a leading role in promoting freer trade and strongly criticised the former Finance Minister, Mr. Walter Gordon's, arguments against American. investments in Canada. Professor Harry, G. Johnson, now Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and University of Chicago in a speech to the Canadian Club of Montreal called for the elimination of tariffs and expanded free trade with other countries. Professor Johnson said Canada must soon make the choice between two real, alternatives. \" The alterna- tives are first to demonstrate our national independence and political rturity by scrapping our obsolete natioal *ofoy in favour of oae that recognises and attempts to overcome the limitations of our relatively small national market. The other is to con. firm our political immaturity by a reactionary retreat into vainglorious and self-defeating nationalistic policies inherited from our genuinely colonial past.\" He added that Canada could play a leading role in promotiqg freer trade with the elimination of tariffs on both sides and a firm guarantee of continuing free access to foreign markets. Referring to the former Finance Minister's strong conviction that Canada is losing its indepen- dence because of American invest- ment, Professor Johnson said. \"No convincing argument has ever been offered by Mr. Gordon and his sup- porters for this assertion. On the contrary both logic and a mass of evidence point to the conclusion that wealth and independence go together and that economic arrangements that promote the one pronote'the other.\""

   "text_content" : "Fr6mo Ort-IVhtA . AS PRESIDENT JOHNSON and Dr. Erhard concluded their two days of talks here there were no indications that they had reached meaningful agreements on the many issues which confronted them. A communique issued here this evening after over six hours' delay while aides feverishly worked on the text gave some. indication of tough bargaining between' the two leaders but few hints of genuine accord. The main accomplishment of the talks-besides an agreement for a Washington-Bonn '' hot line \"-hai been to take some of the heat out of the question of support costs for U.S. troops stationed in Germany. Dr. Erhard agreed to a proposal by President Johnson that an Anglo- American-German committee re- view the strategic requirements in West Germany. This committee would have the task of estimating NATO troop requirements irrespec- tive of financial considerations. It would also define what troop levels would be desirable if they could be found. 'The communique spoke of \"a searching rbappraisal\" of the present threat to security in Western Europe and of a need for \"equitable sharing\" of the cost of maintaining a defence against that threat. There are no indications as yet on who has won the battle of wills over a re-negotiation of, the existing American-German offset arrangement. Dr. Erhard yesterday asked the President for considerable modifci* tions to its terms. He said Geafnany could not meet its obligatiQn to buy S1,350m. worth of U.S. arms by next June 30,. that it wanted to buy non- military equiiment and that in hituro years it wanted a 50 per cent. cut in its obligations. The V.S. Adpininstration has apparently been unwilling to budge. WASHINGTON, Sept 27. This question has now been banded over to the tripartite conversatiomn. Dr. Erhard promised that Germany would \"make eevry, a irt fully to meet the current offset agreement.\" But perhaps he has won a round by at least having this matter put on the agenda for the forthcoming tripartite",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent NEW YORK, Sept. 27. AMERICAN CAR manufacturers have started a potentially damag- ing escalation of their warranty offers in their rivalry to lure buyers for their 1967 models. Following decisions a few weeks ago by General Motors, Ford Motor and American Motors to grant a five-year or 50,000-mile warranty for power trains (engine and transmission), Chrysler has also disclosed that it will match recent decisions by its three competitors to grant a two-year or 24.000- mile warranty on other parts. of their cars. Previously, the com- pany had allowed only a one-year 'or 12,000-mile warranty on all parts of its cars except power trains. In the wake of Chrysler's deci- sions, meanwhile GM disclosed late to-night that it, too. would extend its five-year warranty to parts of its cars' suspension and steering systems and' with other manufac- turers now expected to follow suit the question arises whethei the gain in car sales resulting from the im- proved warranty provisions will more than offsetthe costs of pro- viding long-term guarantees. -Provision of the ,lonisterm warranty is generally regarded to have been an important factor in Chrysler's strong recovery follow- ing a sales slump beginning in the early 1960's, but much of the com- petitive edge of an alluring guaran- tee is lost once it is allowed by other manufacturers as well. Significantly, though cars im- ported from Britain, France and Germany by Ford, Chrysler and GM seem likely to benefit from their new warranty arrangements, the high cost of financing warranty agreements appears to have been the main factor so far discouraging other importers from offering similar arrangements to prospec- tive buyers. Prices Reduced In a separate development both Ford and Chrysler have now dis- closed that they will roll back part of their proposed price increases for their 1967 models to bring them more closely into line with others announced previously by GM. the largest manufacturer. Following announcements by Ford and Chrysler last week that they would raise the average price of their cars for 1967 by $107 and S92 respectively, GM issues new price 'ists indicating an average ris of ohly $56. Partly by switch.- ing to optional extras some items of equipment previously planned as standard on .1967 cars, Ford has now cut its average increase to $66 and Chrysler to S68. Reuter reports from Detroit that new car sales continued to drop in mid-September as GM, Ford, Chrysler and American Motors all posted declines in volume compared with last year. 'The four manufac. turers retailed 133,029 cars in the September 11-20 period. down 19 per cent. from the 165,1011 of a year earlier.",

The following is an extract from his circulated statement: The profit before taxation is Â£439,547, as against Â£458.611 for the previous year, a fall of about Â£19,000. Taxation was reduced from Â£248,551 to Â£179,126. However. as Income Tax retained on the payment of dividends has also decreased the actual tax saving is some Â£40,000. This saving will not be seen in future yearL The amount due to the Com- pany's Bankers has risen from Â£136.730 to Â£379,815. The pro- vision of additional permanent finance is being carefully con- sidered by your Roard. In this connection a revaluation has recently been obtained which adds substantially to the book value of the Group's freehold interest in the Olympia site. Exhibition Halls are still the largest single contributory to the Company's profit and the profit during the year from this source has been satisfactorily maintained. The demand for space from indus- try continues unabated. Results from Exhibition Con- tracting have not come up to expectation, although your interests appear to have maintained their normal share of available trade. The Industrial Catering sub- sidiary has had a continued record of advancing profits over the years. Turnover is up substantially but competition is keen and increased overheads have bad an effect on profit margins. The group is now operating over 500 establishments. The profit from Timber Import- ing and Builders Merchanting is a little below the record figure shown for 1964/65. The yield on this investment exceeds the figure forming the basis of purchase. The first twelve months profit from our Garage Proprietary interests has exceeded expectations. Your Company's interests have been further extended by purchas- ing Auto-Parks Limited, traffic consultants and managers of car parks at outdoor events. The report was adopted and a total dividend of 20% (same) approved.",

The following is an extract from his circulated statement: I am pleased to report that the profit forecast made when the shares were placed with the Public in December 1965 has been ex- ceeded by over 13%. During the year our total sales increased by nearly 12% and this additional business has enabled us to absorb considerable rises in costs of services and salaries. The increased sales were spread over the majority of our principal products and apply proportionately to the Contracting and Engineer- ing Industries and the Merchant- ing side of our business. The. Hire Department continued to develop satisfactorily and made a useful contribution to our profits. Prospects: During the first Quarter of the current year our sales volume has increased in accordance with our target. How- ever, the deflationary measures announced by the Government on the 20th July will undoubtedly afqct future trading and it remains ditffcult to forecast our prospects for the remainder of the year, Fortunately our, activities are diversified over many customers and trades, and therefore, if the unemployment figure indicated b the Government is not exceeded, there are grounds for anticipating that your Company may be more fortunate than many others. The report was adopted and the total dividend of 14% approved.

Aagocdtion The report, released yesterday, revealed that the number of visitors last year was 14 per cent. above 1964. The Association forecasts an increase to 5m. a year in the 1970's. It was only in, 1955 that Britain topped the Im. mark for the first time. Against those encouraging features of British tourism, the rer port notes that in 1965 more than Sm. U.K. residents took holidays in foreign countries and spent Â£265m. That was an increase of 77 per cent. over the past five years. In the same period British pople holidaying at home spent only 15 per cent. more in U.K. resorts. Share Falling International traffic was one of the fastest growth activities in the .world. The two main areas of ex- pansion were in Europe and be- tween Europe and North America. About 80 per cent. of international tourism was in those areas which included Britain. Despite the rapid growth in foreign visitors to Britain it was \" pure delusion to see in this an excuse for complacency. We have to face the harsh fact that Britain's share of the world tourist market is now falling,\" the report stated. Perhaps because it was necesary to cross the sea to reach Britain, visitors used to make a longer stay here than elsewhere. But travel was now becom. ing o easy and cheap that there was an increasing tendency for people to keep on the move, with the object of seeing more countries in the course of a single holiday. That Inevitably affected Britain more than the Con. tinent The report puts forward a number of reasons for the fact that foreign competitors had captured a substan- tial proportion of the British home market including the \"slow but in- exorable rise in prices for British people holidaying In Britain.\" To reverse the trend, it urges im- proved promotion, more hotel accom. modation, and new forms of holiday attractions and recreational facilities. It \"especially urges improvement in those facilities making greater use of historic buildings and stretches of countryside in the ownership of the State or of national institutions.\" Editorial Comment Page 12",

There were 1,648 cases in 1964 (against 440 in 1956) out of a total of 199,044 fires (123,168). Last year the cost of fires, started by arson which caused damage esti- mated at Â£10,000 or more, was Â£3.8m., or almost 10 per cent. of the total, compared with under Â£Lim. in 1962. The Fire Protection Association, giving these figures yesterday, stresses that each year there are hundreds more outbreaks where deliberate ignition is suspected but fire damage is sufficient to destroy the incriminat- ing. evidence. Another SPA survey on major but- breaks in 1965 shows that by July this r year the national fire bill stood at a record Â£86m. for the previous 12 months, Â£45m. of this being attribut- able to the 777 fires where damage of over Â£10,000 resulted.

   "text_content" : "From Our Common Market Correspondent STRASBOURG, Sept 27. Denmark's impatience to join the Conimon Market was pblicly aired here to-day by Danish Prime Minister Mr. Jea Otto Krag, who made It clear that he would be pressing his Scandinavian colleagues to join together in a Nordic move towards the Six. Stressing that the division of Europe into two different market groupings is creating growing difficulties for the smaller European countries, Mr. Krag said: \"We cannot wait for ever.\" But he added: \"1 do not think that an isolated Danish entry in the Common Market would solve Denmark's problems, nor would it be desirable from an overall Euro- pean point of view.\" Mr. Krag told the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe that he would be having talks on the subject with the Swedish Prime Minister. Mr. Erlander, in Copenhagen next week. The Presidium of the Nordic Council, which groups the Prime Ministers, would discuss it again in Reykjavik in December, and Mr. Kr\"g hoped that the matter would be taken up by the full Nordic Council in Finland in February. Though he had received the im- pression from his talks with Presi- dent de Gaulle in June that the French Government would wel- come Denmark as a member of the EEC, he was clearly not over- optimistic of the chances of a joint Nordic initiative. But he felt that it would act as an appeal to the U.K. and France to view the con- tacts which were broken off in January, 1963, and to resume the negotiations, in which Denmark took part simultaneously. Mr. Krog also told a Press confer- ence afterwards that he had been invited to speak at the Belian Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs in Brussels next month, and that he would take the opportunity to meet the members of the Common Market Council of Ministers, also scheduled to be meeting in Brussels then. Pn the question of a simultaneous entry of all the EFTA countries, Mr. Krag was more than a little reticent. He was confident that the British economic measures would solve the balance of payments difficulties, but he did not know if this would take one or two years, and he would not exclude the possibility of a Nordic initiative separate from Britain."

The combination of all these factors has landed what was once the richest party in Italy in a financial crisis. Furthermore the financial prospects are as gloomy as the political ones. The publishing activities of the Party are the first victims of the belt tightening process which has begun. The Communists are known to be seriously considering closing the Rome edition of their daily L'Unith and merging it with the Milan edition. Since earlier this month on Mondays it is no longer published in Rome. When the future looked really bright for the Communists, L'Unith was also pub- lished in Genoa and Turin. With the prospects of power receding into the distance the policies pursued, particularly in Southern Italy, in the last 20 years are undergoing bitter criticism within the Party.

   "text_content" : "LISBON, Sept. 27. From Our Own Correspondent PORTUGUESE hotelkeepers are con- sidering, without enthusiasm, an official suggestion that they might offer special reductions for out-of season and long-stay British visitors. The suggestion was made in recogni- tion of the importance of Britons to the rapidly expanding Portuguese tourist industry and of the fact that Britons are regarded here as tending to be \"quality tourists\" who leave behind them considerably more than Â£50. In the Algarve, where perhaps three out of four visitors to the best hotels tend to be British, many hotelkeepers, including those responsible for costly new Anglo-Portuguese establishments are alarmed at the possible results or the Â£50 limit. In the meantime, hotelkeepers are continuing their compaign, in a country where on average hotel prices are probably Europe's lowest, to se- cure official recognition for higher prices. Until increases are authorised many are neglecting to display official price lists and trying to avoid giving all-in terms for stays of less than five days (officially they must offer such terms for stays of 48 hours or more). It is easy to understand these re- actions, as the average price which a first class hotel is permitted to charge for full pension is less than Â£2 daily. To the hotelkeeper full pension means that he may charge the official price for room, breakfast and one principal meal. The second main meal, at an average price of 12s 6d at a first class hotel; is not charged -for. This Is to say that the hotel receives an average -1.70WAN 5. LI. of only 6s 3d for lunch or dinner from his \" full pension \" guests. The hoteliers claim that the raw materials alone which he will need for each such meal will cost him at least 10s. In most cases what the hotelkeeper loses on this roundabout he can, to a limited extent, hope to make up by being permitted to charge 3s 9d for a breakfast for which the raw materials seldom cost more than say Is 3d and from the, already in most cases modest, room prices. As a consequence of official price restrictions many new hotels are seek. ing the classification \"residential.\" This means that only bed and break. fast is offered and the . hotel restaurant is run \"independently.\" No such tariff as \" full pension,\" with its one free meal daily, then exists."

Mr. Wilson was opening his National Productivity Conference at Lancaster House, London. He began his 20-minute address by acknowledging that some had described the meeting as \" unfortunately timed.\" Others had suggested; more directly, that it was verging on sick humour to talk about increasing investment when many manu- facturers were drawing in their horns. He. wanted to meet this argument head on, Britain appeared to be capable of balancing her overseas payments when industry was working below capacity. But whenever an expan- sion of production bad been sought. to reach full capacity working and full employment, the nation had immediately lurched into a crisis. Dilemma for the Economy This was the dilemma that the economy had faced for many years. On each occasion, a rise in pro- duction had been followed within months by a new balance of pay- ments crisis. The Government regarded the measures it had taken this summer as preparing the way for expansion. and it intended to use them not as a prescription for stagnation but as a springboard. \"One of the main purposes of the ineasures taken,\" Mr. Wilson continued, \" is to secure a redeploy- ment of labour in areas where there is a continuing and expanding demand-namely the export mar- kets. and in the sectors of the economy most relevant to broaden- ing and strengthening our industrial base. \" And it is because this redeploy- ment is essential that however hard, however painful this is. the Govern ment have had to ask for the release of labour rather than the spreading of work.\" But bow could this lead to expansion, particularly of invest- ment? What guarantee was there that the nation would not once agaln, when it tried to expand, plunge into a fresh round of balance of payments problems? ADDITIONAL CAPACITY \"The answer,\" the Prime Minister declared. \"is that having harshly. painfully, created room for man. ceuvre in the deconomy, having released resources and made. more industriala pacity available tropig redeployment, it Is th ovr- ment's ontention that that capacity -be used now for the purpose of strengthening the economy. \" In the past, a period of uqder capacity working has been endedby. restoring demanQ tot the very god where Â»he cuts had been mae . \"The familiar pattern1-bit pur. chase had been restricted producioW t(:l , hire-purchase .fUacillet were restored and production the same goods ros aeain. \"We woul regard It is a major fuilure of Government policy, and a major failure by British industry if, at the end of thq day. we. were only able to fil the gap we have created by a feverish consumer boom. \"And while one purpose of expanded production must ultimatei be expanded soclal provision, aga n we do not see any solution to the problem of undercp sacty.

But even during the period of disinflation, the pation would be able to spend mdre on investment. He and his colleagues would give the \"fullest consideration \" to all the ideas that the conference members bad been working on for directed help to investment. Three main papers, dealing with investment, productivity techniques. and labour utilisation were put before the Prime Minister's National Pro- ductivity Conference in London yes- terday. GIVING THE BACKGROUND Each was prepared by the Nati6nal Economic Development Office in con- sultation with representatives of Gov. ernment Ministries, the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, and other bodies. The aim of the documents was to give delegates a background against which to discuss ways of raising output per man in a wide range of industries, and thus to improve the nation's efficiency. The first paper, Ã½which dealt with investment, said bluntly that there was reason for concern about the level.of spending on capital equipment in Britain. Even before the Government's recent measures, forecasts from more than one source indicated a possible decline in spending this year and nest. Limitation of Funds \"The case for maintaining invest- ient is strong.\" the paper stated. ' The Government's commitment to lon -term growth . strengthens it fuirther.

Evidence from managetent con- sultants showed the immense scope that still existed in industry for the application of modern work study techniques to work out the number of employees needed on a particular operation. In a host of industries the productive machinery-ranging from machine tools to sewing machines- was actually operating for less than half the available time. Critical Study of Products Products themselves should be examined as critically as the men and machines manufacturing them. Could they be redesigned to increase sales or cut production costs? A similar approach rould be applied to components. Scrap reduction was also an impor- tant objective in any action campaign for higher output. and marketing techniques should be- closely examined. \" As far as the firm is concerned,\" the paper added. \" the most important benefit to be derived from higher productivity during the next 12 months is that it increases the avail- ability of cash. \" To obtain more money from' the banks at the present time. if possible at all, is difficult and costly.\" A 20 per cent. reduction in stocks and work in progress, for example, could yield a saving nationally of 6ver Â£1.0Oum.-and suc- a reduction \" is far from impossible.\" One. of the briefest but most Intercsting of the papers dealt with the possibility of arranging a pilot scheme for experiments In plant barglaing, The document complained that joint consultative bodies at plant level were usually too much conr cerned with relatively minor issues. because the significant procsesa of negotiation and bargalntins were carried on elsewhere. \" If the processes of consultation and negotiation could be brought closer together, this, could create a new opportunity for positive co. operation between management and labour at the factory level and provide the conditions for a productivity advance.\" But esotlptlont on pay and lolntl consultatlon might \"oot Jae y to coalMpe tn any single koy.

Investment was stated to be a major factor in securing labour productivity even without direct reductions in manning scales. Larger production runs, better marketing and greater understanding of the economies of industrial operations were also cited as factors. PAST RISES IN OUTPUT In the past. output increases had stemmed from a combination of in- creases in production per head and an expansion of the working popula. tion. The second reason had been of great importance. The National Plan had expected the working population to rise between 1964 and 1970 by about 400.000. But revised projections now suggested an even slower rate of rise, bringing only about 250.000 extra workers in the same period. A large proportion of this new labour came in during 1964-66. so there was little scope for raising the supply over the next few years. After outlining the various results achieved by some companies in the productivity field, the NEPO con- cluded that results could actually be achieved in Britain and were \"not something indigenous to the pecullat circumstances of some other nation.\" Mobility of labour between places. jobs and industries was an essential concomitant of action to reduce overmanning at plant level. This was not to suggest that all mobility was good-some changing of jobs that took place could actually be inimical to higher productivity.

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent BOMBAY, Sept. 27. India will seek clarification of Washington reports that the World Bank no longer wishes to hold any pledging efi of the Aid-India Consortium, when te a jBltks Bell commences talks on the Indian economy with the Planning Commission in Delhi to-morrow. More than casual interest attaches to the new routid of'dis. cussions, because of India's growing disenchantment with thb current slant on the World Bank's aid policy. The talks are expected to be about as detailed and extensive as those which preceded the Bell Mis- sion's well-known recommendation for rupee devaluation. The mission will be strengthened later in the week, when the advance party will be joined by other experts, includ- ing Sir John Crawford, the Australian farming authority. Cynicism The arrival of the Bell Mission has been greeted with much cynicism in the Press, and preceded by some bitter comment at the Ernakulam session of the Congress, which brought out into the open the hitherto hidden disillusionment in the higher ranks of the ruling party. Apart from the Prime Minister's caustic remarks on the \"bad type of. pressures\" exercised by some foreign elements on Indian econo- mic and foreign policy, leading members of the high command and well-known industrialists referred to the \" devaluatidn brought about on false pretences\" and continued \" economic inquisition with promises of invisible aid.\" Behind this mounting wave of cynicism and bitterness lies, among other things, the unreported failure of negotiations for American col- laboration on India's 'emergency fertiliser development programme. The American International: Oil Company is believed to have failed to mobilise the loan of some S35m. Â· by September 15, as agreed. 'It: has asked for more neti, and as month's extension may be given. The Government fears that this is the beginning of new demands, and new hurdles in the way of the giant Madras fertiliser project. The American collaborators in the Goa fertiliser project are also reported to have sought new concessions, in- cluding protection from the free market in the southern region. These projects are now unlikely to keep to schedule, much to the disappointment of, the Food Minis- ter, who staked much'on devalua- tion and American capital partici- pation in the Indian fertiliser pro- gramme. The only sense of relief has been provided by the reported willing. ness of Japan to open formal nego- tiations with India for emergency assistance of some S40m. Japan is also likely to benefit from the Com- munist agitation in Kerala for a shipyard in Cochin. This project, which has been languishing for more 'than a de- cade, is likely to be revised in order to placate Kerala's sensitive poli- ticians, and Mitsubishi, who pre- pared details, will probably win the contract for the project, the cost of which has shot up from Rupees 420m. to an estimated Rupees 590m. since devaluation. The Prime Minister gave ample indications yesterday that she has been 'suitably impressed by the Communist demonstrations during I the Congress session. 1",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent SALISBURY, Sept. 27. it 'r *hnn The outcome of the Anglo-Rhodesian talks between the U.K. team, led by Mr. Herbert Bowden, the Commonwealth Secretary, and the Smith r6gime, was uncertain here to-day as the Brftish Ministers prepared to ly home. However, Mr. Ian Smith said that he was \" quite happy \" with the latest round of the talks. As far as he was concerned the talks were over, and he added that be was feeling fine. Asked if the end of the dispute was still in sight, Mr. Smith merely smiled. Most observers are convinced that the talks have failed mainly because of the failure to agree on the blocking mechanism that would entrench and ensure African ad- vancement towards majority rule. It is also clear that there is dis- agreement over other matters- notably the return to legality--but these are of.secondary importance. Mr. Bowden and Sir Elwyn Jones, the U.K. Attorney-General, to-day met delegations from the Association of Rhodesian Industry and the Rhodesia National Farmers Union. There was no meeting with representatives of commerce. Pro. minent Rhodesians who saw the British ministers to-day came away profoundly pessimistic about the outcome of the dispute. Independence Terms The key. point being discussed here is whether the British officials will agree to publication of the in- dependence terms. It is understood that, while the politicians are pre- pared to see the terms published, British officials are extremely nerv9us, because they believe that publication will only alienate African countries without changing the domestic situation here. It is clear that contact between officials was continued over the Â·I _L ~~;l~a~~o~lbecause they believe that will only' alienate African countries without changing the domestic situation'hcre. .It ir clear that contact between ~offi~ials`'wao continued.over the; week while Mr. Ian Smith was at the Rhodesian Front Congress in Bulawayo, and there is still specu- lation that the talks between offi- cials will continue. But it is under- stood that the entire British delega- tion will return to-morrow after Mr. Bowden holds his mid-day conference. It is understood here that Mr. Bowden will condemn the Rhode- sian Government's intransigence when he speaks at a Press con- ference to-morrow. Rhodesian observers foresee an escalation of the crisis. Mr. Maudling, the Con- servatives' Commonwealth spqkes- man, when he was in Salisbury, is understood to have much' more pessimistic views than those,which he expressed publicly. Mr. Maud- ling is believed to have warned that Mr. Smith's terms for Rhode- sian independence were unaccept- able to the Conservatives. All in all, to-day is seen as dead- lock day. While Mr. Smith claims to feel fine, the general feeling here is that the crunch has now been reached and people who saw Mr. Bowden believe that manda- tory sanctions will now be applied a good deal sooner than the end of year."

It was admitted that the coal position at present is \" criticalY due to the truck shortage.

The it seal of her adherence followed two h years of soul-searching delibera- a tion after President Leoni first b announced his Government's inten- a tion to join the club. Her late F entry six years after the treaty a was signed, has been generally I welcomed by the nine other Lafta members - apart from d Bolivia, Venezuela is the only f South American country still not t in the association. But there are c some indications that inside the v country opposition may continue to I the idea of whole-hearted .col- t laboration with Lafta. b Venezuela stands apart from s Its neighbours in South America in I a number of ways. One of the F most noteworthy is the resolute F opposition of its Government to d military regimes of any kind in e other Latin American countries: d the so-called Betancourt doctrine l which enshrines this principle has in fact led to the rupture of diplo- matic relations with both Argentina and Brazil, two of the three most powerful members of Lafta. On the economic front, Venezuela is at once more wealthy I and industrially less advanced s than the other leading Lafta I countries. It has foreign exchange t reserves of r850am.-the highest c per capita figure for any country I r b r o a ti IÂ· I a it o h ;t b Y \" Y L IrÂ· a d y f ,t t: e c e o D I I- i a r a I a P a I D d a e : d ii v I h s a 8 re t it c y I Id Ee ,n ut Â· Pd Id id Ip he he cc ng of mÂ· ~ul President Leoni in the world except Kuwat-and a permanently favourabl Aalance of trade, based on its pgstion as a leading oil exporter. But internal wage levels are high, partly because of the pull exerted. by the oil industry; and Venezuelan businessmen are afraid that they may not be able to com* pete if exposed suddenly to the full flood of competition from the industries of Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. The opposition to joining Lafta has been led by Fede- cameras, the association of Venezuelan chambers of con' merce, which is the most powerful I I i II .I 1i ' I businessmen's organisation in the a country. Before the final ratifica- i tion of Venezuelan. entry I Fedecamaras published a booklet i in which it argued that the risks i involved in Venezuela's entry were greater than those shouldered by any other member of the . association, including even Paraguay and Ecuador, the two . most backward members off Lafta. The booklet dwelt on the dangers of importing inflation I from countries like Brazil (where c the cost of living rose by 45 per cent. last year) or Argentina, where the rise was 38 per cent. I It reminded the Government that the Venezuelan Bolivar currency has only just achieved the enviable status of being adopted by the IMF as an international means of payment, and suggested that if President Leoni's Government was determined to push ahead with entry, it should insist on the intro- duction of some new principles into the Lafta agreement. Point by point bargaining One of these was that the Lafta tariff-cutting programme should be modified by a clause guaranteeing that existing indus- tries should be entitled to suffi- cient protection to enable them to produce at their levels of capacity. or at levels of capacity expected to be attained in the near future. A second \"principle\" would re- quire that each Lafta country should produce a \"definition\" of its economic policy. which would specify, among other things, how much of its domestic market was open to imports from other Lafta countries. A final sugges- tion by Fedecamaras was that emphasis should be. laid, in co- ordinating Lafta development plans, on increasing the output of goods at present imported from outside the free trade area. Whatever the Government may think about these suggestions it has been on safe ground so far .in claiming that Venezuela must wait to become a member of Lafta before it can start to propose radi- cal modifications in the Treaty of Montevideo. It has, however, undertaken to bargain point by point on every one of the products listed in the common and national lists under the Lafta treaty, and to consult the private sector on every product affecting the Vene- zuelan market. The Government's own view about Lafta is that Venezuela must enter it-or risk being left out of further and possibly more im- portant moves towards economic integration in Latin America. Venezuela is rapidly developing a steel industry, based on. the iron ore resources of the Guyana dia- I trict in the . west, and it has ambitious plans for a petrochemical industry using the country's own lavish oil resources. Both these industries are likely to be produc- ing at far more than the domestic level in the next few years. But the chances of placing their pro- ducts outside Latin America are obviously slim: it therefore be- comes necessary to secure a place for them as soon as possible inside Lafta. Another consideration which is bothering' the Government is that of Latin American markets for its oil. Owing to increased competi- tion land lower prices) from Russia and the Middle East. Vene- zuela has been rapidly losing its position in the markets of Brazil, Chile and Argentina, in which it was placing almost 100m. barrels of its oil only ten years ago. Oil happens to be one of the few pro- ducts on which most Latin Ameri- can countries maintain either no tariffs at all, or very low ones, which would seem to suggest that Lafta membership, on its own, will not do much to retrieve these lost markets. But there is no doubt that the Government hopes that, once it has joined, it will be able either collectively or by bilateral agreements to step up its sales to the rest of the continent. The immediate impact of Lafta membership is not likely to be very great, whatever the fears of the businessmen. During the first five years of Lafta's existence, Venezuela was taking only 2 per cent. of its imports from the association's members, and Lafta products accounted for only 850 tariff items out of a total of more than 3.700 listed in the Venezuelan trade returns. To jldge by the results achieved between other Lafta countries, the level 1 of trade will.remain fairly low for t some time after the treaty is * signed, even if the percentage in- c creases may look impressive. But i there is no doubt that Venezuela a has taken a step which in the long a , run could .have a rpdical effect on 1. its own economy and on those of i its neighbours.",

   "text_content" : ".BY Our Joizamuabawbu .r THE INITIAL impact of Whit- bread on the South African beer market has been considerable. Launched early in August, the Gold Crest lager produced at the new Â£4m. brewery of Whitbread South Africa is already well estab- lished on the Witwaterstand-South Africa's major beer market and the only market there that Whit- bread is at present attacking. Whitbread SA-owned as to 50 per cent. by Whitbr;ad U.K., 37Y, per cent. by the Afrikaner group. Oudemeester. and 12Y oer cent. by the Dutch Heinekin-faced several major problems in breaking into a market that has for many years been the virtual monopoly of the giant South African Breweries. Not the least of these problems was that of outlets. The link with Oudemeester partially solved the off-sales (bottle store) problem, but the overriding problem of pub sales was not greatly helped by the requirement of South African law that not less than thtee competing brands must be available in any outlet. That Gold Cret has seemingly won through to a considerable public acceptance (probably as much as 20 per cent. on the Rand -certainly up to \" our best expec- tations \" according to a Whitbread SA spokesman) is a tribute to the quality of the beer-and to the skill with which the . difficult \"launcb\" campaign was con- ducted. But this does not mean that it is now all plain sailing for Whit- bread's considerable South African investment. Two factors. beyond the calculatitnrs of the planners, have thrown a considerable spanner into the works. The first was Dr. Danges' recent Budget. In this, the duty on lager beer was raised by 23 cents to 74 cents a gallon-a 45 per cent. in- crease. The effect was that bottled beers (and the bulk of SA con- sumption is of bottled beers) pre- viously retailing at 16 cents auto- matically went up to 18 cents-and retailers, to protect their margins and provide for reduced sales, promptly added another I cent. So the retail price of beer rose, almost overnight. from 16 cents to 19 cents. This 184; per cent. increase is bound to have a marked impact on sales, particularly in a market where the lowly paid African con- sumes 40 per cent. of the total. Impartial observers expect beer consumption to fall by at least 10 r- ent- pe' ~c .~",

New opportunities in hitherto closed markets of big potential such as Spain and Turkey are being developed through the medium of local assembly and manufacture, a statement released yesterday by the corporation states. Turkish assembly In Spain, SAVA is manufactur- ing a range of BMC trucks specially adapted for local operat- ing conditions and during the past five years nearly 20,000 units have been delivered to the Spanish mar- ket through this project. An automated diesel engine manu- facturing plant has just been put into operation by SAVA at a cost of LÂ£m.. and commercial vehicle production is being expanded with capacity expected to be 20.000 vehicles a year by 1970. BMC is also due to begin commercial vehicle assembly very shortly in Turkey, with the first stage production set at 3,000 vehicles a year, rising as quickly as possible to an annual output of 13.000 units. Export demand for BMC's wide range of vans and trucks remains strong, but many countries abroad are facing economic difficulties similar to the U.K., making the promotion of an immediate and significant expansion in overseas business difficult to achieve. In the home market. over the first six months of 1966 BMC corp. mercial vehicle sales were running at about tiWe same rate as in 196l Since June however the Govern. ment's deflationary measures have inevitably begun to bite into demand."

GORRINGES department store yesterday launched a \"gift box\" export drive designed to encourage Americans to buy British for thelr Christmas gifts this year. It was given official blessing with 'an enthusiastic speech by Lord - Rhodes, Parliamentary Secretary Board of Trade. Lord Brown, Minister of State at the Board of Trade was to have offici- ated at the launching but was un- able to attend through -illness. Under the plan Gorringes has assembled more than 200 different gift sets, the best products of more than 30 British manufacturers. The sets will be on display in British boutiques set up in 40 top U.S. department stores, where they will be seen by millions of American Christmas shoppers. Catalogues In addition 311,000 American homes will receive a 32-page cata- logue illustrating the different gift sets. Orders received will be sown direct from London to anywhere in the U.S. By special arrangement with the PMG a battery of electric stamp cancelling machines and a team of PO sorters were used to despatch the huge mailing from London so that it could be sent in one con- gisnment on the Oueen Elizaheth sionmnt onthe O n Elzabet to be in American homes in the first week of October. The ceremony coincided with the air freighting of 700 sample gift sets for display in America. The sets range from platinum medallions commemorating Sir Winston Churchill to highland bagpipes; and from superfine Yorkshire woven worsteds to fine crystal. silver and china. A Gorringes' spokesman said that apart from the immediate dollar earning potential from the scheme. another aspect was that the products in the sets would become much better known to the American public.

   "text_content" : "From Our Energy Editor BILLINGHAM, Sept. 27. The Â£10m. oil refinery here built by Phillips-Imperial, a jointly owned subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries and U.S. PhMlips Petroleum, will be opened to-day by the Minister of Power, Mr. Richard Marsh. , It is the first major refinery to be built in the North East. The capacity is 4m. tons a year, but already Phillips-Imperial has acquired land on which further facilities may be built when necessary. The most important product is naphtha, which will account for Im. tons a year. It will go to neighbouring ICI plants here and at Wilton where it will be used in the manufacture of ammonia, ethylene and other petrochemical products. The refinery, however, will ,be unable to meet all ICI's naphtha requirements, and the company will continue to purchase supplies from the oil companies. A certain amount of petrol is pro- duced as a by-product in the petro- chemical operation and sold by ICI under the brand name Imperial. It now has about 100 outlets mainly in the North East, with a few in Scot- land. The crude oil for the refinery is supplied by Phillips from Algeria and to a lesser extent Libya. Phillips is also responsible for disposing of the other products-kerosene, diesel fuel, s. aiofnAI fuel nil-not uad by IWI an. Wnd W il-no usedhv I It sells most of them in the U.K. to commercial and industrial consumers but quantities worth between Â£3m. and Â£4m. a year will probably be exported. Th refinery does not produce petro and Ph has no immediate plans to enter the U.K. retail petrol market although it is willing to buy in small quantities in order to supply customers who are purchasing other products from the refineries. The Tees is one of the last of Britain's major rivers to be developed as a refinery centre. But its import. ance will be increased later this year when the Shell refinery under con- struction near the Phillips-lmperial plant comes on stream. To meet the needs of these plants the Tees Conservancy Commissioners are spending Â£4.5m. on widening and deepening the river to enable it to accommodate 60,000-ton tankers. The work will be completed by December I and the Phillips-Imperial jetties are designed to handle vessels of up to 80,000 tops so that further work on the river can be expected.",

   "text_content" : "From Our Own Correspondent BARCELONA, Sept. 27. One of the most urgent topics being discussed at this week's annual conference of the Inter- national Union of Marine Insur- ance here is the rapid growth of container traffic. In its report to the conference, the Carriers Liability Committee said that the structural changes in international transport caused by the use of containers call for the preparation of an inter- national convention. Carriers' liability towards con- signees and the limitation of liability must be settled in such a convention, the committee said. Meanwhile, said the committee, providers of container transport should, on a contractual basis, accept a limit of liability corre- sponding to the weight and size of the containers. The IUMI to-day announced the setting up of a new committee to consider the subject of General Aver- age which recently has been a topic of vexed discussion in marine insur- ance markets, particularly London. Dr. H. P. Rogaar (Netherlands), presi- dent of the union, said to-day he did not think formation of the new committee, which will consist of five members. including Britain, would result in the abolition of General Average, but there could be some quite useful simplification. It was revealed that Lloyd's and the insurance companies in Britain have made a joint approach to British Railways and have expressed concern at the growing incidence of loss of goods carried by rail in the U.K. The conference is being attended by some 500 delegates representing 37 member countris. member coun es.",

The problem of financing the scheme is likely to be. the main topic on this occasion, particularly in view of the French Prime Minister's manifest hesitancy on the point in his television broad- cast last night. M.

Both Britain and France were now agreed that it would be necessary to rely on foreln capital to a fairly large extent he explained.

Newer Devices Initially-. recruitmoent of \"ready-made \" electronic main- tenanee engineers was easy-the Services released -them in large numbers. A few years later. however, not only did this source begin tdry up, but'also conventional data procewing started to lose its lustre. JIC foresaw that eventually its ser- vicing force would be heavily oriented.towards the newer, elec- tronic devices. At the same time, computers * were reaching out, towards in- creased \"logical abilities,\" and therefore required in their main- tenance the kind of logical thought already;familiar to the man. working in the electre- mechanical Weld. ICT could thus draw on the right potential \"material,\" .prvided: the W aitn oiuld denqonstrat tht had an aptitude for The intn to be retrained can be of any age' up to about 50. Ispoke to some of the 200 who ar currently being processed at JCT's Letchworth engineer- in training school. One man, 27 and with 20 years' service, flow in the sixth week of a 12- cek course, found that even ath agz he could \" cope.\" I asked him wh he had decided to reshape s iorking lif and be .pled: \"I thought hid to took out for myself Next to Wm sat a 20-year- old, a. Scotsman with a \"senior secondary\" school background. e was learning a new trade because \"I want to get on to the computers they are more interesting. And. a 36-year-old, 16 ears with the firm, said: \"Wel, it's obvious\"-the company's future lies on the electronic side.\" He regarded ICT's retraining pro- ceedings as \"a very agreeable opportunity.\" Minimum Salary It was the man aged 47, with an elementary school and Army background, who agreed that he did it because it would bring in \" a few more pounds.\" The minimum salary for trained computer engineers with 12 months' service i.s Â£1,170, .that for electro- mechanical engineers is Â£1,001 a year. An \"established\" man, being retrained after years of company service, would, of course, be earning more already. \" In any case,\" this man added,\" it is a case of standing still or progressing.\" But it is not a question of simply drafting the men into re- training squads. The first step is for the \"conventional engineer to learn something about electronics under his own steam, which may take any- thing from a few months to several years. He can do this by a (company approved) correspondence course, and over 300 have made this choice -so far. Alternatively, he can go to night school, or he can study a set of six books issued by ICr, which nearly 500 have now done. Some are invited to take a preliminary course at the school. Next comes an aptitude test (devised by the National Insti- tute of Industrial Psychology and run by IC's personnel department) which measures the retraining candidate's speed, accuracy and persistence. Four weeks' practical training in elec- tronics at the school includes a one-hour theoretical test paper. This is normally the stage where the sheep are separated from the goats. Each candidate is cate- gorised and sent on a training course tailored towards specific machines ranging from eleco tronic calculators at one end to the large computers at the other. Perhaps one quarter \"make\" these large machines straight away, others take to the electronics road step by step. High Cost Thus the 200 men who are currently being retrained at Letchworth fall into as many as 12 categories. The correspond- ing courses take from nine to 26 weeks. And it -costs about Â£2,500 to retrain one man. \"This cost will rise still further as the equipment becomes bigger and more expensive,\" says ICT. A figure of Â£750,000 is probably a low estimate of the current \" sales value \" of the school's machines. Not that this change-over from conventional electro- mechanical to advanced elec- tronic expertise is the end of the retraining road. For one thing, even \"obsolete\" machines (in the manufacturing sense) must be serviced, and men have to be trained to do so. Secondly, \" you can't keep a man forever on the same type of equipment -ten years is the absolute limit,\" said the manager of ICT's engineering services orga- nisation. He added that a main. tenance engineer is now spend- ing 15 per cent. of his total ser- vice with the company in the engineering school. In future, this proportion is likely to rise to 20 per cent. or even more. In the course' of all this it is becoming apparent just how many men are in occupations far below their abilities-which may well be one significant aspect of the current \"English disease.\"",

Although the manual is of par- ticular importance to companies who make wide use of welded aluminium structures, it is almost an essential for designers in the material. It is available from Alcan In- dustries at Banbury, Oxfordshire.",

   "text_content" : "BY C. GORD..DN TEWTR IT IS SOMETHING. I suppose, that OECD's Working Party 3 managed in its recent report on the treatment of external payments disequilibrium to break through the commonsense barrier for enough to recognise-that there is a strong case for eMploy!ig direct controls to corret a deficit when quick results are essential. But it Is apity that it didn't take a closer look.at the question of whether such correctives could lot' also be employed with advantage in other circumstances. For it might well have discovered that the case for encouraging this was stronger than it had imagined-particularly now that advanced countries are be- ginning to experience great diffi- culty in getting expansion under way again after employing general economic restraints to deal with temporary distortions. The importance of the \"dis- covery\" made by Working Party 3 -which is OECD's top financial thinking mechanism-about the appropriateness of using direct measures when a balance of pay- meats position has to be speedily restored to health can be best Illustrated by relating it to the British situation in the closing months of 1964. With her overall payments gap running at a level of Â£800m. per annum and the near- certainty that the resulting revival of speculation about the possibility of a sterling devaluation would touch off a massive flight of funds from London. no country could ever have stood in greater need of a correctives programme capable of producing quick results than Britain did at that time. The British Case In the event, it was not forth- coming. Some direct action there was. But it was limited to the introduction of a tariff surcharge on foreign goods of such a modest kind that it operated as only the mildest of deterrents to import excesses, especially as the British authorities were falling over them- selves to make it clear that it would not last long. The Labour Govern- ment. though newly in office, could not have been unaware of the urgency of the payments problem. But it was evidently discouraged from resorting to quantitative im- port restrictions by the belief that a move of this kind would fly so much in the face of international economic orthodoxy that it would put the U.K. in very bad odour abroad. In the light of what happened subsequently, even those diehard devotees of orthodoxy that make up Working Party 3 could hardly deny that there may be occasions when 'it is manifestly in the in- terests of all concerned that a country in payments difficulties should make spbed the first priority in formulating its rehabill- II~P~ 9prnnlddoli tation p6lOiy. aui It Is a great pilty. a that the penny did not drop, so to -: speak, so mich sooner. For had Ii ., done so. the world could have been spared a sterling nightmare that has already lasted two years and d could go on for another year or d two yet. . , However, this is a field wher.ei \"' we must be grateful for small iier- \" cies. And as I said earlier, there-.- fore, it is a matter for some satis- i faction that Working Party 3 has \" not chosen to deny the lessons taught by the tragically incompe' - tent handling of the British ayments problem. The pity is that t t evidently came to the conclu- t sion that it had gone far enough in t the direction of a more realistic approach to the direct controls c issue once it had conceded that t there was something to be said for t employing them when quick results ( are essential. For there is no sug- gestion in its report that it has i looked into the case for encourag- ing countries in payments difficul- ties to seek relief through tempo- ; rary import restrictions when the problem is not so acute that ; reliance on slow-acting general , economic testraints would be as risky as it obviously was in the British case. I say there is no indication that i it investigated this highly impor- i tant aspect, of the balance of pay- . ments adjustment issue properly because, had it done so, it would i not have felt so justified in limit- i ing its approval of the use of direct I controls to circumstances wherein speed is essential. Orthodox opposi- I tion to this form of treatment for i balance of payments malaise is I based in the main on the theory that it is calculated to impede the growth of world trade to a greater extent than the use of general economic restraints. But this is hardly borne out by the available evidence. World Trade Growth Unfortunately, few countries have had the courage to pin their flag to the unorthodox mast in this matter. But one that has done so -South Africa-can claim to have contributed to the growth of world trade to a materially greater extent than the general run of countries during the 1960's. At the same time, it is the inconvenient truth that Britain-a country that has. the feeble tariff surcharge exercise apart, remained loyal to the ortho- dox approach in dealing with a whole series of balance of pay- ments deficits-has made a much less than average contribution to the expansion in the international trade over the same period. Thus,. over the past 12 months. Britain's imports have been run- ning about a third higher than they were in 1960. whereas the expan- sion in the imports o all countries between the two periods comes out at a good 50 per cent. Of course. since the clock cannot be turned back, it is impossible to. say for certain that the British performance would have been better given a dietrent approach to the payments deficit problem. But t seems reasonable to suppose that, had -economic growth not had to be held in check for such long periods of time to pievert imports outstrip. ping exports, the U.K. would by now be exporting on the scale needed to sustain a, very much larger volume of imports. Such case stodies do not, how- ever. provide the only reason for thinking that the interests of world trade expansion might be better served in future by sometimes en- couraging countries in payments trouble to employ direct remedies that are quick and reliable rather than indirect remedies of the fiscal and monetary restraints type that are both slow-acting and uncertain. One point brought out clearly by the experiences of France, Italy and Japan during the past few years is that in present conditions the economy that suffers a sharp application of the brakes is apt to find it very difficult to climb on to the expansion bandwagon again when the time for doing so arrives. In consequence, any interruption of the growth of its external trade produced by a general damping down of economic activity tends to be prolonged. Italy has been making considerable efforts to re- slate for some time now. But her import trade is still on(4 just about returning to the level at which it was running more than three years ago. The Main Criterion It is, of course, true that in some of the cases I have mentioned the decision to put the brake on economic activity was motivated more by internal considerations than by external payments ones. But the lesson the experiences of 'these countries has taught about the difficulty of getting expansion under way again in a modern context has no less significance on that account for the balance of payments adjustment issue. For what it suggests is that, in cases where a swing into external deficit is not accompanied by the development of internal dis- equilibrium of a really acute kind. there is a stronger case than ever for not resorting to a general retrenchment package to put -the balance of payments right. This is because by confining corrective action to the balance of payments field, a country will not only avoid unnecessary interference with its own economic growth. It will also minimise the impact of its rehabili- tation programme on international trkde by ensuring that any inter- ruption' of the Jrowth of its i imports will be of comparatively short duration.",

   "text_content" : "MR. WILSON faced an unenvi. able task at yesterday's National Productivity Conference, which even before it opened had been dismissed by the harsher critics as a publicity gimmick, and by the kinder ones as unfortunately timed after the squeeze of July 20. His task was made even more difficult by the fact that one of the best of the Conference papers, that on investment, read in places like an attack on the Government's deflationary measures. Home demand is weakening, the NEDO paper de- clares; and at the same time finance for investment is expen- sive add hard to find. Invest- ment programmes are therefore, in NEDO's view, likely to be trimmed, and with them the country's capacity for sustained growth. A favourite gambit In this situation Mr. Wilson used one of his favourite gam- bits. He incorporated his critics' views into his own speech, no doubt hoping that the sheer courage of this procedure would be taken by some as an effective rebuttal. The Prime Minister mentioned those who thought the Conference \" a sick joke,\" and even went,on to make a lengthy attack on traditional stop-go policies and their in- ability to prevent a renewed balance of payments crisis as soon as expansion is resumed. His explanation of why things should work out differently in the present cycle was. unfortu- nately, a shade less convincing. He claimed that the next reflation would be stimulated not by con- sumption or bigger Government social expenditure, but by increased investment. He referred to the Â£70m. aid for shipbuilding (a figure which is meant to be a very generous ceiling), the IRC, the dock modernisation programme and the Ministry of Technology's computer and research contracts. These are projects which were in the pipeline or had already started long before the July measures. Put on to a yearly basis, they will not add up to nearly enough to provide a sub- stitute for the traditional refla- tionary measures, such as HP relaxations or more public service spending, which Mr. Wilson claims to have rejected. Previous Conservative Prime Ministers, had they, possessed Mr. Wilson's dialectical skill in these matters, could equally have pointed to the cotton reorgani- sation paogramme, or the road building programmes, or dozens of other standard items in their programmes in just the same way. The one serious tew point in Mr. Wilson's speech was his hint of incentives to prevent private investment from falling too far. HIe mentioned various possible schemes, of which the most likely runners are larger and earlier investment grants. The Prime Minister went so, far as to say that we would be able to spend more on investment \" even dur- ing the period of disinflation.\" This cannot be taken literally, as private investment is certain to drop, whatever happens. But the sentence amounts to 'a pretty strong commitment to early Government financial action which could hardly have brought the Treasury much joy. Here again it is as well to remember that measures of this kind have been tried before. Mr. Wilson, with his well-knowtr memory for such events, will re- call how Mr. Heathcoat Amory increased \" initial allowances\" for investment in an Amendment to the 1958 Finance Bill. Mr. Maudling increased investment allowances in November, 1962. But neither move came in time to prevent a slump in manufac. turing investment which helped to sow the seeds of subsequent payments crises. Early action If the Government waits for the 1967 Budget to bring in new incentives, they will again come much too late to moderate the investment downturn. Invest- ment incentives can only have a marginal impact when business men are pessimistic about demand prospects; but if they are to have even this marginal impact they need to be brought in as early this autumn as possible, This is the kind of thing that \" If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.\""

   "text_content" : "..TImES C BEVERCOTES Colliery is an inoffensive colliction of yellow-brick and grey-clad buildings sitting on top of 100m. tons of saleable coal on the eastern edge of the Nottingham- shire coaield. At a casual glance it is hard to see how Â£l4m. could have been spent on constructing and equipping it, but that is the National Coal Board's estimate of the bill. The major part of that money-- Â£14m.--is not out of line with the cost of sinking a colliery any- where in the UX., and equipping it for mechanised production. The additional Â£4m. represents the cost of dressing it up as a guinea-pig mine, the NCB's 21st century colliery.\" The cause of the present em. barrassment of the Coal Board, and of the executive of the National Union of Mineworkers, is that, 15 months after being displayed to the Fourth Inter- national Mining Congress as an electronic showpiece, Bevercotes has still to produce its first ton of coal. There have been some techni- cal difflculties with the machi- nery, but the immediate cause of the hold-up is the failure of the NCB and the local miners to reach agreement on working con- ditions at the pit. The Board has put forward proposals, accepted by the union executive, and by the colliery's labour force, which would mean that the lower grades employed at Bevercotes would be rather better paid than Beverote Colliery, Britain's nt fuflygautonated pit. their colleagues at neighbouring collieries, although the face workers would receive very nmuch the same. These terms, however, have been rejected by the Nottinghamshire miners as a whole-at first, it was said, because they did not want to see a higher-paid dlite created, but now because they are against the principle of round-the-clock, seven-day-week working. The importance of Bevercotes to the Coal Board has rested almost as much upon getting across the idea that expensive modern plant must be fully utilised as upon its value as a test bed for new equipment. This head-on clash over a matter of principle is therefore an awk- ward matter to get round. Whether the Board decides to stick to its guns or concede the point may well be decided in the next few days. But it has also been suggested that the NUM executive might call a delegates' meeting at which progressive elements could over- rule the Nottinghamshire miners. In the meantime, it is interest- ing to see how Bevercotes fits into the British coal industry's plans for automation. The first big step came with the develop- meat of ROLF (remotely- operated loogwall face) equip. ment. Work had'begun, during the 1950s, on . designing a nucleonic device for steering a coal shearer across a coalface, and also on the remote control of self-advaicing supports, the goalpost-like structures which, by a system of hydraulic rams, can be walked forward to give protection as .the coal is ex. tracted. Accorditg to the indus- try's folklore, it* was Lord Robens who, on an early visit as chairmanof the NCB to research centres at Isleworth and Bretby, saw this initial work and com- manded an increased effort. The target he set was that within a year it must be possible to operate . the shearer, the armoured conveyor that runs across the coalface, and the self- advancing supports, from one console. It was done. Two full installa- tions, at Ormonde and Newstead collieries, went underground in January and February, 1963. From the research point of view, they were a great success - \"much greater,\" one, of the senior engineers told me this week, \"than we ever dreamed possible.\" This was the most advanced electronic equipment that had ever been exposed to the arduous conditions of coal- face working: after 3,000 cyclical operations only one transistor failure had been reported. Ormonde, classed as a \" produc- tion\" coalface (the Newstead ROLF was used on a more experimental basis) averaged 20 tons per manshift of saleable coal over a two-year period. At no point in time was this the most productive face in the country, although a fair average for a mechanised face is probably nearer 6 tons per manshift. But over the two years it was well and away the most consistent high-output face. Test Bed The next major stride forward was supposed to be Bevercotes. This was a colliery which had been sunk in the 1950s. It went into limited production in 1961 with a labour force of 450, but before 12 months had passed serious shaft troubles had developed, and the pit wept put of production. It was then ear- marked as the perfect sit6 for an experimental test bed for -all the new and very advanced ideas circulating within the industry and the research departments of the: equipment manufacturers. Not only would all coalfaces be remotely controlled, it was decided, but every operation in the colliery and its coal-prepara. tion, storage, and train'loading plants on the surface would be electronically monitored. The conveyors carrying the coal from the face to the automatic skips would have no men standing watch at transfer points: block. ages, overheating, and torn belt- ing would have to be detected electronically. Instead of employing 2,000 men, producing 1.25m. tons of coal a year, it was planned that a labour force of 770 would extract 1.Sm. tons a year. Again, Lord Robens wanted the do. velopment work carried out in a hurry, because the international mining convention of 1965 was to be held in Britain, and again the target date was met, more or less, after a very intensive I research programme, controlled through an elaborate committee system. '< 1 But Bevercotes has never got i going. The ROLF equipment I remains on the surface and can- not be installed until the pit is ready to go into production be. Â· cause it might be in some danger I underground: conditions on a i coalface that has been opened Â· up but is not being worked do- \\ teriorate rapidly. The labour * . force has been at half strength i (about 330 men) and has been employed for a year mainly on maintenance work and prepar. I ing the first two faces. Good Proposition Meanwhile, much of the eleo- tronic monitoring equipment developed for Bevercotes is being taken up by other collieries. It used to be said that the Coal ' Board would spend Â£5,000 on a piece of equipment if it would replace one man, and many of the new devices, being relatively cheap and extremely reliable, are a good proposition. One view I heard this week was that these devices . would be adopted throughout the country within a short time. The more expensive ROLP equipment has been making slower progress, despite the Coal Board chairman's oft-repeated statement that within a decade 100m. tons of coal a year will be < mined electronically. It had been hoped that by the end of this year 10 ROLF faces would be in operation, but a number of installations that were scheduled have fallen through - because severe geological faults have I appeared on the faces selected for the experiments. Depreciation Cost One installation that has'done extremely well is in a thin, 30-inch seam at Woolley Colliery in Yorkshire. In the first six months of this year it yielded 45,000 tons of saleable coal, at a productivity rating of 10 tons 12 cwts per manshift. On a neighbouring face, where the coal is a little thicker and there- fore mining conditions rather better, conventional equipment has given an output of 41,000 tons at 6 tons 12 cwts per man- shift. Wage costs per ton of coal have averaged 9s 3d on the ROLF face, 14s 3d on the con- iventional face. But here is the rub-the apparent saving of 55 a ton is wiped out by the higher depreciation costs on electronic mining. The ROLF equipment cost Â£247,000, the shearer, sup- ports, and ancillary gear on the neighbouring face only Â£140,000. Wth these sort of figures be. Continued on Page 19",

   "text_content" : "Sir,-The article, \"Getting Profits i into New Ideas\" (September 22), by George Cyriax, highlights the widespread misconception that the only worthwhile inventions are made and taken through to com- mercial success by large firms, 4 usually with some form of Govern- ment backing. 1 Practical, profitable, inventions I usually result from the solution of I problems which arise from time I to time in industry, after these 4 have been defined and analysed. The laboratories of large organisa- tions can be unaware of the r existence of many such problems, and small inventive firms are generally in a better position to recognise and overcome technical and commercial difficulties in the early stages of innovation. Too much research and develop- ment work tends to be directed into well defined channels. Mil- lions of pounds, for example, have been invested by the steel industry in developing improved steel sheets, so providing the opportunity for customers, such as the car industry, to make better end products. It has, however, neglected to pursue I the relatively inexpensive develop- I ment work required for making I more efficient roof cladding, for which there is a world marketing I potential, and continues to produce I the primitive corrugated sheet I which was first designed very many 4 years ago. 4 It is too readily assumed that technological breakthroughs and their development to considerable commercial success must always involve heavy financial Investment, although this may be true for science-based Industries, such as electronics and chemicals. Older industries have developed mainly from craft skills, and they have Invariably been built up by the mechanisation of such tech- niques. Solutions of technical problems, however, which might have been satisfactory enough in the conditions of earlier times. have often become the unchal- lenged basis for subsequent de- velopment work. (The ubiquitous hard-to-open tin can, for instance, is still made to a design evolved in the days of the travelling tinker, or tinsmith.) What some industries require is not large sums spent on research work of a scientific nature, but a re-thinking by technologists of basic problems in the light of present- day conditions, and the challenging of solutions which have become fossilised in the literature on the subject.

   "text_content" : "From Our Midlands Correspondent OXFORD. Sept. 27. Tb Mialstry of Labour Oie here has sent 2,000 lettn te .eployae within a 30-ale radlus to drum up as mana aat jobs as possilble for the Morris Motors and Presed Stol Fisher workers who will be dismrsed In November. Oficials have still to be told by British Motor Corporation ex4ctIy how many will be made redundant, but are confident that the organisation to deal with the situation is as good as can be adviM. - up UwsVea. Arrangements have been made to call on extra staff locally-and in the neighbouring counties if necessary-to help man depart- ments that will set up within the factories affected to mterview the redundant on the spot. Pessimism Some union officials, however, seem ignorant of the comprehen- siveness of these arrangements, and there is a good deal of pessimism ,about the possibility of their mem- bers finding other jobs. Mr. Malcolm Young, district secretary of the Almagamated Engineering Union, is one who feels bitter about the effects of the Government' measures. \"These, we are told, are designed to squeeze workers out of the service in- dustries into yital exporting in- dustries. \" But here in Oxford, it is ironic that the workers who are being squeezed out of a top exporting industry will most likely find other jobs-if indeed they do-in the service industries. There aren't many engineering jobs going. Already one of the bigger com- panies in the city is on short time. \"This is a one-industry town. economically tied to cars, and many of the engineering firms in the district also send a lot of their production to tbe motor industry. Such jobs as there are are mainly on the buses, in catering, hotels and so on. In any case, even before redundancy starts, there are as many unemployed in Oxford as there are vacancies.\" This view, which is echoed by other union officials and workers, is an overstatement. But it helps to explain why shop floor workers are feeling militant about the dismissals. A Ministry of Labour official put the situation as he saw it. It was true, he said, that at the September count, there were 500 unemployed, and only 400 vacan- cies-and unfilled jobs were shrinking. But for years there had been a severe shortage of skilled men in service industries that could be claimed to be vital. These in- cluded, for instance, such as transport, dustmen and local authority workers. The percentage unemployed was still only just above Y per cent, and while 500 were on the register, experience showed that 100-150 of them normally found jobs within a few days. The Ministry recognised that neither Oxford, nor perhaps the immediate district around, were going to provide all the jobs needed. But there were oppor- tunities within the radius of places from which car workers travelled.",

U.K.'s determination It was felt in Whitehall yesterday that the full strength of Britain's determination on this point is at last beginning to dawn on the rest of her allies in NATO. Both NATO and the Western European Union have already been informed that when Britain decides to withdraw forces from Germany they will be consulted about how to reach the target of saving foreign exchange in a way least damaging to the Alliance. The latest mov4 in economic measures, being taken indepent dently of any West German agreement of foreign exchange assistance, is the decision to wind up the British base in Antwerp through which most of the supplies for the Rhine Army are shipped. It has been decided that the forces in Germany have almost three times as much equipment as they require for any role they might be called upon to play. The cutting down of supplies and the closing of the Antwerp base will result in the saving of Â£15m. a year in foreign exchange, resulting from the dismissal of a substantial number of Belgian and German employees. Only British soldiers would be left to deal with the limited amount of traffic for the Rhipe Army through Antwerp. This would include the shipment home of tanks for repair instead of having them repaired in Germany. A further saving of Â£5m. a year in foreign exchange will also be made by limiting the amount of -consumer purchases in Germany by the families of British forces stationed there.",

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter THE SMALL stockbroking Arm of Marx and Co., which has six partners, was \" hammered \" on the London Stock Exchange yesterday. An official statement said that Edward John Marx, Thomas William Stagnell, John William Oross Michael Stuart MaoGregor, David Anthony Franklin and Derrick' Graham Mendelssohn. trading as Marx and Co., had informed the Council that they were unable to comply with their bargains. Yesterday was settle. ment day on the Stock Exchange. . N6 estimate was available of the amount involved In the failure. but rumour put it at a relatively modest sum. The Stock Exchange has a compensation fund of about Â£700,000, which provides protec* tion for the public. The failure had no visible impact on the market. The Official Aslugnee's Department which takes over the estates of defaulters, was quickly off the mark with a list of \"hammer\" prices. These are prices, displayed in the House, at which all members having aoocounts open with a defaulter must close their transactions with him. The list comprised about 50 Industrial, Oil and Mining stocks Marx and Co. was established _Â· in 1952. Its senior partner, Mr. E. J. Marx, has been a member of the Stock Exchange since 1933. In December, 1964, the Stock Ex- change Council suspended the firm for a month for permitting \"deallngs to take place without due care in such a way as to assist in the promotion of a false market in the shares of H. W. Phillips and Co. between June 7, 1963, and October 9, 1964.\" Messrs. A. Carroll-Marx and Co., another firm of Stock Ex- change brokers, pointed out yes- terday that they were in no way connected with Marx and Co."

   "text_content" : "Pha mu~n Rep ,~ i\": IN THE LAST few years, multi- storey, off-street car parks have at last begun to spring up in London. National Car. Parks now owns or operates 15, and plans another 15 in the next 18 months, while two overseas companies, the. U.S. Meyer Brothers and City, Paking of Toronto, halve begun to invest their know-how in Britain through associates. But the pic- ture of off-street parking in London, although rosier than a few years ago, is not altogether happy. Private enterprise is going ahead only cautiously and, as one company put it\" the locai boroughs all have dreams which they cannot afford to realise.\" One of the basic troubles is that the GLC, which took over responsibility - for London's parking in 1963, will not be pro- ducing an off-street parking policy until publication of the Greater London Development Plan in two or three years' time. Before then, parking companies and local authorities must work in the dark, operating in a policy vacuum labelled \"the more parking space the better.\" Not Satisfactory The problem facing both the GLC and the parking deve- lopers can be summed up simply. Multi-storey car parks. which everyone agrees are necessary and desirable, cost a considerable amount of money, and the 10 per cent. maximum gross return that they offer is not many people's idea of a satisfactory investment. In the meantime, the public has come to regard the streets as the rightful home for their cars. Unless they can be forced by legislation to park their cars off the streets they' will continue to leave them there. And unless the private developers are assured that the public will be forced to use their car parks they will refuse to build them. As a result, private developers are loath to build on the scale that is needed; and if a local authority does try to clear its streets, as Westminster did in Belgravia earlier this year. it is met with righteous anger from local residents, demanding to know just where their cars are to go. On the face of it, there ought to be an easy case to make to a potential developer for build- ing off-street car parks. Central London is already meter con- trolled during office hours, and increased meter charges in many areas have made it more profit- able to park off the street than to feed (illegally) a meter throughout the day. Earlier this year, the OLQ announded its plan to create an Inner London Parking Area (ILPA) from Hammersmith to Bermondsey and from Camden Town to Brixton, all of which will be meter controlled, and which will presumably create an even preater need for off-street park- ing. Btt the picture presented by the developers does not confirm this optimum. The public takes time to aoclimatise itself to the whole idea of off-street parking, with the result that most com- panies deliberately charge less than economic rates for the first two years of operation, and then gradually break the public in to payins more. NCPS new \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 350-car park underneath Cado- $an Square, for instance, which s costing Â£500,000 to build. will ultimately charge Â£250 a year for a permanent parking space. But for the first year, this figure will be cut to Â£200. NCP readily admits that at present its bomb site car parks of which it has 85 in London, are far more profitable ventures than its multi-storey ones. But as specialists in parking, it believes it should invest in future needs. Meanwhile, Lex Garages has not felt able to invest in a new multi-storey park for five years, although it has taken on the management of two built by the City of London. Both the City of London and Westminster Councils have been building some multi-storey parks, to be operated under varying terms by private com- panies. Westminster's Â£1m. Hyde Park garage, with room for 1,100 cars, has now a through- put of 7,000 cars a week. There were losses in the early stages,\" says the council, \"but now things are settling down.\" Westminster's somewhat ambitious idea is to service the loans with which it builds car parks with its surplus revenue from parking meters. This revenue, it hopes, will tide over the unprofitable period at thb beginning of a multi-storey ear park's life, until it is earnia enough money to pay for itelf. Such, then, is the unfriendly picture that awaits any off-street car parking developer at present. The GLC is said to have dreams of eliminating all night-time parking on the streets in the far distant future. Its Development Plan will need to come up with radical solutions if such a dream is ever to be realised. In the related field of on- street parking, however, the OLC is now more firmly set on course. \" In principle, we would like to see the price mechanism bite on private car parking space.\" It does not want cars to drive into London in the morning and out again at night, having in the meantime paid no parking fees, whether the car are left on the street or in a company garage. Through the price mechanism, it hopes to divert commuter car traffic on to public transport, if not for the whole of the journey, at least for the last part of it. The controlled zone of ILPA will be designed to do just this. On-street parking- sites will be provided for resi- dents, at a charge of at least Is a day. Commuters will either have, to park off the streets, or else leave their cars outside ILPA, or in special car parks provided near main line stations. All these plans make bad reading for the motorist. Tak-. ing ILPA as a whole, there is room for all the cars that use London to park in. But Lon- don's motorists have a habit of converging on certain areas at certain times of day. In the near future, they are either going to have to pay heavily for their privileges, or ese accept that a morning's drive to the outskirts is as far as their private transport can ecoqoml- cally carry them.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR COMPANY STAFF There it ample evidence of the squeeze at: work in to-day's company announcements with J1sa. Lalgx showing a sharp fall in half-year profits (see Lex Page 1). Bristol Plant Hire reducing the interim dividend and a cut in the BtoIa Bayley Steels half- time payment, while Vlyela has had to revise its profit projiec- tions (see Lex). But Jaeger has had a good first half and Evane (Outbrea) is keeping ahead. Jaeger The half*year statement from *Jalger was sufficient to put the shares 9d higher yesterday at 12s 6d, and understandably so. Tfrogvei for the first six months is '11.6 per cent, up, overseas sales are more than a fifth better and pretax profits at Â£83.000 are 49. per cent. higher. The group iseems to have beei particularly skilful in gtetting its styles right so far this year. However,, the year's outc6me rests largely on the last six months which produce the bulk of profits. Obviously a cold autumn and early winter would boost sales, and the current period will benefit from new shops opened earlier this year while die success in exports mar- kets is particularly useful. Assum- ing second half-year profits merely equal the comparable period last year, total pre-tax profits would be some 10 per cent. up-at Â£632,000 to cover a maintained 15 per cent. dividend 1.7 times. The shares now yield 6 per cent. and sell on a prospective P/E ratio of only 9.7:1 Plantation Holdings The 1965 report of Plantation Holdinos contains three main points. The first is that the group is determined to improve margins. The London organisation is being tightened up with the acquisition of Bousted Brothers, probably worth IY points to earnings initially and more when reorganisa- tion is complete. The decision to * capitalise replanting expenditure 'is also important. Secondly, splitting Brooklands in 'half to satisfy the minority holders is not golr.- to be as painful as at first thought. Obviously. the minority holders are not keen to take the estates that are hardest to sell. so it looks as though they will get most of the immature areas. This means that Plantation holdings will retain the older areas. but most of the current profits. The third point concerns the group's lans to sell off certain estates to ocal interests, with an eye to exploring activities other than those directly related to rubber. But is this the kind of operation P.H. shareholders would, or indeed should, go for? Clearly, instead of hard, cash something just as attractive will have to be offered. Otherwise a return of capital, thus lightening the equity. and the burden of gross dividends under' corporation tax, is the only sen- sible course. At 2s the shares yield 18% per cent. Evans (Outsizes)' Although the half-year figures of Evans (Outslzes) look quite respect- able-with a pre-tax increase of, some 3 per cent. to Â£236.000-it is apparent that margins have taken a turn for the worse. Sales are about 6 per cent, higher, but the profits' Increase previously kept comfortably ahead of sales. Steps have been taken to deal with rising costs which include Â£10,000 for SET, so it seems reasonable to hope for the same level of profits this year, but the dividend looks awkward. Last May a maintained 30 per cent. total was forecast on capital enlarged by the 1-for-7 scrip issue. This is contrary to the letter of the freeze, but the same interim of 10 per cent. is declared and the total will take account of Government regulations \"applying at the time.\" Assuming a scaled- down payment of 261/* centr the shares look fully Valued, sel- ling at around 17 times earnings at 35s 9d and yielding 3.7 per cent. G. & M. Power Plant A rise of only 6 per cent. to Â£143,000 in the 1965-66 'pre-tax profits of G. and M. Power Plant might be regarded as a shade dis- appointlng in the light of the rapid . 0owth seein earuer years But he fall of Is to 18s in the share price yesterday was due mainly to rofitakin following a good rise n frot of e results. Th group, principally manufacturers and sup- pliers of lightweight generating equipment, still looks capable of moving forward despite the \"squeeze., Demand for its equipment for use in the commercial field is still keeping up, and 0, and M. has a fairly big expor trade, with over- seas sales probably accounting for well over 20\"per cent. of total' turn- over. Economic events could check the advance in some sectors at home, but at present the group is understood to have plenty of work on hand. Cash flow position is very satisfactory with a main- tained 25 per cent. dividend covered 2.3 times; and with the medium and long-term outlook cheerful the yield of 5.7 per cent. on the shares. selling 7.7 times earnings, seems reasonable. Barber Textile Rationalisation at Barber Tex- tile Corporation seems to be making an impact, both on profits and depreciation. For 1965-66 pre- tax profits-after higher deprecia- tion-are Â£93,000 against Â£55,000, but still below the Â£127,000 earned in 1963-64. But at least the maintained 10 per cent. dividend is now covered-I.I times. The interesting point, however, is that the group is effectively paying an additional 1% per cent. by bring- itig forward a first interim' distribu- tion on account of 1966-67, nor- mally payable in April. This, on the face of it, does look to be breaking the letter of the freeze. The question facing Barber Tex- tile in the current year is whether the benefits of its past modernisa- tion will offset the less encouraging factors. The group is well equipped to meet the problems, but the past record may hold the price in check. Yield at 2s 104d is 8.8 per cent. Glenlivet Glenvlet and Glen Grant's profits are up from Â£319,000 to Â£381,000 before tax, slightly less than the half-year figures indicated but sales, of bottled whisky were concentrated in the early months. Earnings are 43.5 per cent. and the dividend effectively unchanged at 24 per cent. The new third distillery operated to capacity last year and Slans to increase its output are in and. However, profits are unlikely to increase as a result in the cur- rent year. At 36s 6d to yield 3.3 per cent. and selling at 16.7 times earn- ings, the Glenlivet share price is geared to more growth.

   "text_content" : "Group profit of John Laing and Son, building and civil engineering contractors, fell sharply from Â£806,000 to Â£512,000 for the half-year to June 30, 1966, and the directors foreshadow a further fall in the secnrd halt. , Most major sections of the U.K. business were le profitable during the period and while the general level of production re mained high there was under-utilisation of the industrialised system building facilities, the directors state. Labour shortage has led to sub- stantial increases in the cost of employing such labour and this has contributed materially to reduced margins in the construc- tion field, while the setback In the private housing market has ad- versely affected the . company's building product and private housing activities. The directors advise that the con. tinuation of those conditions, together with the effects of SET, are now being felt, and indicate that the results for the second half of the year are to be expected to show a further fall, and that ore-tax profts for the full year, \" will be very much below last year's level.\" The half-year's profit was struck after, Increased depreciation of Â£633,000 (Â£425,000) and tax nll (Â£68,000). An interim dividend will be con. sidered, as usual, in mid-November. For 1965 a total of 10 per cent. was made In two equal payments. Mr. W.K. Laing I chairman.

VIC HALLAM'S PROGRESS Generally speaking the trading position of Vie Hallae is \"quite healthy.\" Turnover is running on ian almost equal level to 1965 and the total for the year may be similar, but under present conditions the directors consider it would not be prudent to forecast the profit and dividend for 1966. The company has \"worked harder for lepss rofit during the frmt half. year. Group profits for the siW months to June 30, 1966, are approxti mately 240,000 before tax, and it has been decided to maintain the Interim dividend at 6 per cent. The 1965 total was 14 per cent. Increased costs have acceleratbd, as forecast, with a consequent tion n margins. Long-term, xed priced contracts were rticularly affected, but where posble ender prieen have been adjusted bering In mind that \"we are always in a competitive market-lncrealngly during the present credit squee,\" the directors add.

At- AI) -. - He adds that the directors are confident of continuing to meet \"whateer. formula\" the British holidaymaker may require, and of attracting sufficient campers to ensure successful operation in the years ahead. The decision taken three or four years ago not to enter the Continental holiday market, and to expand and consolidate the existing type of busi- ness in Gt.

It is Mr. Warner's opinion, more- over, that there will. for many years, remain a high proportion of holiday- makers who prefer to stay nearer home. Mr. Warner points out that the jobs tax is likely to cost some Â£40,000 in a full year. Endeavour will be made to recoup this as far as possible by increasing the number of customers still further. As reported on September 7, gross revenue advanced from Â£1.86m. -to Â£2.16m. in the year to March 31, 1966, and the pre-tax balance from Â£320,868 to Â£330,232.

Taking the difficulties into con- sideration, an improving position is foreseen but it is difficult to judge the effects of the economic crisis and the measures that may have to be taken to overcome the problems. The major portion of the factory reorganisation is now complete. There were unexpected delays in completing the work, particularly in installing certain systems of production control, and the planned output became three months n arrears. Expansion all round Mr. Walker says the policy is to expand turnover in new products and recent developments, while still seek- ing improvement in the traditional textile machinery markets where pros. pects are promising. But circumstances may well force the Board to limit its search for certain types of orders in order to keep output within the capacity to produce, finance and deliver on time. \" Too much \" of the order book is perhaps in textile machinery products to Pakistan where the company is weln booked ahead for tradinal ,machinery..

An opportu- nity is being taken to improve that department, which was left until the end of the reorganisation planning. As stated on September 23.group profit for the year ended March 31, 1966, was Â£76,340 (Â£32,783) before any reorganisation cost which may be attributable to the current year, and the dividend is held at 10 per cent. The decision' to defer payment of the dividend until December 30 was made because of the need to pay tax on it to the Inland Revenue (although no tax is charged against profits in view of past losses), the introduction of the jobs tax which will cost some Â£20,000 before repayment starts and the need to conserve cash for trad- ing development in the export market. It is proposed to raise the non- executive directors' fees from Â£500 to Â£1,000 annually per person, but the increase will be waived for the period of the wage freeze provided that is generally observed throughout the company.

   "text_content" : "BY OUR LEGAL STAFF Ourw copanI audihors, aftr having rfud to reaigH, ow re fuse to a-i he s ew andltors with the &iat inflormton ie their posseslon What do you advise us to do? In view of the refusal of the former auditors to resign, we pre- sume that you have carried out the necessary drill to remove them from their position: see Companies Act, 1948,' s. 159 (1) (b). It will have been necessary to pass a resolution at the AGM expressly appointing somebody in their place, or resolving that they shall not be re-appointed, after carrying out the formal steps, which involve giving special notice: S. 160. Other- wise, however much or little the company likes it, they remain in office. If you have carried through the formal steps, and the old auditors refuse to supply the new ones with information, we would suggest that in the first instance you report the matter to their professional body or bodies; this will usually be the most effective thing you can do. Failing that, you will have to bring an action for delivery up of such papers as belong to the company, but that is the only relief you can get by law. The new auditors will have to pick the matter up from the end of the last balance-sheet prepared by the old auditors. ENFORCEABLE? Will you please advise me what percentage of votlna shares IN a publile company would be re- anired to enforce the Boad. of t company to give considera- ems to matters which one deemed of importance? The answer is - sufficient to remove the Board and appoint new directors in their place-that is, anything over 50 per cent. For the Board is elected to run the company, and, at any rate so long as there is no question of fraud or mala sides. its commercial decisions cannot be challenged effectively by any minority interest in the company. The only way to force a change of outlook is to remove the Board, and replace them by others, and this requires the passing of an ordinary resolu- tion of which special notice has previously been given to the company. AGRICULTURAL We own a field let to a farmer for grazing many years ago, but we hope eventually to get permission to build on It In the meantime we consider we should have a properly drawn up contract with the farmer so that we can Rain possession of the ield by giving sx months' notice. Is such an Sweemeat possilble? e farmer is at the moment protected by the Agricultural Hold- ings Act, 1948; you can obtain possession only on one years' __ __ notice unless the tenancy expressly provides that you can give le when you require the land for some purpose other than that of agriculture. There is no reason why the farmer should agree to such a curtailment. In addition, notices to quit normally need th sanction of the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, but notices given on the grounds that possession is required for some purpose other than agri- culture for which planning permie- sion has been given or is not re- quired are valid without such con- sent, provided the facts are stated in the notice. RENT RISE I have been a tessat of my preales for 30 years, and have received from the new owner notice of Increased rent of. over 1l00. Do the latest strictlo- perait the landlord to do tle The new landlord cannot In- crease the rent just like that. We assume that you use the premises let to you for business purposes, and so your occupation is - tected by Part of the Lanord and Tenant Act, 1954. The land- -lord can bring your rent up to the market rent, but, as a first step, he must serve you with notice to quit in a statutory form. You can then make application to the County Court for a new lease. This can be for up to 14 years, but it will be at the market rent. disregarding any goodwill attached to your bust- ness. Of course, there is no reason why you should not agree upon a proper rent out of court. This in no way conflicts with the latest restrictions; if you have been paying rent less than the market rent, you have been getting a bar- gain to which you have no claim. WORK ABROAD I am working aboard a British. owned and registered yacht which It b Intended should stay in the Mediterrnean four years. What 1i the Income-tax position?

This is assuming that it is an understood term of your employment that this will continue only so long as the yacht remains abroad. Your wages will in these circum- stances not be subject to U.K. tax.

   "text_content" : "By CHRISTOPHER TUGENDHAT, Our Energy Editor When the Minister of Power, Mr. Richard Marsh, officially opens Phillips-Imperial's new refinery on the north bank of the River Tees to-day he will be participating in an industrial development programme which began in 1920. In that year Brunner Mond, one of the forerunners of ICI, acquired a site at Billingham for a fertiliser plant, and so laid the foundations of the enormous chemical complex which now plays such a vital part in the area's economic life. From ser- tilisers it has expanded into industrial chemicals, building products, plastics and synthetic fibres. At first coal was the principal raw material, but over the years oil has been becoming increas- \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ingly Important The change. over bean after the war with the establishment of the petro- leum-ceiiical operations at, Wilton, and the importance of oil was greatly increased in 1962. after the development of a new method of making synthesis gas for the manufacture of ammonia. Partner Wanted Initially the company was able to meet all its requirements by purchasing supplies-from the oil companies, and from a small Im. tons a year crude distillation plant. However, by 1964 it was apparent that something far larger was needed, and the Board was ficed with the choice of either entering the oil business on its own account or finding an oil company to act as its partner. f Many, oil companies, led by j Shell,have in recent years been I Sgoing into chemicals, and it i would not have been surprising 1 I ICI had moved in the reverse 1 ' direction. But the Board took a the view that it did wot want ICr < to' become a producer and ' refiner of crude oil, and looked instead for an oil company with ] available supplie..of 4crude oil, 4 Sanda the distribution facilities to i *dispose of those refined products I that will, not be needed in ICI's chemical plants.- I So an alliance was formed 1 with the Phillips Petroleum Com-. I pany of. Oklahoma. In June, i 1 1964, the two companies an- 1 nounced plans for .building a 4m. tons refinery be added to i the existing ICI unit,and in the following .onth they set up a jointly owned subsidiary calletd SPhillipssmperi t,.to buand run it. In April, 1965,Phillips- Imperial purchased the existing ICI unit. Thus when Mr. Marsh appears on Tees-side he will be confronted with a complete 5m.-tons refinery. The interests of ICI and I Phillips dovetail very conveni- ently. ICI's main requirement is for naphtha. a light pbtroleum product akin to petrol, for its operations at both Billingham and Wilton, and it does not want .so have to dispose of the full. rainge of petroleum products Swhich a refinery must inevitably produce. Libyan Reserves Phillips has large reserves of Libyan crude, which is very light and so particularly suit- able for naphtha production. At the same time it is anxious to break into the U.K. market and will sell the other products pro- duced by the refinery through its wholly owned subsidiary Phillips Petroleum Products to commercial and industrial con- sumers throughout the. country. The only exception to this neat division of responsibility is petrol. Phillips has no desire to enter the retail petrol market at the 'moment, although it is pre- pared to supply those consumers who are buying other products and need some petrol to \"com- plete a package.\" ICI, however, is left with a certain amount of petrol produced as a by-product in its chemical' works, and in- stead of selling this off to the oil companies as used to be the, case it last year started disposing of it to customers able to make bulk purchases. In practice this frequently means the owners of cut price filling stations in the north of England and Scotland. The PhiHpom.perinp refinery from the ar. Â· Â·r r; Â·Â·., ,, i ~ In the U.S. Phillips is well known as a leading independent oil company, a major producer of natural gas, and as a chemi- cal company. In Europe it is still a relative newcomer, al- though it already has interests throughout most of the western part of the Continent Britain is an area to which it has devoted particular attention. In addition to its 50 per cent. share in Phillips-Imperial it has a half share with Tarmac in Philmac Oils, which is building a refinery near Liverpool for the production of asphalt for high- way construction. It also has a long-term contract with the Eastern Gas Board for the supply of propane, deliveries of which are expected to reach 1.4m. barrels during 1966. They come from the Texas Gulf coast in a specially refrigerated tanker, called the Paul Ezidacott, and are delivered into the largest storage terminal of its kind in Europe at Felixstowe. North Sea Find But its best-known operation is in the North Sea. In May the Phillips group found what is hoped will turn out to be a large feld in block 49/6. As well as gas the well contains condensate,, a form of extra high-gravity oil used in the production of lique- fied petroleum gas from which propylene is derived. This is a vital chemical feedstock used in the manufacture' of detergents, synthetic fibres and plastics. Phillips is the operator for the group and owns 35 per cent. of the shares, the rest being distri- buted among one of the most diverse. colections of the com- panics involved in the North Sea. Apart from two other oil companies, Petrofina and Agip, there is I.C. Gas, the Industrial and General Trust, the' Max Rayne interests, .Tarmac, Cour- taulds, and a number of banks including the. Ionian and Klein- wort Benson. ICI is. also interested in the North Sea, but, is a member of a different group. Its partners are Burmah and the U.S. Murphy Corporation, and so far it has not found anything. At present its platform the Ocean Prince is drillinig in block 48/22. Although the Phillips-Imperial refinery is the first to be built on the Tees it will soon be joined by one belonging to Shell, which is already under construction and due to come onstream in 1967. Whether or not others fol- low will depend on the avail- ability of land and water, and various other factors, but it would not be surprising if more projects are announced. The Tees and the Humber are both only just starting to be developed as refining areas, and the Tees in particular has the advantage Ã½of a large industrial hinterland. > At first it was thought that the river might be placed .at a dis- advantage because of its in- ability to take large tankers, but the Tees Conservancy Commis- sioners are now engaged in a far-reaching programme for deepening the main river channel which will enable tank- ers of 65,000 tons to dischatge at the refinery jetties. By mod- ern standards these are relatively small yet they should be large ' enough to give the companies concerned most of the advan. tages of bulk transport.",

   "text_content" : "By L. W. YOUNG GENERAL MANAGER, PHILLIPS-IMPERIAL PETROLEUM LIMITED The new Phillips-Imperial re- finery on Teesside is the first to be built in Britain to produce a varied range of products under the joint ownership of a British and an American company, the first in this country to be speci- fically designed for operation on North.African crude oil, and the first major refinery to be built on the North-East coast. It marks the beginning of a new eta for Teesside in that the estuary will become an important oil port capable of handling 60,000-tdn- and ultimnately larger-tankers. .The unit is designed to process up to 90,000 barrels a day of crude. oil and was built by Parsons Power Gas. The crude is supplied by Phillips from North Africa. The naphtha pro- duction is taken by ICI as feed- stock for its petrochemicals :operations and Phillips markets the gas oil, derv, kerosene and fuel oil through a wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips Petroleum Products. The site of the new 4m.-thns- a-year refinery. is on reclaimed land on the north bank of the Tees, adjacent to the lm.-tons-a- year crude distillation unit built by ICI in 1963. This unit was purchased by Phillips-Imperial Petroleum in April, 1965, and later integrated with the new unit. Advantages of the site include its proximity to ICI's petro- chemicals complex at Wilton and Billingham .to which naphtha can be piped, and the possibility of having the river widened and deepened to take large tankers. The heavy industry in the area provides a potential market for fuel oil. Boiling Control The complete, integrated re- finery employs conventional dis- tillation techniques except that in the new part steam stripping is not used to control the boiling range of products to meet speci- fications. Instead the products are reboiled. Crude from storage is pre- heated by heat exchange with overhead vapour from the main fractionator and the pre-flash tower before being subjectedito electrostatic desalting. After further preheating in series by the sidestream products and the reduced crude from the main fractionator, it is flashed in the pre-flash tower, releasing water and some light ends, thus reduc- ing the load on the furnace and the main tower. The vapour from the pre-flash tower is mixed with the over- heads from the main fractiona- tor. The liquid from the pre- flash tower is preheated further by heat exchange with reduced crude and then charged to the crude furnace to be heated and partially vaporised to meet the design conditions of the main fractionator. In addition to being used as a preheat medium reduced crude is used to generate steam at 150 p.s.i.g. and 60 p.s.i.g. in kettle boilers. To ensure complete dryness, all the sidestream pro- ducts are reboiled, by product heat exchange on all but the bottom sidestream, which is re- boiled in a separate coil in the main furnace. Final cooling of all products is by air. The crude fe6d and prodiuct' storage and distribution systems of the two units are integrate4di 240,000 cubic metres of convent tional tankage being provided. Considerable additional storage is available, underground in worked-out salt wells. Electricity is purchased from the North Eastern Electricity Boar4 and water from the Tees Valley and Cleveland Water Board. Water Safeguards The site services include chemical treatment of aqueous effluents before discharge into the river, and' oll/water separa- tors of the latest type, which can handle not only effluents but also the deballasting of ships, so that only clean water is ditcharged to the river. A great advantage of North African crude oils compared with many others is that they have a very low sulphur content and so yield fuels of high quality which cause less atmospheric pollution. The refinery burns its own waste gas and very low sulphur fuel oil. thus causing minimal atmospheric pollution locally. As the jetty belonging to the original 1C refinery was not able to accommodate large tankers, a new one has been built to deal with ships of up to 60.000 d.w. tons at present, with provision for ultimately handling vessels of up to 80,000 d.w. tons. The jetty is 242 ft long, with \"strong points\" 32 ft wide at each end to transmit the berthing forces back to slag embankments. The strong points are connected by. 10-ft.' wide access bays to the 60-ft-wide centre section which supports the hose rig structure. The jetty deck of 2-ft-thick reinforced concrete is supported on steel piles which ar ' fllnd With con- crete and cathodically protected, and also are coated with tar epoxy paint above low water level. There is an access way from the shore for vehicles servicing the tankers. The 60 ft. high hose handling structure is fitted with pneu- matically operated hoses - five 12\" and two 8\"-for handling crude oil at up to 5,000 tons/ hour and products at up to 2.000 tons/hour. The two 60- ton bollards on the jetty deck are served by pneumatically operated capstans, while the on- shore bollards-two of 60-ton and four of 120-ton capacity -are served by electrically operated capstans and fitted with Brown-Lennox quick re- lease hooks, Services provided on the jetty- inclde bunkering and de-ballasting facilities. The main contractors for the jetty were Cementation Con- struction, to a design by Harris and Sutherland; the hose hand- ling equipmont was provided by Globe Pneuatic Engirtneering.

Products distributed by sea are exported from the refinery jetty; the remainder are piped from the refinery tankage and cavity storage to the road and rail. ter- minal two miles away, where they can be \"inline\" blended into one of the seven blend tanks, of total capacity 17,000 cubic metres. The terminal has four islands, each with two road vehicles, loading points, and a large tanker can be loaded in 17 minutes, at a rate of approxi- mately 300 gallons per minute for all products. Terminal Loading Rail tankers can be loaded at approximately 1.200 gallons per minute, and the rail facilities, which at present itclude three 2,000 feet long sidings, are de- signed to .handle block trains of up to 1,000 tons of product. Single point top loading has been adopted to permit flexibility in handling a range of tank car sizes. Fuel oil is also conveyed by pipeline, via the Tees tunnel, to major customers on the south bank of the river. An office block on the termi- nal site houses central control rooms, the quality control labora- tory for all refinery products and the commercial and distribution staff. The main contractor for the terminal was Tarmac Civil Engineering, Mechanical Divi- sion. With the emergence of the river Tees as a major oil port, and the growing demand for oil products as raw materials, new projects are constantly under re- view to increase the range of products that Phillips-Imperial Petroleum can produce, and it is of significance that the inte- grated site is large enough for the refinery and its ancillary facilities to be extended as neces- sary to meet growing demand for its products. A tanker unloading crude oil at Phillips-Imperal Petroleum's recently completed Teemside refinery. It will be officially opened by Mr. Richard Marsh, the Minister of Power, to-day. Designed to handle 4m. tons of crude oil annhally, the refinery has jetty facilties and its own road and rail terminal.",

   "text_content" : "By W. A. M. EDWARDS GENERAL MANAGER, I.C.I. PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICALS DEPARTMENT Naphtha, the lightest of the liquid fractions obtained from petroleum, has come into promi- nence during the last decade as a raw material for petrochemical manufacture. In a relatively short space of time it has become the source of a substantial part of the world's ethylene, propy- lene, butadiene, benzene, xylenes and ammonia supplies and thus indirectly of a wide range of end products embracing pvc, poly- ethylene, polypropylene, syn- thetic rubbers, nylon, polyester and acrylic fibres and nitro- genous fertilisers. Naphtha is also well known in Britain as a starting point for the manufacture of town gas by new low-cost methods. It may perhaps be rather less familiar in its traditional role as a source of motor spirit, though this, as well as being the oldest, is still by far the largest outlet. World Pattern The present position of naphtha as a key raw material is the outcome of a series of developments. Before and during the war the U.S. built up a sub- stantial petrochemical industry on the basis of cheap natural gas and the light hydrocarbon oils frequently associated with it. In the remainder of the industrial world the choice of raw material was turned in a different direc- tion by the absence of compar- able natural gas supplies and the rapid post-war expansion in capacity for refining low-cost Middle East crude. Naphtha, gas oil, fuel oil and even crude oil itself, became potential raw materials for petrochemical pro- duction. The catalytic reforming of naphtha, introduced in order to upgrade it for motor spirit use, was the obvious starting point for the production of additional r r 1 3 I I I 1 t v I I, t I benzene, toluene and xylenes as soon as demand exceeded the supplies available aia by.product. of toal carbonisation operations. There was also an early prefer- ence on technical grounds for naphtha for the co-production of tylene, propylene and buta- Sdine by cracking. Research Stimulus Increased interest in its use developed, during the 1950s. The ability of Middle East fuel oils to supply the rapidly increasing energy requirements of the Eastern Remisph4re more econo mically than coal led to a growth in demand for the heavier pro- ducts, which was not .matched by the growth in demand for -motor spirit. The resulting ten- dency to surplus of naphtha stimulated research into its use and led in turn to a number of process developments, of which steam reforming of naphtha for ammonia and methanol produc- tion may be singled out, since * steam reforming technology proved also adaptable to the production of town gas. The opportunity presented was. as indicated earlier, followed up energetically by the Gas Boards. To-day, all the main petro- chemical intermediates are accessible from naphtha and consudiption for their manufac- t ture has now risen to the region I of 20m. tons a year outside the 1 U.S. Britain, the Continent and Japan are the main consuming areas. Gradually rising prices for natural gas and associated t liquids in the U.S. have recently led U.S. petrochemical producers to consider the use of naphtha themselves. At the beginning of this year U.S. crude oil import restrictions which protect the domestic crude oil industry and incidentally result in a high price for domestic naphtha were modi- Sfied to permit each petrochemical t manufacturer a modest quota of I imported naphtha. Larger quotas conversion of the gas industry. Clearly it is right that this in- dustry should build its future on indigenous gas rather than on Imported oils, troublesome and expensive though the change may be. An equally obvious development is use of the gas in place of naphtha for ammonia production, which would like- wise reduce imports. The change in this instance could be made quickly and would be free of the problems which arise from the fluctuating demand characteristic of domestic and commercial consumption. It seems probable also that a price for gas could be arranged which would be both satisfactory to the producers and helpful In im- proving Britain's competitive position. Supply Question Looked at in a world context the use of natural gas in place of manufactured gas and for ammonia production In the area bordering the North Sea appears as a local development of llmited signflcance. Naphtha demands for other petrochemical purposes will continue to increae rapidly. Indeed It seeme not unrmioable to expeet that th current con- sumption of some ;Om. tons/year of naphtha for these purposes will be trebled or even quad- rupld ,during the next decade, benze urren tolueinge and xylenes as sooit may bsde, theandrefore, that the uspplie available a a becrodct even fcoal carbonisation operations. hmore was also an early prefer- ene on toehnical grounds for European Gas napthat foincrthe co-pasing qductionties of Etbyle, propylene .and -buta- dinatural gas cracking.

The resulting ten- dency- to surplus of naphtha stimulated research into its use and led in turn to a number of process developments, of which steam reforming of naphtha for ammonia and methanol produc- tion may be singled out, since * steam reforming technology proved also adaptable to the production of town gas. The opportunity presented was. as indicated earlier, followed up energetically by the Gas Boards. To-day, all the main petro- chemical intermediates are accessible from naphtha and consurhption for their manufac- ture has now risen to the region of 20m. tons a year outside the U.S. Britain, the Continent and Japan are the main consuming areas. Gradually rising prices for natural gas and associated liquids in the U.S. have recently led U.S. petrochemical producers to consider the use of naphtha themselves. At the beginning of this year U.S. crude oil import restrictions which protect the domestic crude oil industry and incidentally result in a high price for domestic naphtha were modi- fied to permit each petrochemical manufacturer a modest quota of imported naphtha. Larger quotas are currently being advocated and it may be, therefore, that the use of naphtha will become even more widespread. European Gas It is something of a paradox that. increasing quantities of natural gas are now becoming available in Western Europe, the first centre of naphtha consump. tion for petrochemical use. The Dutch gas and most of that so far discovered in the North Sea is \"dry\" and thus less versatile in its application than that typi. cally available In the U.S., but Dutch ammonia production has already been switched to natural gas. Britain's attention at the moment is conceuntratedÂ« nn fthe wnicn mnmealiteiy prompts me question whether the necessary supplies will be available. Projection of petroleum pro. duct demands so far forwnrti, over such a wide area, is an exercise which even the oil com' panies approach with diflldenoe. A few rough ngiures do, how. over, suggest that total naphtha requlrements for petrochemical and motor spirit production will not be far away from the naphtha content of the crude oil then distilled. Crude oil consumption outside the U.S. is already over 750m. Sons/y*er and may be approach The crude ltonikely to contain over 20 per cent. naphtha. Thus some 300m. toni/year of The pre-fash tower where a vapourised light naphtha product is taken overhead and combined with the light naphtha product of the main fractionator tower. naphtha should be available at this time. In comparison gaso- line demands in the same area might be 200/250m. tpnslyear and demand for naphtha for petrochemical use say 70m. tons/ year. As is well known, refiners have considerable flexibility to increase the output of light products should this be required, notably by the cracking of heavy frac- tions to produce motor spirit. Light fractions production in the U.S. amounts to approximately 40 per cent. of throughput. Future price trends are equally difficult to evaluate. Should, however, there be any large, long-term increase in the price of naphtha, there is hardly any doubt that the petrochemical industry will once again adapt its technology. The possibilities are constantly under investigation.",

   "text_content" : "By ELWOOD LAYFIELD VICE-PiESIDENT, THE RALPH M. PARSONS POMPANY, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.; MANAGING DIRECTOR, PARSONS POWERGAS LTD. People who know the North East of England and its change- able weather will appreciate some of the problems of the principal contractor during the constractloa of the new Phillips. Imperalreflnery on North Tees. side, which was erected. during one of the wettest and windiest winters the locality had known for 50 years. Apart from weather many other problems were of course involved and to appreciate more fully the difficulties facing the contractor on site, some basic. contracting resp9nsibilities shtould prhaps be mentioned. Design and Effort The main contractor's func- tions include not only the design tad necessary effort to produce an installation capable of meeting operating require- tteats, but also all procurement of the plant and equipmeht, th6, design of pressure vessels, pip ing, specification of pumps, heat exchangers and special equip- ment, . instrumentation, civil works and electrical engineering aspects and so on. The ontractor must also make ceirtain that equipment being supplic4 meets the specifi- cation and requirements and the tenders for its supply must be, carefully considered and evaluatid. Again, delivery schedules must be 'continually checked and programmed, so that site work delays are mini- mised. In a nutshell, the contractor's rotlea to produce a basic design and, translate it into a working installation capable of manufac- turing , petroleum products econoriically. Process Capacity Designed to process up to 4m. ; tons of crude per year (90,000 barrels per day), the refinery will produce naphtha which is piped direct to the ICI plants at Billingham and Wilton Storage area of the roadralnl terminal. for, use in the company's petro- chemical operations, while the remaining products, including kerosenes, diesel fuels, gas oils and fuel oils, will be marketed by Phillips Petroleum Products. In addition ti the main pro- - ssing facility--which includes the crude fractionating column, .a side-stream stripper, a pre-flash tower, a crude heater, heat ex- chandge trains - and air, cooled heat exchangers--Parsons Power- gas was also responsible for considerable offsite work, in. cluding crude and product stor. age. Five large storage tanks for crude and finished products were erected and a total of 200.000 feet of pipework was designed and installed. The pipework connects the process area to sur- face and underground storage facilities and to a deep water jetty built to accomimodate ocean going tankers up to 60,000 tons d.w.. Piping was also laid to a road-rail terminal where road tankers and block trains are loaded. Work Planning Before ,sitework commenced in January, 1965, a critical path analysis was drawn up for the work programme. Programming of this nature, employing electronic computer techniques, is widely used ,on petroleum engineering projects. By assigning a reference to each activity, from the design of individual components and piping runs through procurement to final construction and erection, it is possible to main- tain throughout the project an exact picture of present and expected future progress. In this way effort can be directed where it is most needed to ensure smooth progress of the con- struction work. Although critical path programming is an essential part of modern construction methods, extensive personnel effort must also be employed to inspect and continuously expedite orders which have been placed on suppliers. One of the engineering problems presented by the North Teesside site is that it is located on reclaimed land-which meant 1 that to accommodate heavy 4 engineering components it was I necessary for all the major units I to be carried on piling, and a I total of 200 piles were driven down to a depth of 25 feet. Initial major construction I effort concerned the erection of i kerosene and fuel oil tanks. , These were mounted on tank pads formed from slag topped with asphalt; to ensure good drainage and a solid base be- neath the tanks, the area under each tank was stabilised by sand 'piling,. an operation which in- volved a high degr of specia- lised \"know-how\" and equip- ment. Labour Force Duting the peak construction period well over 500 construc- tion personnel, recruited from a large area of South Durham and North Yorkshire and including fitters, welders, steel work erec- tors and labourers, were engaged on the site. Buses were organ- ised for transport and regular services operated from Stockton, Hebburn - on - Tyne and the Hartlepools. Concrete was mixed by means of an on-site batch plant supple- mented with a local ready-mix service delivered by truck. The first foundations in the process area were started in the early summer of 1965 .for the crude heater and were completed at a later stage, being built over caps and beams tied into concrete piles driven through the unstable surface into the soil below. All in a Day The erection of the distillation column posed several problems owing to its weight and overall size. The unit, measuring 117 feet by 18 feet 6 inches diameter and weighing 90 tons, was de- livered on site in four sections, where it was assembled. It was then suspended by two 100-ton cranes over the steel foundation work which was assembled be- neath the column. The column was lowered by crane into posi- tion, the total operation being completed in one working day, the four corner posts of the foundations being carried on groups of concrete piles. The completed plant, which has been fully tested prior io handing over, provides yet an- other good example of Anglo. American industrial partnership.

   "text_content" : "Financial Times Reporter The West Midlands Gas Board was \" Imprudent \" when drawing up its 1964 capital development programme, and that contributed to the gas cuts last winter according to a ranntd an the shnarnass nhlliLahail k-daun. Sir Robert Wynne-Edwards, who prepared the report for the Minister of Power, says the programme allowed too small a margin for the winter of 1965.66 and although this was changed in the following year, it was too late to help last winter. The findings of the report have been accepted by Mr. Richard Marsh, the Minister, who' has said there are many valuable lessons to be learned from it. He has com. mended it to the Gas Council and Area Boards which \"are actively pursuing the suggestions made.\" One matter on which Sir Robert was not satisfied was the commis* sroning of new plants. These were normally intended to be In opera- tion In time for the winter demand which led to a tendency to time contracts so that mechanical com- pletion was scheduled for the autumn, A three-month's period should, however, he allowed for commis. sloning which would mean qom- p well before production was Coleshill Plant One of the Wet Mid had been thal.i ts new na tipton plts were not t My to3' ' r ion' earr on 66 cslgonÃ½ in&. perlihaf operate o6b1,0 are imost inCilt,\" says r, \"Moll heder fallret for Insitnce h oesre early (ne life ot pants Â»e rnedit, ingf 14la o wr n lehl Tlon w htd ( wunt 1ye r Comm lipsenlineer.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN IL WITH NOEL MURLESS' two year-olds in seemingly invincible form, there is not much doubt that Fleet, with Lester Piggott in the saddle, will start favourite for the Cheveley Park Stakes (3.20) at Newmarket this afternoon. This bay filly by Immortality, out of the 1,000 Guineas runner-up Review, cost Mr. R. C. Boucher 9,600 guineas at last year's October Yearling Sales, and recovered almost Â£2,000 of that outlay when winning the Princess Margaret Stakes at Ascot in July. Pla is a game and attractive filly,. who will be better suited by the sum furlongs here than by .the five furlongs over which she won the Lowther Stakes at York, though, judged on earlier running, there is little to choose between her and St. Pauli Girl. And a knowleds- able observer who was at Yarmouth the other day formed a high opinion of In Command. However, a suggested solution to a difficult problem is to back Negotiator each way. Negotiator, a full sister to last year's 1,000 Guineas winner, Night Off, im pressed in the paddock at Ascot before the Princess Margaret Stakes, and, though backward in condition, ran extremely well to finish third. 3% lengths behind Fleet. This was her first and only race, and she looked to have more scope for improvement than any of her opponents. Earlier this afternoon, Mr. L. B. Holliday, the owner of Negotiator, is likely to take the Lowther Stakes (2.0) with Piok M' Up, a convincing winner of -the Ripon St. Leger Trial Stakes -at the beginning of August. In fat, had the Sefton Course, over which this race is run, been watetd, I would rate him a good thing. : Fontex, with C. Williams laim. ing the five po'unds allowance, is capable of conceding weight all round in the Stayers' Three-Year- Old Handicap (3.50), though he, too, would prefer some give in the ground. And Privy Seal, who put the cat among the pigeons when defeating 34 opponents over seven furlongs at the Doncaster St. Leger meeting, appears to be reasonably treated with 8 st 9 lbs in the Rowley Mile Nursery Handicap (4.20). If Murless and Piggott do not win the Cheveley Park Stakes with Fleet, the partnership is likely to obtain some compensation with Zahedan in the Great Eastern Handicap (4.50). This grey colt by Abernant comes from one of the fastest families in the stud book, and provided that he lasts out six furlongs he ought to win here. The Buckenham Stakes (2.40) for two-year-olds that have never run is not a race on which to risk money, though I am told that Sebastapol showed a certain amount of promise in gallops at Newmwrket, and will win races. At Beverley, La Lidia, though no great shakes, is capable of taking the Willeaby Maiden Fillies Plate (2.0). Food for Thought Page 24",

   "text_content" : "From Our Scientific Correspondent , POOLE. Sept. 27. Plessey's Automation Group has started building a Â£1.5m. administrative block here to keep pace with the growth rate which is now around 40 per cent, each year. Within the next four years, staff at Poole will have risen to a total of 5,000 from 1,800 at present. The Group is expanding into many fields, including traflfic control. In addition to having two road traffic. contracts for West London and Liverpool, the company is in discussion with local authorities on three other computer control schemes. Specifications for traffic systems are in hand for 24 overseas cities -70 per cent. in Western Europe. The market outside the U.S. for the immediate future is put at Â£60m., but Plessey points out that export success depends very much on the way traffic automation is accepted in Britain. 5% Time Saving The Road Research Laboratory has calculated that a 5 per cent. time saving at a busy intersection justifies an expenditure of Â£10,000 for each set of lights, giving a yield of 10 per cent, on the investment to road users. The market is a tough one, how- ever, and Mr. H. E. C. Nash, the Group Director, points out that the money, spent on tendering by the seven companies active in this field very often exceeds the worth of the actual contract. The Group believes it has an excellent market for a very high-speed electronic mail sorter developed by its Australian associate, capable of tackling 3m. letters daily. Machines of this type were put into the Redfern Exchange, which was opened In Australla earlier this year. Based on its work under the Government's advanced computer techniques project to make very high, speed and compact circuits, P has built a tiny computer-the XL 'l -with an incredible performance for its size, Work is in progress further to reduce costs by shortening and reducing the number of interconnewo tions between the active portion of the various circuits. If the project succeeds, It will reslt in establishing an Integrated olroelit system particularlv suitable for auto. mated manufacture. For slower systems than computers, but offering the possibility of much more complex clrcuits at very low prices there Is the metal oxide semi conductor work which has alread led to development of tiny photo-cellI only one seventy-thouanh of inch square.

He added that a number of important projects were at present under consideration. Sir Robert Maclean, chairman of the Industrial Estates Corporation of Scotland, when asked if any of its tenants were being affected by the squeeze, said: \".So far as I know, the squeeze has only had a very mild effect.

   "text_content" : "\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all,\" wrote Oscar Wilde in the preface to Dorian Gray, a rather badly written book. Joe Orton's Loot is a singularly well written comedy, but it will have to run the gauntlet of a lot of criti- cism on the score of its morality. It contains, for example, a run- ning attack on the police, who are represented, through the person of the detective Truscott, as being brutal, stupid and venal. I can come back and say that in my ex- perience the police are none of these things; but this is not the point. Mr. Orton, who never seems to tire of telling us about his six months in the Scrubs, thinks they are; and from this standpoint he is able to construct clever situa- tions and cunningly-drawn charac- ters. That, as Wilde says, is all; we may disagree with Mr. Orton's opinions, but it's another thing altogether to let them obscure his skill. What is conventionally regarded as \"bad taste\" proliferates throughout the play. The plot, or one thread of it, deals with two young delinquents who remove their mother's body from her coffin and hide the proceeds of a bank robbery there. There are jokes about death, jokes about religion; a coffin, or a corpse, is on the stage all the evening. But the jokes are remarkably good ones, the coffin and the corpse play a vital part in a story as ingenious as it is hilarious. Let those who are sure they could never laugh at jokes about death or religion not go (and let them not go to The Mousetrap or Never Say Die or Three Men for Colverlon or Wait Until Dark or Arsenic and Old Lace or The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie either); they will miss one of the best comedies to come to London for a long time. The other thread of the plot concerns the police's suspicion that the dead woman was killed by her nurse so that she could marry the widower. As this nurse has been involved in seven similar cases before, they have reason for their doubts; but to prove them they must investigate the corpse for traces of poison, and the corpse has already been replaced by the money. It is characteristic of Mr. Orton that the conclusion of a series of neatly organised crises finds all the wrongdoers free and the one innocent character, the simple, devout, Catholic husband. under arrest. Charles Marowitz has seized with delight on the anti-authority aspect of the play in his direction; I think he overplays it, but this is a small point. He has got some lovely performances from his cast, best of all from Michael Bates as the detective, a superlatively comic bit of work. Mr. Bates and Simon Ward, very good as the natty young undertaker's assistant in- volved in the robbery, arc the only two who really have the knack of speaking Mr. Orton's very indivi- dual dialogue, which is com- pounded as often from formulae as from single words-\" thieving from slot machines and deflower- ing the daughters of better men than yourself,\" \"said to have belonged originally to a well-loved figure of the concert platform.\" If you speak a formula as if you recognise it to be a formula, you lose the comic effect it has when used as a part of current speech. Mr. Bates and Mr. Ward realise this; the others not quite so com- pletely. All the same, Sheila Ballan- tine is very funny as the homi- cidal nurse and Kenneth Cranham as the other boy, while Gerry Duggan puts real pathos into the sad figure of the bereaved old man. There is still room for all of them to speed up the quick ripostes of the dialogue. The Jeanetta Cochrane, by the way, appears in the small theatre advertisement under Cochrane.",

   "text_content" : "by RONALD CRICHTON Klemperer not being fully re- covered yet from his accident, the New Philharmonia were forced to look elsewhere for conductors for their Beethoven concerts. Pierre Boulez appeared last night and will conduct two performances of the Ninth Symphony at the end of the cycle. It was interesting to hear Boulez conduct Beethoven so soon after his series of mixed but mainly modern Proms. The result was predictably stimulating and intelli- gent. not entirely convincing but infinitely preferable to safe routine. This programme consisted of the Second and Fifth Symphonies and the Third Piano Concerto. Since neither symphony-not even the Fifth-is being overplayed at the moment, it became almost a voyage of discovery. The Second was the most consistently satisfy- ing, with great vitality tempered but not swamped by elegance, well- rounded tone with sharply defined accents to propel the music for. ward, and a general feeling that conductor and orchestra were happy. The Fifth had the same vitality and the same firm texture, into which Boulez at moments let un- accustomed light, as in the open- ing of the first movement develop. ment where clarinets and bassoons wail with long-hold notes behind the strings-a passage that he made to sound uncommonly eerie. Brass and double basses were admirably solid but. though there was no lack of rhythmic life, one missed the steady pulse of Klemperer and the just, inevitable proportions of his readings. Boulez repeated the scherzo and trio (Justified or not the repeat was welcome because they were strikingly played) but not the finale's exposition. This some- what shifted the balance between Playhouse at the Goose Fair A Nottingham Playhouse Com- pany led by John Neville is to pear at Nottingham's Goose Fair, one of the country's largest and oldest fairs, on October 6. 7 and 8.

It will be entirely appro- priate to Goose Pair and wJl be soon on the Goose Pair's own terms. At the same time t will be a fair sample of some of the work which can be seen In this theatre. Maurice Ruben., a Playhouse design assistant, has designed the frontage, which will be mounted on the show tent. It will provide a montage of lights, colour and re. fnloctons, and incorporate a plat. form from which the barkers will assemble the audlanees, Inside there will be music, demonstratlons of slapstick tech- niqu s, musIc hal and revue numb 6s, John Nevlll preenting paussag from Alfi and surprise guest artists on Saturday night. the movements and underlined a certain loss of power towards the end of the finale. The soloist in the C minor con- certo was Rudolf Firkusny, playing immaculately but not going deep beneath the surface of the music. The Largo was decorative, with only a glance or two at the music's inwardness. Firkusny was at his most effec- tive in the Rondo, setting a relaxed tempo that saved the main theme, one of Beethoven's less lovable ideas. from becoming over- emphatic as it often does. One had expected more, perhaps, of the con- cert as a whole, yet it remained a remarkably interesting evening with consistently fine orchestral playing and penetrating guidance from the immensely gifted com- poser-conductor.",

   "text_content" : "With the opening performance of Barber's Antony and Cleo- patra out of the way (and care- fully noted down, we trust, by William Seoltsam for entry in his Metropolitan Opera Annals), the company is bending its efforts in other directions (for example, La Gloconda and exactly how the new plant works). And the rest of us have a breathing spell in which to mull over the new Met's first effort. Simply because It was a first effort, there is a temptation to view it symbolically, to let it stand for the company and its new house. It doesn't of course, though It reflects them with some accuracy. It represents the latest work of individual artists, labour. ng under heavy pressure. First among these artists are the composer, Samuel Barber, and his librettist/designer/producer Franco Zefflrell. Since Mr, Zefirelli has provided both the starting point and the finishing touches for Mr. Barber, It is convenient to con- sider his contributions first, Almost everyone hereabouts seems to have admired his adaptation of the play, but it strikes me as a poor one and especially ill. considered In the light of his composer's demonstrated gifts and limitations. Zetilrelll has apparently choked on good Inton. tlons-he wanted to retain as much of Shakespeare's poetry as possible, and he wanted to retain some of the play's oplc scope and speed, He has done so. But these are the least Important of the play's chief attributest verbally, it is one of Shnkespeare's most prosaic works (In the literal sense) and epic scope and speed are Just what is almost Impossible to make persuasive In musio,.

The role of Cleopatra is written well to take advantage of Miss Price's shimmer and control in the upper register, and there is a colour surrounding her and her attendants that Is at least recognisable and characteristic. But nearly all the music concerning affairs of state, battles, and what not (the bulk of the first two acts) Is lacking in any proflle or flavour-It is incidental In the worst sense.

Miss Price seems never to have mastered the distinction between the sort of \" chest \" sound used In some kinds of pop or folk singing and that used In opera, and her efforts at parlando effects and recitative in this area were crude to the point of grotesquerie. Mr. Diaz has a firm, vigorous dramatic baritone voice, and a basically sound technique.

   "text_content" : "We have ll a lsone time had the experience of laughing in the course of a conversation at what seems to be some particu- larly happy piece of fantastica- tion, sonle subtle stroke of irony or some brilliant sick, joke, only to learn from the expression of shock, surprise or annoyance on the face of our interlocutor that he has, in fact, been in earnest all the time. Something akin to this has happened in the relationship between Marjorie (Marje) Proops and myself. Every Tuesday I have watched Ask Proops (Southern ITV). astounded that this talented comedienne-a cross between a younger Hermione Baddeley and an older Roy Hudd-should not have a greater following. Why is she never the guest of Billy Cotton? Why is she never the star of Sunday Night at the Palladium? The World of Proops-as I like to think of it-is the world of Nathaniel West's Miss Lonely- hearts and of William Trevor's Lady Dolores Bourhardie. What more brilliant device could be found to satirise, week after week, the pretensions, snobberies, timi- dities and tribal customs of the British than to take off the advice column of a newspaper? There sits Marje at her huge executive desk, with an attractively demure, blonde secretary at her elbow. Marie draws on her long cigarette holder, rattles the lucky charms on her bony wrist and shuffles some papers, as she asks: \"Well, what's the first one to-da'y, dear?\" The secretary begins to read. Marje is pragmatic, sensible and brisk. A widow writes to ask if she can wear white at her second wedding. White, Marje reminds her, is symbolic of virginity and you can't be a virgin twice, now can you? Better to try rose or pale blue - or was it lavender? Not that Marie is lacking in sympathy. \"Poor love,\" \"Yes, I do see the problem,\" and \"Try and carry on\" are phrases often on her lips. \" Watch it,\" however, is her excellent advice to the couple who wonder if it is wise to spend their holidays apart-\"That,\" she adds, \"is how things begin.\" \"Yes,\" she sighs to another female correspondent, who wishes to have her hair short but whose husband wishes her to have it long. \" Men do like to see hair on the pillow.\" Equally brilliant performances come from the experts Marje summons for advice: a clergyman who explains that the best form of address to his kind is not \"Rev.\" or even \" Reverend \" but \" Vicar \" -after all, if the clergyman is in fact only a curate. no offence will be taken; or a splendid caricature of a knowing man-about-town who demonstrates what type of glass should be used for what type of drink; or a Molly Dumont figure who remonstrates with the parting guest not to make his bed on the morning that he leaves-by doing so. he might give his hostess the impression that he assumed that she would use the same sheets again. Such for me was the risible World of Proops: one to cherish beside the World . of Frankis Howerd or the World of Tony Hancock. But then came the shock. At a loss on the railway train for something to read, I pc e up e a ere wom s Anna Massey and Ronald Hines paper lying on the seat beside me, opened it at the advice column and discovered that Marjorie (Marje) Proops actually exists. At any moment now I expect to make the same kind of unpalatable dis- covery about some other folk- heroine of mine. Ena Sharpies, Modesty Blaise, Auntie Maine- where will it end? The basic situation of John Hale's Armchair Theatre play. Light the Blue Touch Paper (ABC Saturday) was so absurd that it all but nullified some adroit dialogue and characterisation and a splendid performance from Anna Massey in the chief part. Miss Massey plays one of those women, at once admir- able and tiresome, who decide to give away their htuhands' second- best, suits to Oxfam and insist on the installation of a telephone they can ill afford not in order to natter with their friends but so that they can become Telephone Samaritans. A boy-friend whom she has not seen for more than four years suddenly calls her up to ask if she is willing to give him a character reference for a job. In the past she and he had acted as Spies for Peace and taken part in CND marches. A form, the boy-friend says, will reach her soon. But it is not a form but a security man that she eventually finds on her door- mat. From him she learns that the boy-friend has applied for the post of research scientist in a depart- ment of the Ministry of Defence concerned with chemical warfare. Naturally, given her views, she is appalled; and since the boy-friend once appeared to share those views wholeheartedly, she at once assumes that he can only be trying to enter the department for reasons of espionage. From this point the play becomes convincing. But it is surely either recklessly careless or childishly ingenuous of Mr. Hale to build on such shaky founda- tions. No one who is about to undergo a severe security check is asked to nominate those with whom the checking is to be made; and if so asked, would any man nominate a former girl-friend, a CND supporter, rather than a friend of his family or a former headmaster or teacher ? Having nominated the girl-friend, would he not go to the trouble of squaring her-saying, in effect: \" For God's sake don't let on that I once held those far-out views \" ? Nonetheless, in spite of this radical flaw, the play was- an ex- citing one; and Miss Massey, giving a performance that recalled the young Celia Johnson in its com- bination of wan wistfulness and staunch moral integrity, showed yet again what a superb actress she can be. Twenty-four Hours on Friday provided some minutes of gripping if muted drama when Cliff Michel- more interviewed Gerda Mun- singer on the occasion of the pub- lication of the Spence Report. Mr. Michelmore was courteous but remorseless: the report had stigmatised Mrs. Munsinger as a prostitute and a spy-what had she to say to that? Mrs. Mun- singer denied all accusations with outward composure. But a tightness around the mouth, a tremor of the voice or a nervous gesture would from time to time betray that here was a woman under an appalling mental strain: In its quiet implacability the in- quisition was not unlike the grill- ing of Miss Massey by the security man in Mr. Hale's play. But this Marjorie Proops was real life, transcending-as it does from time to time on television -all but the highest kind of art, and the result was something at once atrocious, moving and oddly cathartic.

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN The decision by the Ascot authority to -concentrate on con- ditions events rather than on handi- caps at their first autumn meeting it to be commended, and last Thursday, Friday and Saturday provided not only high-class, com- petitive apaort, but also much food for thought By far the most significant race of the three days, to my way of thinking, was the Royal Lodge Stakes for two-year-olds run over the Old Mile on Friday. Indeed, at the risk of being confounded by events, I am inclined to stick out my neck and suggest that the winner, Mr. H. J. Joel's Royal Palace, assuming that he suffers no physical setback during the intervening months, is the probable winner of next year's Derby. Royal Palace, a commending bay colt by the 1957 St. Leger winner, Ballymoss, out of Crystal Palace, a mare who traces back on the dam's side to Picture Play, who won the 1,000 Guineas in 1944, and, through her, to the great mare, Absurdity, is certainly well enough bred for the task. And anyone who watched Friday's race will no doubt concede that he was by no means fortunate in 'running. The facts are that Royal Palace was caught flat-footed at the start, thereby losing approximately ten lengths, was called on to make up most of the deficit in a sustained burst rounding the bend into the straight, and was then driven straight into the lead without being granted even a momentary breather. It would have occasioned no surprise had Mr. Joel's colt compounded at, or soon after, this stage of the proceedings, but' though he did veer sharply to the right under pressure and, as a result came near to losing the race at the subsequent Stewards' in- quiry, he was straightened out by Piggott and ran on gamely to win by 1% lengths from Slip Stitch, with Starry Halo. three lengths farther behind, third. On Saturday there was a tremendous race for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes for three-year- olds and upwards, also run over the Old Mile. After the three- year-old Tesco Boy had taken the small field along at what appeared to be a good gallop, the favourite, Silly Season, moved up to him smoothly on the bit about a fur- long from the finish, with Piggott poised to challenge on Hill Rise on the outside. From then onwards it was an almost exact replica of the Rous Memorial Stakes at the Royal meeting, for as Silly Season hit the front, Hill Rise quickened to go with him, and, in the last 30 yards, forged ahead to win by a neck. For the benefit of those who have criticised G. Lewis's handling of Silly Season on more than one occasion, it is relevant to point out that not only was the Rous Memorial Stakes as between Hill Rise and Silly Season confirmed accurately, but that Silly Season defeated Tesco Boy by precisely the same margin, and on almost identical terms, as in the Suusex Stakes at Goodwood. As for Hill Rise, this tough American-bred horse will accom- pany his stable-companion. Aunt Edith, to Paris for the Prix de 1'Arc de Triomphe run on Sunday week and is likely to prove a worthy second string. They will not be the only English challengers for I understand that, following his victory in the Red Deer Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, Mr. L. Freedman's four-year-old Sayalirao colt, I Say, will definitely be in- cluded among the runners at Longchamp. Whether I Say, who, it will be remembered, finished third to Sea Bird I and. Meadow Court in the 1965 Derby, and who this year won the Coronation Cup at Epsom before running third to Prominer and Rehearsed for the Hardwicke Stakes at. Ascot, is quite up to the standard required is a matter of opinion. Personally, I doubt it, for apart from this con- sideration, I Say is a pronounced front-runner, and very few horses -if any-have contrived to set '' off in front and remain there to the end in this great race. An event of more or less im- mediate significance at last week's Ascot meeting was the Gordon Carter Handicap run over two miles on the Thursday, inasmuch as it provided a useful dress- (r rehearsal for next Saturday's Cesarewitch. In this race last year5 Sayfar, a grey colt by Saya- firao, the sire of I Say, finished second here with 8 st 10 lbs, and, nine days later, carried 7 st 13 lbs into third place in the Newmarket marathon, a neck and a short head behind Mintmaster and Aureate, having been involved in some scrimmaging in the Dip, but for which he would almost certainly have won. On Thursday last, Sayfar, carrying 9 st 6 lbs and conceding from 9 lbs to 33 Ibs to his 12 opponents, won the Gordon Carter Handicap by-a conservative six lengths, and it is hard to see who is likely to beat H. Leader's colt on Saturday. Indeed, the current odds of 5 to I offered by leading bookmakers against his winning would .appear to be remarkably generous. However, it may be as well to remember that bookmakers are not in the habit of dispensing gratuitous benefits, and that their apparent generosity on this occasion is no doubt in- fluenced by the fact that Sayfar walked away feelingly after the Ascot .race apd that a veterinary H surgeon was called in in order to examine a swelling in one of the colt's forelegs. It has since been reported that the matter is of no consequence-it is thought that Sayfar may have rapped himself -but one has learnt by experience to respect the bookmakers' intelli- gence service, and this being the case, it is probably sound tactics to wait until Sayfar is delivered safe and sound in the paddock at Newmarket before making a sub- stantial bet, even if the delay in- A volves accepting half the odds currently available.
