   "text_content" : "By Le*la BouMon and John Lloyd in Moscow A NEW power structure in the Soviet Union giving political supremacy to the republics was presented yesterday as a fit accompli to the Congr-ess of People's Deputies, the coun- try's supreme lawmakng body Deputies agreed to discusa the proposals, which would render the Congress impotent, over the next two days. The formula, ending more than 70 years of centralised control from Moscow, envis- ages the setting up of a \"fee common economic space\" with accelerated radical reforms and the preservation of united armed forces. All international agree- menta, including those involv ing arms cuts, would be observed. The plan offers each republic the possibility of concluding a union treaty in which it would \"independently determine the form of its participation\". The proposals were put to the deputies by Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kaz akhstan, after agreement on Sunday and the early hours of yesterday between Mr Gorba- chev and the leaders of 1C republics. Under the proposed struc- ture, new bodies of central authority would be set up to operate until a new constltu- THE SOVIET UNION * Major draw hope from Moscow sapsahol Republics agree 'sticking plater' pact, Page 2 SUS to establish diplomatic ties with Baltic republics, Page 18 tion is adopted and elections for more permanent institu- tions are held. The choice of Mr Nazarbayev rather than Mr Gorbachev to make the announcement underlined the dominant posi- tion of the republics over the remnants of the old Soviet structures - discredited by passivity or acquiescence in the failed putsch. \"We have now entered the period of transition from a totalitarian state to a real con- federation,\" said Mr Georgy Shakhnazarov, political adviser to the Soviet president. Seated next to Mr Boris Yelt- sin, the Russian leader, in the front row of the Congress, Mr Gorbachev listened impas- sively to the proposals. The Soviet president later presided over part of the afternoon ses- sion, but made no speech. Designed to \"prevent further collapse of structures of power\", the statement proposes three bodies to run inter-repub- lic affairs: * A State Council including the Soviet president and the republic leaders to \"co-ordinate foreign and domestic issues\". This is likely to be the main body of power. * A Council of Representa- tives of People's Deputies, with 20 deputies from each republic. This would appear to take the place of the Congress of Peo- ple's Deputies, although the extent of its powers is not clear. * An interim Inter-Republican Economic Committee \"to co-or- dinate management of the economy me conauct or econoicc reform\". The statement appeals to all republics, whether or not they have declared epedce, to sign an agreement tely \"to secure normal functioning of the economy\". Last night Mr Arkady Vol- sky, deputy chairman of the Committee for the Manage- ment of the Economy which is carrying on the functions of the Soviet government, added his voice to the urgent calls for such an agreement. \"Common problems can only be resolved jointly. If the republics start running away, Continued on Page 18 Soviet Continued from Page 1 the ruptured economic ties will result in colossal damage - worth billions of roubles,\" he said. The statement urging the republics to agree a common stance on defence and a \"mili- tary strategic space\" is a mea- sure aimed to prevent the set- ting up of separate armies being discussed by several republics. The final clause, however, calls on the Congress to sup- port applications from all republics to the United Nations for separate recognition - a move which would give them quasi-national status. Two Soviet republics - Ukraine and Belorussia - have tradi- tionally had representation at the UN, though without, until recently, any possibility of their taking a line independent of the Soviet one. On resumption, it soon became clear from the speeches of their representa- tives that the majority of each national group would support the proposal as a basis - but with strong reservations on the future shape of the union. Only one deputy, Mr Alexan- der Obolensky, called for the sacking of Mr Gorbachev as Soviet president - a post he has occupied for three years this month. Mr Obolensky, to mild applause but no effective support, said power was being \"usurped\" from the Supreme Soviet.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor, in Beijing CHINA yesterday sought to present the visit of Mr John Major as evidence that the regime's diplomatic isolation had come to an end. Beijing was also keen to play down the relevance to China of the rapid disintegration of communist rule in the Soviet Union. Premier Li Peng, one of the principal architects of the vio- lent end to student protests in Tiananmen Square two years ago, told Mr Major that the col- lapse of communism in the west would make no difference to political control in China. His comments, at a welcom- ing ceremony at the edge of the square in which the army crushed an emerging pro-de- mocracy movement, came as Mr Major defended his decision to visit Beijing against criti- cism in Hong Kong and Britain. Mr Major, who was due this morning to sign an agreement with Li to allow the construc- tion of a $16.2bn (29.6bn) air- port in Hong Kong before its reversion to China in 1997, rejected suggestions that he was offering succour to a tyrannical communist regime. He said the airport deal was essential to preserve stability and confidence in the run-up to Hong Kong's transfer to China. \"I have to live in the real world.\" he said. \"It would not Hong Kong seeks to en- hpseo...........................Page 4 ietodil Comment......Page 16 be proper to sit back and strike, an attitude and let Hong Kong pay the price.\" China insisted that construc- tion of the airport could go anead only if he agreed to be the first western leader to visit Beijing. The Japanese prime minister, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, is the only other leader of a sig- nificant democratic country to have visited Beijing since 1989. Mr Major promised to raise directly with the Chinese pre- mier his abhorrence of the human rights abuses in the wake of the Tiananmen crack- down. He is expected to men- tion a number of individual cases in which students and workers have been imprisoned without trial, as well as Bei- jing's long-standing record or repression in Tibet Mr Major, who will meet most of the Chinese leadership but not the reclusive Deng Xiaoping, is also using the talks to persuade them not to block western plans to increase greatly the authority of the United Nations. With the Beijing regime determined to persuade its own population that it has regained international respectability, Mr Welcome guest: John Major turns to talk to an aide during a meeting with Chinese premier II Peng in Belling's Great Hall of the People on the first day of his visit Major was faced with a wel coming ceremony including a march-past of Chinese troope through Tiananmen Square and a 19-gun salute. He referred obliquely during the ceremony to Britain's view that China could not be immune indefinitely to change elsewhere, by commenting on the rapid pace of events in Moscow. Earlier Mr Major had told the British press: \"China has had a period of isolation. It needs people going and telling them face to face what the world thinks.\" The People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, paid tribute to Mr Major in a front-page profile. The paper also carried a front-page editorial calling for continued economic reform. However, it warned against bourgeois liberalisation and the threat to socialism posed by a \"peaceful evolution\" to capitalism. China would never adopt a multi-party system, it said. * The approach of Mr Major, who will tomorrow travel to Hong Kong, will not win uni- versal approval in the British colony, Angus Foster adds from Hong Kong. Mr Martin Lee, leader of its largest political grouping, attacked the airport agreement as a \"breach of the 1984 Joint Declaration\" which prepared the way for Hong Kong's return to China in 1997."

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correspondent IBM, the US computer group, yesterday won the largest Brit- ish defence contract yet placed with an overseas company with a successful bid to man- age production of new helicop- ters for the Royal Navy. The deal, worth Â£1.5bn, is linked to a provisional first production order for 44 Merlin EH101 helicopters. The US company launched its bid in association with Westland, the Yeovil-based helicopter manufacturer, which has developed the Mer- lin airframe with Agusta of Italy. IBM's share of the work which covers the helicopter itself, its electronics and weap- ons systems and in-service sup- port, is expected to be less than 2 per cent. In spite of IBM's management role, all the hard- ware for the helicopter is due to be produced in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. The decision, announced yes- terday by Mr Tom King, defence secretary, is a setback to the UK's two biggest defence contractors, GEC and British Aerospace (BAe), which had submitted a joint bid for the Continued on Page 18 Technology, Page 14 Lax, Page 18 New IBM computer, Page 22 London stocks, Page 36 Helicopter Ctinusd from Pue 1 contract. IBM won the competition in spite of a last-minute offer by GEC and BAe to reduce their price for the order. The offer, made to government ministers last week by Lord Weinstock, the GEC managing director is understood to have still been higher than IBM's bid. Speaking on board the air- ft carrier Ark Royal during an arms exhibition in Ports- mouth, Mr King said BM had naIred \"a slightly lower cst quotation and better value for money\". The new contract is in addi tion to urn.m spent already by the UK on developing the EM101 which the Navy need* mainly for anti-submarine As the pgreamme stands each the Navys 44 E1r11's ill have cost 2511, or maP than 2% times the price of a Toredio Jet bomber. \"It O- ieesIve,\" Mr MUI a idmiUt -esry.

   "text_content" : "By John Uoyd and Leyl* Boulton in Moscow THE Soviet Union is no longer anything but the sum of its republi- can parts and power at union level does not exist separately from the combined will of the republics. This is the central thrust of yesterday's pro- posals for bodies to run the USSR. The statement in the name of the Soviet President and of 10 union republics, read by President Nursul- tan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the Congress of People's Deputies, reflects just this. There are to be three bodies of \"central\" power. The Council of Representatives of People's Deputiesiwill be drawn from the republics, with 20 deputies from each but with no union deputies. It appears to replace the Congress of People's Deputies. There will be a State Council, com- posed of the Soviet and republican presidents. There will also be an interim Inter- republican Economic Committee which will be made up of representa- tives of the republics, presumably eco- nomic/finance ministers or prime ministers. These three bodies will handle all matters of concern, both domestic and foreign, to the participating republics. The body of power is likely to be the State Council, since it will com- prise the republics' leaders. It is not clear how often the Council of Representatives will meet, who will preside over it, what its powers will be and whether or not it can pass legislation. However, its suggested form, of 20 deputies from each republic, is already arousing anger among Rus- sians who want the size of their republic recognised in voting struc- ture. Mr Yuri Luchinsky, a deputy from the Russian parliament watching the session, remarked bitterly that Russia would have only 20 representatives against \"80 from four corrupt Central Asian states\". On the other hand, all assented to the clause of the declaration which commits the republics to seek an eco- nomic agreement. It is now clear that the republican leaders have fully understood that the fragility of their economies cannot withstand a further severance of links between them. Mr Sergei Alexeyev, chairman of the Constitutional Compliance Com- mittee, said the new structures were necessary because \"the Union is not ust on the brink of collapse, it is in a state of collapse\". It is this feeling of panic before the crumbling of the economy, and the presqure of their electors to salvage something, which has helped push the deputies to embrace their own effective demise. The republics can see no other way of weathering the coming economic storm except by sticking' together. Mr Egor Gaidar, head of the pro- market Institute for Economic Policy, said in an interview that \"this is a temporary agreement, and if it is to be effective it is as a way of trying to ensure supplies in the winter. It is a matter of emergency. It doesn't say anything much about the future of the economic system.\" Thus, beyond a common will to pre- serve something of a national econ- omy, the scope of the agreement is doubtful. Mr Yuri Shcherbak, the Ukrainian environment minister, made it clear to the congress that Ukraine would support an economic agreement but did not want any part in creating a constitution \"becau we will all have -costitutions of our own and we don't need a Union one\". Armenia is taking the same rse tion, and may be followed by ths republics that have declared indepen- In consequence, there may be few takers for the first article of the decla- ration, that all republics which wish to will \"work out and sign a Treaty cf the Union of Sovereign States\", even though it is qualified by a clause which says that \"each of them will independently determine the form of its particpation in the Union\". In nearly all republics, anything smacking of the Union has been dis- credited, the Communist party which was its guardian has disappeared as an organisation and the tide of nation- alism runs strong. Indeed, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, faces trouble from his Supreme Soviet for having signed the declaration at all. Mr Gaidar says: \"One shouldn't overstate the effect of this agreement. Other republics than the Baltics may print their own currency - like the Ukraine. This will have very serious consequences for monetary policy.\" Nor may it be effective in prevent. ing some republics from creating their own military forces - especially i they feel threatened by their neigh- bours, as some do. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have cause to fear each other, and the Ukrainian leadership has seriously mooted the idea of a national army. For these reasons, the article which commits the participating republics to sign an agreement on defence \"to pre- serve united armed forces and a mili- tary-strategic space\" may come under very heavy pressure. Finally, in asking the Congress to support applications from all repub- lics to become separate members of the United Nations, the way is opened to a host of conflicting foreign poli- cies. Armenia and Azerbaijan might make opposing claims on the UN for assistance against the other: and if the inter-republican borders become an issue, that too could end up in the lap of the UN. The declaration has put a plaster on the disintegrative process: it cannot cure it. Lobbying deputies: a woman outside the Kremlin yester- day raises her fist and chants anti-communist slogans",

   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington FOR more than a weeku President George Bush has kept the world guessing about when the US would extend full diplomatic recognition to the Baltic states. Mr Bush's declaration yester- day that the US is ready to open full relations with inde- pendent Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia amounts to an historic shift in US policy toward the Soviet Union, a shift which underlines the transfer of power away from the central authorities in Moscow to the individual republics. Mr Bush and his advisers welcome the dismantling of the old centralised Soviet Union; but they remain worried that the process could spiral out of control. By instinct, they remain committed to dealing with known quantities, notably President Mikhail Gorbachev, and wary of newcomers such as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Rus- sian president. On the Baltic issue, Mr Bush has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect Mr Gorba- chev's domestic political posi- tion. Recognising that an early US move establishing diplo- matic relations could undercut the Soviet president's efforts at a post-putsch comeback, the White House avoided any move which could be interpreted as undermining the central authorities in Moscow, encour- aging the break-up of the Soviet Union and thereby unleashing a flood of claims to diplomatic recognition by other republics. The delay was much appreci- ated by Mr Gorbachev who last week was struggling to ward off attacks during the tumultu- ous session of the Soviet parlia- ment. However, the US demanded a price: in the end, it would be Mr Gorbachev, not the US, who would explicitly recognise the Baltic states' right to secede from the Soviet Union and claim their indepen- dence. In another deft touch, Mr Bush informed President Vytautas Landsbergis about his plan last week. The Lithua- nian president, whose emo- tional claims to independence have featured regularly on US television over the past two years, suddenly declared that he was prepared to \"wait a few days\". The delay allowed Soviet \"Black Beret\" forces to leave Lithuania, thereby helping to ease US worries that the Baltic states would not be able to con trol their own territory. It also allowed Mr Gorbachev to make the final declaration on the Baltic states during an inter view with Cable News Network and the new head of Soviet television on Sunday. Of course, Mr Bush suffered some brickbats at home, with Democrats and \"the talking head industry\" (the president's latest pet-hate) all accusing him of being timid and tenta- tive. But Mr Bush pointed out playfully, if inaccurately, \"when history is written nobody is going to remember that we took 48 hours more than Iceland\" to recognise the Baltics. Once hailed as the tank-top hero of the new Russian revo- lution, Mr Bush's aides are pri- vately accusing Mr Yeltsin of being \"swashbuckling\", \"head- strong\", and \"a dema- gogue\" - a reprise of the criti- cism he faced during his disastrous visit to the US in 1989 where he found himself dismissed as a bottle-swigging maverick. Mr Brent Scowcroft, who as national security adviser has strong influence over Mr Bush's thinking, summed up the administration's doubts about Mr Yeltsin during a weekend television interview. First he drew a distinction between Mr Yeltsin beingr der- ocratically elected and demo- cratically inclined by tempera- ment; then he raised questions about the Russian president's rapid consolidation of power in the aftermath of the putsch. \"He's one of those unusual charismatic kinds of personali- ties that do have tremendous power and influence, and it's not clear to what end,\" said Mr Scowcroft. The White House position is that, after the coup failed, Mr Yeltsin needlessly antagonised individual republics by hinting that Russia might redraw bor- ders; less seriously, they point out he humiliated Mr Gorba- chev before the Soviet parlia- ment and that Mr Bush cannot abide this kind of public dis- play of disrespect. Mr Bush remains fearful of the unknown and worried about the break-up of the Soviet Union and its impact on the rest of Europe. Given the upheavals in the Soviet leader- ship, which have seen dozens of familiar (if not always friendly) faces disappear over the past two weeks, this is a natural response. But it is bound to disappoint Mr Yeltsin who is also leading the charge toward change in the Soviet Union. Unspoken tension: Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday at the Congress of People's",

Mr Ernest Obminsky, the Soviet Union's deputy foreign minister, is the head of an eight-strong team that will atted a board meeting of the European Bank for Recon- struction and Development. Mr Obminsky has been selected as the top member of the group, in spite of the recent moves by Russian leaders to take over the most powerful positions in for- mulatinga the country's economic policy. Reflectin thee actions, three other mem- bers of the group are senior figures fom the Russian republic - Mr Andrei ZVCreV, the Russian deputy minister for flnance Mr Valeri Telegin, chairman of the Rus- man Bank for Foreign Trade; and Mr Ivan Materov, an adviser to the republic's council of ministers. The USSR delegation - the other four members of which are relatively lowly officias from the aun s authorities - will provide the EBRD with details ofat vest- amet proects which seem appropriate to the country as it moves to a free market. But it appears unlikely that the bank will act immediately on any strategy towards the country. The bank will probably use today's meeting as a forum for a general discus- soi about economic assistance, and put off formulating its strategy over lending to the USSR until a later date. An omcial said yesterday that the bank would probably need more time to allow the ssue of the split of powe between the centre and the republic in the USSR to be clarified.",

   "text_content" : "TEXT of a joint statement by President Mikhail Gorbachev and leaders of 10 Soviet repub- lies read by Kazakhstan Presi- dent Nursultan Nazarbayev to the Congress of People's Depu- ties. Reuter translation. 6 I am entrusted by the president and top officials of 10 republics to read out this statement worked out yester day, during the, night and this morning. As a result of the coup on August 19-21 this year, the process of forming new union relations between the sover eign states broke down. This brought the country to the brink of catastrophe. The situation that emerged in the country after the putsch, if it runs out of con- trol, could bring unpredict- able consequences inside the country and in relations with foreign states. We state that the failure of the coup and victory of democratic forces have delivered a serious blow to reactionary forces and to everything that had been hin- dering the process of demo- cratic change. Thus an historic chance has been created to speed up reform and renovation of the country. In these conditions, legally elected leaders of the country - the president of the country, presidents and chairmen of the Supreme Soviets (parliaments) of the republics - agree on the fol- lowing measures for a transi- tional period until a new con- stitution is adopted and new organs of power are elected. These measures will pre- vent iarther collapse of struc- ures of power; , Ipen g Cre- ation of a new political itate system of relations between the republics and formation of new nter-republican union structures. 1. AU republics which wish to should work out and sign a Treaty of the Union of Sove- eign States in which each of them will independently determine the form of its par ticipation in the union. 2. Appeal to all republics, Irrespective of the status they have declared, with a pro- posal to immediately con- dude an economic agreement for co-operation within the framework of a ree common economic space to secure normal functioning of the economy, supply of the popu- lation and accelerated imple- mentation of radical eco- nomic reform. 3. Create, for the transi- tional period, a Council or R2presentatives of People's Deputies on the principle of equal representation from unilon republics - 20 peo- plie's deputies delegated by each republican Supreme Soviet to decide upon matters of general principle. Set up a State Council out of the Soviet president and top state officials of the repub- lics to co-ordinate foreign and internal issues, that con- cern common republican interests. To set up Interim Inter-Republican Economic Committee out of representa- tives of all the republics on parity basis to co-ordinate management of the economy and co-ordinated conduct of economic reform. The draft constitution when ready should be consid- ered and approved by repub- lican parliaments and finally approved at a congress of plenipotentiary representa- tives of union republics. Confirm preservation of the status of all elected peo- ple's deputies of the USSR during their elected term. In this connection we ask the Congress to suspend tem- porarily corresponding articles of the Soviet Consti- tution. 4. Sign an agreement on defence, on the principles of collective security to preserve united armed forces and mill- tary-strateglc space, to carry out radical military reforms In the armed forces, KGB, Interior Ministry and prose- cutor's office of the USSR, taking into account republi- can interests. 5. To confirm strict obser- vation of all international agreements and obligations of the Soviet Union, including the question of arms cuts and control as well as foreign economic obligations. 6. To adopt a declaration granting rights and freedoms of citizens irrespective of their nationality, place of res- idence, party membership or political views, as well as the rights of national minorities. 7. Ask the Congress of Peo- ple's Deputies of the USSR to support applications of the union republics to the United Nations to recognise them as subjects of international law and to consider their mem- bership in this organisation. In view of the emergency of the proposed measures dic- tated by the existing situa- tion, we appeal to the Con- gress to adopt urgent decisions on $ these proposals. I",

   "text_content" : "By Chrysta Freeland in Kiev MR LEONID Kravchuk, the wily leader of the Ukraine, may have finally miscalculated in what has hitherto been a masterful balancing act of sat- isfying nationalist demands in the republic while simulta- neously appeasing Moscow. The nationalist opposition responded with fury yesterday to news that Mr Kravchuk had joined other republic leaders in agreeing to take part in talks on some form of new union treaty. Mr Ivan Drach, head of the pro-independence mass move- ment Rukh, said that Mr Krav- chuk had no authority to sign the statement and objected particularly to the implication that all-union government structures and armed forces might be preserved. Rukh is part of the parliamentary oppo- sition coalition, the Narodna Rada, which has been growing in strength since the failed coup as MPs defect from the communist bloc - which pre- viously commanded a maJority. Four supporters of Georgia's opposition National Democratic party were shot and wounded yesterday by speclal police breaking up an opposition rally in Tbillisi, Reuter reports from Moscow. In opposier tion callethe nationalist opposition called yesterday for a general strike to begin today in support of demands for democratic reform. Meanwhile, Nagorno- Karabakh, the Armenian enclave of Azerbaian, declared itself independent of the Soviet republic. If the Narodna Rada finds itself in control of parliament today it may push for Mr Kravchuk's resignation as chairman, according to Mr Levko Luki- anenko, the head of the modest moposition party. The opposition was only par- tially mollified by Mr Krav* chuk's speech at the extraordi- nary session of the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow, when he spoke of maintaining economic and military ties with other republics but said that in the political sphere no al-union structure could have authority over the Ukrainian sprliament. Opposition deputies pre- ferred the performance of Mr Yuri Shcherbak, the Ukrainian environment minister. The only cabinet minister who w=as not a member of the Commu nist party before the putsch, Mr Shcherbak strongly opposed umbrella political structures such as an all-union constitution. When Mr Kravchuk addresses the Ukrainian parlia ment today at the opening of ts autumn session, he is likely to claim that he signs nothing more than a statement of intent which makes no con- cree promises. The argument may win him a brief reprive.",

   "text_content" : "By Leyla Boulton in Moscow THE BLOW was brutal and swift. In the space of five min- utes, the Soviet Union's supreme legislature was made an offer it could hardly refuse. It all started at 10 am when Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, opened the session of the Con- gress of People's Deputies by announcing that President Mikhail Gorbachev and 10 republican leaders had worked out a plan to save the union. Necessitated by the changes in the country since the abor- tive coup d'etat two weeks ear- lier, it even provided for a new parliament. Would the deputies please go away, discuss the proposals, come back, put them on the agenda, and approve them? The session would resume at 2pm. Although the choice of Mr Nazarbayev as axe-man added to the surprise of the blow, deputies were quick to blame the leader who three years ago gave the Soviet Union the clos- est thing it had ever had to a democratically elected parlia- ment: Mikhail Gorbachev. \"Gorbachev has signed his own death-sentence. He will become an obedient instru- ment in the hands of the republics. This shows a full lack of respect for the Con- gress,\" exclaimed one furious deputy, Mr Nikolai Koryugin. Deputies were told they could retain their status and, for members of the Supreme Soviet, their pay until their mandates expire in 1994. Mr Grigory Revenko, a top aide to President Gorbachev, said deputies had no choice but to approve the proposals unless they could coIne up with a better way to stop the country collapsing. Whether they were being realistic, or were simply stunned, deputies returned from their break to approve the agenda. \"This is probably [sui- cide] ... but there's no time left,\" said Colonel Valery Ochi- rov, the conservative deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's defence committee. Mr Viktor Shtepo, an elderly reformer from Volgograd, was still not sure this meant the end, but he shared the feeling that emergency was in the air. \"All voted yes because the sit- uation in the country requires extreme measures to save the state and the people.\" Radical supporters of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian pres- ident, and deputies from the independence-minded republics were delighted. \"This is not suicide. They're simply going for a long holiday - ending in retirement,\" said Mr Vladimir Lukin from the Russian Parlia- ment.",

   "text_content" : "W4ibert Mauither on doubts about Mitterrand ST9 HE FAIIÃ½ED Soviet putsch has come as ar. unexpected bonus to the French, accustomed as they are to spend their long summer holiday reading about aphrc- disiacs and ways of obtainining deep tans without, at the same time, contracting skin cancer. This year a dramatic foreign crisis has provided the media with the opportunity of manu- facturing a domestic one in its wake. At issue is the vaunted polit- ical judgment - or lack of it - of President Francois Mitter rand. Never famed for calling a spade a spade, \"the prince of ambiguity,\" as one opposition deputy called him, excelled himself by the non-committal manner in which he reacted initially to the attempted Soviet putsch, provoking unfa- vourable comparisons with the rapid condemnation of the coup leaders by President George Bush and Mr John Major. To be sure, Mr Mitterrand could hardly be accused of approving the coup. But the fact that, in a television appearance on the first day, he referred to \"the new Soviet leaders\" and even read out a letter from their head, Mr Gen- nady Yanayev, was universally interpreted as an indication that the president was pre- pared to accept what, at first, looked like a fait accompli. That ambiguous position was later rectified. The rein- statement of Mr Mikhail Gorb- achev was warmly welcomed and the courage of Mr Boris Yeltsin suitably lauded. But the damage had been done. None of the protestations by Mr Mitterrand and his apolo- gists that the president's first duty was to look after the long-term interests of his coun- try and to refrain from hasty and emotional reactions to big international crises, succeeded in convincing his many critics. They were the explanations that one would expect foreign ministries to make in such cir- cumstances. But the general view in France was that pur- ported \"reasons of state\" should not have been allowed by Mr Mitterrand to overrule the political obligation to con- demn quickly and vigorously an unconstitutional act which reversed all the democratic gains made under Mr Gorba- chev, as well as risking a resumption of the cold war. From there it was no more than a small step to proclaim, as many have done, that the \"old fox\" had lost his touch, that, at nearly 75, his capaci- ties were failing and that it was time for him to go. In real- ity, the Soviet coup is certainly not the first time that his judg- ment has proved defective. That view has been gaining ground ever since the Berlin wall came down nearly two years ago, though it has been partially offset recently by what the French, at least, con- sider to have been the presi- dent's \"good Gulf war\". A newspaper cartoon last week, picturing a solitary Mr Mitter- rand standing on a quayside while an ocean liner named \"History\" is fast departing towards the distant horizon, sums up the growing percep- tion that he has lately been one step behind the radical political developments which have transformed the interna- tional scene. The main criticism levelled at him is that, in spite of the popular upheavals in Europe and the Soviet Union, which have swept away all -the received ideas about a con- trolled balance of power between nations, he has con- tinued to believe in the old order. Hence, the telling com- parison made by Le Moride newspaper between the French president and the famous 19th century Austro-Hungarian statesman Metternich, the main architect of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. To be fair, Mr Mitterrand has not been the only statesman to make such misjudgments. Mrs Margaret Thatcher shared his deep scepticism about German unification and the belief that the Soviet Union would not consent to such a step for at least 10 years. Other western leaders have been as reluctant as the French president to con- template the break-up of the Yugoslav federation into inde- pendent states. Nor has Mr Mitterrand been alone in his belief that an early expansion of the membership of the Euro- pean Community to include, the new democracies of eastern Europe could put a brake on political and monetary union. That, however, is of less interest to the French than the fact that their own leader, always proud of his historical insight and political sensitiv- ity, should have shown so little understanding and imagina- tion in his appreciation of recent international develop- ments. Mr Mitterrand's stand- ing has been further eroded by what is widely perceived to be the injudicious recent appoint- ment of the outspoken Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minis- ter. Her undiplomatic criti- cisms of Japan have merely confirmed the impression that France's foreign policy is seri- ously adrift. Given that Mr Mitterrand is a socialist, though theoreti- cally no longer tied to the socialist party in his position as president, his diminished prestige clearly has implica- tions for the next general elec- tion in 1993, not to speak of the next presidential election, due in 1995. Already suffering from a serious loss of popularity as the result of the downturn in the country's economic situa- tion and, particularly, the sharp rise in unemployment, the socialists' chances of con- serving even their present very slim majority do not now look very good. The expected resumption of economic activ- ity towards the end of this year could change things, but there is much to do to counteract the widespread feeling that 12 years in power, even if briefly interrupted by a spell of, \"cohabitation\" with conserva- tive political partes, is enough. Moreover, te socialists are currently faced with an 80agon-, ing choice: WIhether to forge Ianother electoral alliance with a discredited communist party, once a power in the land, now reduced to no more than 6-7 per cent, electoral support. Though, on paper, the-social- ists are likely to need commu- nist support, any revival of the old alliance on its old terms could prove to be the kiss of death, given the demise of international communism. Meanwhile, President Mitter- rand's own position is legally impregnable, though he might think twice about soldiering on to the end of his second term if the right and centre parties win the parliamentary elec- tions. He once promised that he would reduce the presiden- tial term from its present seven years to five, and rumour has it that he is once again contemplating calling a referendum on such a pro- posal. The big question is whether such a reduction would apply Only to the next president or whether Mr Mit- terrand wants to give himself the chance of bowing out gracefully two years early."

   "text_content" : "By William Dawklna in Paris DIVISIONS in the French Communist Party (PCS) have widened with a plea for \"urgent\" reforms by nearly a third of its MPs. The reformers' group, including eight national MPs, have issued a paper condemn- ing a \"serious democratic dell- cit\" in the party following the failed Soviet coup. This is the most open example to date of the growing rift between tradi- tionalists and reformers in the party which lay behind its ambignous response to last month's upheavals In Moscow. Any sign of ideological change in the communist party, traditionally loyal to a alistyle creed, is signii- cant to France's minority socialist government, which relies on the comamunists for a majority in parliament The government's electoral for- tunes are linked to the com- munists', though socialists are divided between divorce and seeking a wider marriage with a reformed PCS. \"The situation created by the putsch and its failre calls French communists to renew our analysis of Soviet experi- ence, of international commu- nism and of the functioning of the PCF,\" say the NPs. Their appeal comes as the central committee starts a meeting today at which the party's political leaders will air their ideological differ- eances. So far, the PCS has appeared to make noas ast- ment to its allicial ideology in light of the upheavals in east- era uo a staee which has ctr d to the decline in its domeie ppularity.",

However; it may also signal a shift in tac- tds by Mir Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president and one of the princpal protagonists The agreement calls for hos- tilities to stop imnibdiately, demobilisation of Croatia's National Guard, withdrawal of the Yugoslav army to barracks in Croatia, and EC superviidon of the ceasefire. At the ceremonial signing in the early boui s of yestera morni Mr Milosevic reluc tantlya spied to a toast only When forced by Mr va den Brok, Dutch foreign minister. The Serbian leader signed the agreeitent only after repiated threats of ecohomic sanctions. But he may be bank- ing on international arbiters granting his republic 'the largely Serbian populated terri- tories in- Croatia,. where Ser militants have takn contrio. The Croatian government, however, is unlikely to accept any redrawing of its borders. Mr Milosevic said the docu- meit was only acceptable because leaders of the Serbian minority would be included in the talks. But militants in the self-proclaimed autonomous regions who are staging the uprising sent a letter yesterday to the EC denouncing the agreement because it excludes their representatives from the Mr Franjo Tudjian, the Cro- atian president, said yesterday: \"We are especially satisfied because the same side which forced us int6 war has been obliged to accept peace and an EC control over that peace\". But he warned that \"securing the ceasefire represented the hardest part of the job.\" Mr van den Broek said the EC would send observers to Croatia \"as soon as the cease- fire comes into effect\". Scattered fighting yesterday in sevetal towns in the region of Bapja, in' central Croatia, suggested that a lasting cease- fire had not yet been achieved. The Bonn government called in Yugoslavia's ambassador last night to voice its concern about the continued fighting. Renter adds: The European Commission president, Mr Jac- ques Delors, regretted on French television yesterday the EC's failure to send an intervention force to stop the fighting. \"The Community is like an adolescent facing the crisis of adulthood,\" he said. \"If it were 10 years older, there would have been an inverven- tion force.\" In Brussels, more than 1,000 Croatian mothers with sons in the Yugoslav army demon- strated in front of EC head- quarters for their release from the fighting. They had made the long journey across Europe by bus to ask for the EC's help.",

   "text_content" : "By Quentin Peel in Bonn THE German government last night approved a plan to increase value added tax by one percentage point to 15 per cent from January 1, 1993, in the face of the persistent bud- get deficit caused by unifica- tion. It also agreed a simulta- neous increase in family and child-related tax allowances. Some government advisers had proposed raising VAT to 16 per cent, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, warned that this may yet be necessary if government spending cannot be curbed in the meantime. A meeting of the principal partners in the government coalition, the CDU and CSU, gave overwhelming approval to the tax proposals yesterday, but the opposition Social Dem- ocrats (SPD), who control a majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house, are committed to opposing the VAT increase. Thus, the issue seems certain to end up in a mediation com- mission of the two German parliamentary chambers, giv- ing the SPD an effective veto. Even within the ruling coali- tion, opposition to the govern- ment's proposed DMlObn (Â£3.4bn) in subsidy cuts is growing, with strong criticism voiced yesterday at cuts in shipbuilding subsidies. Instead, deputies want some re-exami- nation of existing tax breaks for house-building. Mr Bj6rn Engholm, the SPD leader, said yesterday his party would vote against the VAT increase in both houses of par- liament, although he would not commit himself to a position in the mediation commission. He called for rejection of tax cuts for the highest paid and for big corporations, for an end to tax allowances for domestic ser- vants, and for aviation fuel concessions to be scrapped, as ways of raising revenue. In the government budget to be presented by Mr Waigel in the Bundestag today, the cen- tral government's net borrow- ing requirement next year is supposed to be cut to less than DM50bn, although calculations within the Finance Ministry show the total PSBR will still top DM200bn, including all the subsidies going to the former East Germany. By 1995, the net borrowing requirement is sup- posed to be reduced below DM25bn. The proposed 1992 budget totals DM422.5bn, or some 3 per cent higher than in the current year.",

   "text_content" : "By Stephen Fdler THE Philippines has reached a rapid agreement with a group of its leading bank creditors on debt restructuring. The outline agreement, reached in New York after five days of talks between govern- ment officials and a 12-bank creditor committee led by Man- ufacturers Hanover, would allow creditors to exchange loans for concessional bonds or to make new loans to the gov- ernment. A debt buy-back for cash is also envisaged. Manila expects funding from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Japan and the US to help support the agreement. These funds will be used as collateral to back the concessional bonds and, if the funding is sufficient, to sup- port a buy-back of debt for cash. Philippine officials are hope- ful that a final agreement can be concluded with all bank creditors by the end of the year. Mr William Rhodes, vice- chairman of Citicorp, the US bank, described the deal as a good one which \"should allow the. Philippine government to put the debtcrisis behind it\". The Philippines completed a debt package, including a buy- back of $1.3bn (I770m) of its debt in January 1990. The lat- est agreement covers $5.3bn of medium- and long-term bank debt. The country's total for- eign debt is around $29bn. The government originally attempted to secure its financ- ing needs through a co-financ- ing loan arranged through the Asian Development Bank (ADB). But the negotiations proved difficult and the gov- ernment, with the backing of some bank creditors, Philip- pine legislators and others, eventuall decided to seek a .comprehensve debt restructur- ing package, in which the ADB co-financing remains a part. The US has pledged support for Manila's efforts to manage its foreign debt as part of Washington's attempt to. secure ratification of an agree- ment which would allow the US to keep its military base at Subic Bay. The Subic Bay agreement is facing tough opposition in the Philippines senate, where a two-thirs majority is required for ratification. The bank deal may be put in jeopardy if the Subic Bay agreement is not ratified. Bankers also say the Philip- pines may not be able to meet conditions required by the IMF, which would constitute another risk to the bank deal.

Hong Kong also hopes the signing of the agreement will lead to progress in the Sino- British joint liaison group (JLG), which is overseeing the details of Hong Kong's return to China and has been seri- ously held up since the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings. Hong Kong is keen to use the goodwill created by the air- port agreement to break through an impasse at the JLG. On matters such as the establishment of a court of final appeal in Hong Kong, to replace the Privy Council in London, there has been no significant progress for two years. Sir David is to meet Mr Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. The two sides will discuss the formation of a special commit- tee under the JLG. The com- mittee will be made up of senior diplomats and officials from the two sides and will also be able to draft in experts. Britain will use the commit- tee to consult China on all sub- stantial airport contracts, fran- chises and borrowings which straddle 1997. The committee is to be a channel for communica- tion and consultation and to avoid any further public rows, such as that which threatened the new airport project earlier this year. Sir David will also discuss the setting up of a consultative committee of 30 to 40 people. This will be made up of Hong Kong citizens and will be able to discuss the new airport proj- ect but will not have decision- making power.",

   "text_content" : "By Stefan Wagatyl in Tokyo JAPAN is considering establishing 10 free trade zones, to improve foreign access to its market amid mounting international con- cern over recent increases in the country's trade surplus. The plan is the main point of a package of import-boosting measures prepared by the Min- istry of International Trade and Industry. The ministry is seeking an 11-fold increase to YL65bn (Â£72m) in its annual budget for promoting foreign access. Miti will have to fight for the funds in competition with other ministries, but the scale of its bid indicates how seri- ously it regards the frictions caused by the recent expansion in the trade surplus.

Japan's cumulative current account surplus for the first seven months of 1991 was $33.97bn, (Â£20.2bn), a 94 per cent increase on last year.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Gawith in Johannesburg MR Nelson Miandela, the Africian National Congrese leader, will today urge South African President F W de Klerk to release three right-wing hunger strikers so that they can reveal alleged details of their involvement in state- sponsored violence. Mr Mandela, leader of the ANC, yesterday visited the three men, who belong to the Orde Boerevolk organisation, in a Pretoria hospital. The men have not eaten for between 42 and 56 days. He said after- wards: \"These men impress me as being very sincere and I am convinced that they have very valuable information to give about the role of the National Intelligence Service and Mili- tary Intelligence who had instructed them to commit some heinous offences.\" The hunger strikers have refused to start eating until they are granted indemnity from prosecution for offences they are alleged to have com- mitted. The Indemnity Com- mittee, appointed to advise the government, unanimously found that the offences did not fall within the guidelines for political offences and the cabi- net accepted their advice. The three are being charged with murder and attempted murder. They are alleged to have been involved in a bomb blast at a Pretoria taxi rank in which 13 people were iuurea, and in a parc-el-bomb attack which killed a man in Durban. Although Mr Mandela has said he is seeking the men's release on humanitarian grounds, some local observers believe he wishes to establish a precedent which will also allow ANC members who have com- mitted serious crimes to be indemnified. It is highly ironic that the ANC should be championing the.cause of an ultra right- wing organisation, one of whose spokesmen last week sought to justify the taxi blast by pointing to the large num- ber of road accidents caused by black-owned taxis.",

   "text_content" : "I Participants in the peace process are being urged to accentuate the positive, wntes Tony Walker M Eliahu Ben-Elissar, chair- man of the Israeli parlia- ment's foreign affairs and defence committee, fields a question by way of an old Jewish saying: \"Don't ask a rabbi for an answer you won't be pleased to get.\" As participants in the proposed Middle East peace process dance cau- tiously around the extremely sensi- tive issues involved, they are being urged to avoid for the moment the more obvious sticking points. The American term for this is \"con- structive ambiguity\". Thus the posi- tive elements are emphasised at the expense of the negative in the hope that the flimsy process can somehow be maintained. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, has accomplished more than most of his predecessors in his efforts to coax and cajole Israel and its Arab neighbours to at least contemplate sit- ting down together, but even this first step is by no means assured. The US official has been to the Mid- dle East on shuttle missions six times since the end of the Gulf war and is expected again this month, although Israel yesterday disavowed reports that his visit was on for next week. He still has quite a lot of work to do, not least in finding a formula to sat- isfy Palestinian fears about being a vulnerable and much-weakened iunior partner in any process. \"This is not a fishing expedition,\" says Ms Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian university professor who is among several Palestinians from the occu- pied territories who have been negoti- ating with Mr Baker. \"You cannot afford too many ambiguities or you will end up dealing with abstractions without substance,\" she says. Both the Israelis and Palestinians have set out their own \"red lines\" for participation in Mr Baker's October peace conference. Israel says no to any involvement of the Palestine Lib- eration Organisation, no to the partic- ipation of Palestinian representatives from East Jerusalem and most emphatically no to a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as the eventual aim of the process. Palestinians engaged in talks witn Mr Baker insist, on the other hand, on the PLO approving participants in the planned peace gathering. They insist on the status of Jerusalem being addressed and they are adamant that Israel's compliance with United Nations resolutions requiring its with- drawal from occupied Arab land, including east Jerusalem, be the con- ference centrepiece. On the face of it, these apparently mutually exclusive positions do not augur well for the convening of the conference with Palestinian participa- tion, let alone progress in negotia- tions. But Mr Baker has shown a cer- tain doggedness in his pursuit of an elusive opening to Middle East peace, and he may yet succeed where others have failed in at least persuading the parties to sit down together, although the issues are so complex and mis- trust so deep that ultimate success -ould be miraculous. T he US official can at least claim at this stage to have secured Israel's and Syria's conditional agreements to attend, along with Egypt and Jordan. The Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, would send an observer, which leaves the Palestinians still undecided. \"Constructive ambiguity\" is likely to become an overworked phrase in the days ahead as Mr Baker's Middle East team seeks a formula that would persuade the PLO to sanction the par ticipation of Palestinian representa- tives in the process on terms that would not attract an Israeli veto. The task will not prove easy. The Baker team has been negotia- ting with both the Israelis and Pales- tinians on memoranda of understand- ing or, as the Americans would prefer it, \"letters of definition\" - non-bind- ing documents that would basically seek to clarify US attitudes to the process ahead of the conference. The Israelis are pressing for a re- statement of US positions on exclu- ding the PLO, on rejection of a Pales- tinian state and on the relegation of the UN to the role of \"silent partner\" at the planned gathering. They are also seeking undertakings that the conference would not be empowered to act as an arbiter of disputes; that its role would be largely ceremonial leading to direct bilateral talks between Israel and its neighbours. The Palestinians want a clear re- statement of US support for Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 requiring Israeli withdrawal from ter- ritory seized in the 1967 war, which includes east Jerusalem. They are also pressing for a halt to settlements in the occupied territories. Ms Ash- rawi warned against a tendency in Palestinian ranks towards \"excessive pragmatism\". The Palestinians would not be part, she said, of a process that enabled Israel to continue \"creating facts\" on the ground, adding: \"We have no authority to sign away basic rights. These rights belong to future generations.\" While she recognised that Palestin- ians and the PLO had scarcely been in a weaker position, they still retained the right to say no. \"You cannot vio- late the principles or integrity of any negotiating process,\" she declared. \"There shouldn't be coercion or pres- sure on either side. You have to have certain legal terms of reference.\" Mr Ben-ElUssar would agree...up to a point. \"I'm not in favour of gim- micks,\" he says. \"Either you sit down with genuine intentions to try to secure some kind of agreement, or its just public relations.\" But the Israeli official made it clear that excluding the PLO, and therefore by definition Palestinians from outside the occu- pied territories, from any role remained an Israeli priority. \"In this land (West of the River Jordan),\" he declared, \"there is only one landlord.\"",

Millions of dollars' worth of Japanese electronics, French perfume, Scotch whisky and Swiss chocolates dazzle the long-starved Peruvian con- sumer. \"Sigio XX\" (20th Century) is a s7pper's paradise and sym- bol of the radical foreign trade reforms that have jolted tradi- tionally protectionist Peru into modern-day liberalisation. Peru is a4dusting to its biggest trade shake-up for decades. Since the Fuimori administra- tion took office last July, and since Mr Carlos Bolola, the regime's economy minister, got into his stride in March, liber- alising decrees have been pour- IM firth. rade liberaation has been built on swingneing tariff cuts. A simplified two-tier system means more than 80 per cent of Peru's imports enter the coua- try at the lower (15 per cnt) rate, the rest at 25 per mnt. A year ago, many ll o duced goodse d tive protection les weD oer formerly complex exchange rate system, with \"cheap\" dollars for favoured sectors which badly distorted local prices, has been unified and freed. Importers and exporters are no longer obliged ito negotiate their foreign cur- rency needs through the cen tral bank. Profits may be freely remitted abroad and almost anyone can import anything. Licences and red tape have been slashed. The result is a field day for importers and bet ter-off Peruvians. In Arequipa, agents estimate five times more cars are entering the country from the Chilean free zone, of Iquique than six months ago, while electronic goos and domestic appliancei iiorts have incrmatd thre fold.

The effects of an over-valued local currency (most exporters calculate the dollar is around 40 per cent of its true parity level) mean \"we're starting to see a reduc- tion in export billings in all sectors: mining, fishing and industry,\" Mr Raffo says. He is critical of the govern- ment's exchange rate manage- ment. \"It's the IMF's philoso- phy,\" he says. \"The economy must be stabilised, so we have to screw everybody, including the export sector until we get that done.\" Por most Peruvian exporters, the coming year will be about survival. The low, export-damaging dollar aries largely fom the ever-abundant supply of \"greenbacks\" flooding Peru from the illegal drgs trade, which brings in about $lba a year against legal exports around three es that.

Bush administration officials and congressmen have made t clear Israel must carry out economic reforms as a price for extra aid. Privatisation is a central plank of reform but there has been only limited progress since a large-scale sell-off was planned in 1988. A previous move to sell a 50 per cent stake in Israel Chemicals worth $400m to a private group was stopped by the Knesset finance committee, which has a virtual veto over privatisation policy. It objected to foreign takeover of the company. The prime minister's com- mittee decided instead to sell a 25 per cent stake in Israel Chemicals on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with a portion possibly to be floated on for- eign exchanges. This is due to be completed this year. Then a \"strategic partner\" will be sought to buy a 15 per cent stake. The intention is to reduce the state's holding to 28 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE NEXT two weeks are likely to see the US Democratic party's list of presi- dential candidates for 1992 filled out, as more contenders decide to run. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Gover- nor Douglas Wilder,of Virginia are among those most widely expected to make an announcement. They will join ex-Senator Paul Tsongas and Mr Larry Agran, the little-known former mayor of a small Californian town, who are so far the only declared candidates for the Democratic nomination. Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, is another possible in the race. But the candidate who is generating the most excitement in the Democratic camp is Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a war hero with strong views, a ferocious tongue and a string of successes in his brief political career. \"Democrats could do worse. Usually do. Probably will. But they should note that Bush's composure sometimes cracks under serious criticism, so a Democrat with Kerrey's bite would have an interesting edge,\" said Mr George Will, the conservative political commentator, a year ago. Senator Kerrey said last year he would not run for the presidency, but the lack of other candidates has made -him rethink. Should be decide to run, he could throw open a contest that had appeared ikely to turn into a duel between Sen- tor Harkin and Governor Clinton. The Iowa senator, a prairie populist who can deliver a rousing campaign speech, represents the traditionalit wing of,the party, with strong ties to trade union and civil rights movement and a commitment to activist govern- ment. 1 Governor Clinton, at 45 the US's aon. gest-serving governor, belongs to the Democratic Leadership Council, a revi- sionist wing of the party which wanti to get away from the Democrats' \"tax and spend\" image. He has the backing of the highly effective fund-raising team which won Governor Michael Dukakis the Democratic nomination in 1988. None of the candidates, however, is widely known outside his home state. \"They are not at this point national candidates,\" said Mr John White, a for- mer chairman of the Democratic National Committee, last week. Mr White said Governor Mario Cuomo of New York or Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrats' vice-presiden- tial candidate in 1988, might change their minds and run. Alternatively, if no contender won a clear lead in the primary elections, the party convention could pick a compromise candidate.",

   "text_content" : "By Bernard Simon in Torontt WITH a postal strike already under way and federal civil servants threatening to walk out later this week, Canada is bracing for the most disruptive labour action in recent years. The disputes, involving two of the public sector's biggest unions, reflect growing pres- sure on Canadian workers to adjust to a climate of greater fiscal restraint and increasing competitiveness. They also mark a challenge to govern- ment efforts to contain wage increases as a means to curtail- ing inflation. The stoppage by the 45,000- member Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) began last week on a \"rotating\" basis in various cities. Residential deliveries in Toronto and Mon- treal have stopped, but Canada Post is trying to continue ser- vice to businesses, using man- agers and temporary workers. The strike has been marred by violence and vandalism, including arson, to several temporary letter-sorting facili- ties set up by Canada Post. About 100,000 members of the Public Service Alliance, which represents a broad cross-section of civil servants, will be in a legal strike posi- tion this weekend. The union has already started some industrial action; customs offi- cers at US crossings threatened to work to rule yesterday. The public servants' union has rejected a government pro- posal to freeze wages this year, with increases of 3 per cent in 1992 and 1993. While wages are also an issue in the postal dispute, the main point of disagreement stems from Canada Post's strategy of \"contracting out\" various services to non-union, private suppliers. CUPW has demanded about 2,500 part-time jobs be converted to full-time positions.",

   "text_content" : "Noriega: defence claims he was paid more than $20m r';,f HKE trial of General Manuel Noriega on T drug-trafficking charges, which opens in the Miami federal district court tomorrow with jury selection, may bring revelations about the roles played by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce international in Latin Ameri- can arms and narcotic trade. Then again, it may not. But whether proceedings provide a glimpse into the operational side of US intelli- gence and its alleged links to international crime, or remain merely a drug-trafficking trial, the prosecution of Gen Noriega, who was at the time of his arrest the de facto head of the Panamanian govern- mient, marks an extension of the scope the US government claims for its right to enforce domestic law. . When Gen Noriega was indicted in Miami in 1988, the government attempted to bring him to trial on charges that he had assisted the Colombian cocaine cartels in shipping drugs to the US. President George Bush launched the invasion of Pan- ama in December 1989, saying the apprehension of Gen Noriega was a key goal. On January 4 1990 the general walked out of the Vatican embassy and was flown to Miami, where he has since been confined. After the invasion, US offi- cials in Panama took journal- ists on tours of the general's home and pointed out artifacts which they said indicated the general was an admirer of Hit- ler and a devotee of witchcraft. The defence questioned whether the general could get a fair trial after such publicity. Questions were also raised by domestic critics about whether the government had the right to bring Gen Noriega to trial in the US. But the general's lawyers were unable to convince Fed- eral District Judge William Hoeveler, in whose court the eneral's case is being heard, 'hat their client had been improperly arrested, that his rights had been violated, or that the US had used excessive force in his capture. Those were just the first of a spate of issues the judge has had to decide in the 19 months since Gen Noriega's arrival in Florida. The judge had to broker a complicated international legal arrangement to persuade Euro- pean bankers to release funds rom Gen Noriega's frozen accounts so he could pay his lwyers. He also had to rule on iasplex issues involvng alle- ations of government muprc- priety in listening in to the rinmer's telephone conversa as with his lawyers. But the main pretrial battle between the government and defence, carried on largely berd closed doors, has been a tri le over the scrp t of evi- dence the defence will be allowed to present. The defence team, led by Mr Frank Rubino, has sought to force the release of large num- bers of classified documents which they allege will show that whatever Gen Noriega did for or with narcotics traffickers was part of an overall relation- ship he had with US intelli- gence aqencies. The defence argues that Gen Noriega was so valuable to the agencies that they paid him more than $20m (Â£11.9m). The government has acknowledged Gen Noriega was on the pay- rolls of intelligence agencies, but they say he received less Henry Hamman on the former military strongman's trial, which begins in Miami tomorrow than the defence alleges. The defence has also filed documents alleging that Gen Noriega allowed illegal weap- ons shipments through Pan- ama at the behest of seven directors of the CIA, including now-President George Bush. The defence has said it expects to subpoena Mr Bush to testify during the trial. Judge Hoeveler has issued sealed orders for the release to the defence of classified docu- ments which the defence says will show the depth of the rela- tionship between the general and US intelligence agencies. Government attorneys deny the judge's rulings will put the relationship between the gen- eral and the intelligence com- munity on trial. The general's case may also find a place in the BCCI scan- dal. The general maintained accounts with the bank, and the government of Panama charged in a lawsuit filed in Miami last month that BCCI assisted Gen Noriega in laun- dering funds earned from traf- sicking payoffs. Earlier this month the Wash- ington Post newspaper quoted US investigators as saying Col- ombian drug cartels had moved nearly $1bn in drug profits through BCCI, mainly through branches in Panama, while the bank enjoyed the protection of Gen Noriega. Doc- uments the government has turned over to the defence team, including Gen Noriega's BCCI account records, indicate that part of the prosecution strategy will be to focus on sources of his wealth. The trial will resemble a David and Goliath struggle. The defence team is made up of Mr Rubino, Mr Jon May and a small staff of investigators and aides. The government is believed to have deployed at least 20 lawyers. In addition to members of the Miami Attor- ney-General's office, special staff has been sent",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters PRICE Waterhouse launched a bitter attack on the former chief financial officer of BCCI yesterday over his criticisms of the firm's audit of the bank. The firm, in its first public statement since BCCI was closed in July, was responding to public comments by Mr Masihur Rahman, BCCFs chief financial officer until August 1990. In testimony before a Senate sub-committee in the US in August and in an interview with the Observer newspaper last weekend, Mr Rahman had sharply criticised Price Water- house and the Bank of England for not having acted sooner over BCCI. Price Waterhouse said yes- terday that Mr Rahman had \"misrepresented\" the facts, adding that, as a member of BCCI's treasury committee and from his attendance at BCCI audit committee meet- ings, he was aware of the true position. The auditors added: \"Mr Rahman, as chief sinan- cial officer of BCCI, shares management responsibility for internal financial controls and the proper presentation of financial statements.\" Price Waterhouse said it was prevented from \"refuting each individual misstatement\" by the requirements of the Banking Act 1987 and client confidentiality. It said it was co-operating with official inquiries into the BCCI affair and \"looks for- ward to all findings which relate to the role of Price Waterhouse in uncovering the fraud being made public\". * Authorities in the Cayman Islands are seeking an earlier deadline for the restructuring of BCCI than the four months granted by a UK court last month. The Cayman government's reluctance to postpone the restructuring until December is expected to emerge at a court hearing in Grand Cay- man today. It will consider an application by the governor for a winding-up order on BCCI's operations in the Carib- bean tax haven."

Mr Justice Mummery heard that the latest asset-freezing move, involving US$23m, was made after recent newspaper allegations relating to the col- lapse of CCL. Mr John McDonnell QC, for the Republic of Panama, said it claimed that money was secreted by General Noriega through various BCC1 bodies. The Panamanian govern- ment said it was beneficial owner of the $23m paid into a London branch in September 1988 for the account of Finley International, a London com- pany. The judge grazted the Panamanian government injunctions restraining a num- ber of defendants from dispos- ing of the sum pending a fur- ther hearing on Thursday when all the parties involved can be represented.

   "text_content" : "A SPECIAL prosecutor has enough evidence to bring charges against two former Peruvian government officials said to have taken bribes from BCCI, Mr Pedro Mendez, Peru's attorney-general said yester- day. Reuter reports hom Lima. The two are Mr Leonel Fignu- eroa, a former Peruvian central bank president, and Mr Hector Neyra, general manager. Mr Mendez said others might also be charged, but he declined to name them. \"They were not acting alone,\" he said, adding: \"There will be some very inter- esting surprises. \"A of the elements to sus- tain the charges have been col- lected,\" Mr Mendez said. \"We can affirm that charges will be brought.\" He was speaking at a press conference in Lima having returned from Washington and New York, where he had met officials from the office of Mr Itobert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney. Mr Morgenthau named Mr Figueroa and Mr Neyra in July as having accepted $3m in bribes from BCCI in return for depositing up to $270m of Peru's reserves in the bank. The $270m deposit was made at a time when the country's reserves were likely to be seized elsewhere to satisfy its debt. The two officials were not charged in a sweeping indict- ment charging BCCI with the largest bank fraud in history. Mr Mendez said the defini- tive proof that a bribe had been paid was in Panama, where money in the names of Mr Neyra and Mr Figueroa was allegedly deposited in a coded account. Once charges had been filed, the Panamanian government could be willing to lift its bank- ing secrecy laws to provide evi- dence in the case, he added. Mr Mendez said a special prosecutor was putting the \"final touches\" to the docu- mentation and that the charges would be announced in the next few days. Mr Figueroa and Mr Neyra failed to appear last month before a US Senate commission investigating possible wrong- doing in the BCCI case and their whereabouts are unknown. Mr Adolfo Cuba y Escobedo, the Peruvian police chief, said last week that Mr Neyra had fled the country.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster HONG KONG yesterday moved a step closer to securing a buyer for the local arm of BCCI when the government's provi sional liquidator signed condi- tional heads of agreement with the Hongkong Chinese Bank, part of the Lippo group from Indonesia. The agreement, which amounts to a serious statement of intent, depends on a number of legal conditions being met. It will also require approval from the courts and Hong Kong's banking regulators. The Hongkong Chinese Bank also needs to secure agreement from large depositors not to withdraw all deposits. The pro- visional liquidator is seeking a guarantee from the Abu Dhabi government to cover any unre- corded liabilities. Abu Dhabi has indicated that it could provide a guaran- tee, but its terms are not yet satisfactory to Hong Kong. Under the agreement, the assets and liabilities of Bank of Credit and Commerce (Hong Kong) will be acquired by a new banking company, of which at least 51 per cent will be owned by Hongkong Chi- nese Bank. BCC(HK) has not been implicated in the fraud and other troubles elsewhere in the group. Editorial comment, Page 16",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent GROUP LOTUS, the UK sports carmaker and automotive engi- neering consultancy, is cutting its car manufacturing work- force by a third in the face of a big drop in forecast sales in the US. oItus Cars, the loss-making car division, is reducing its workforce at Hethel, Norfolk, from 900 to about 600. It is also reducing the size of its US distribution operations in Atlanta, Georgia, although Mr Michael Kimberley, Group Lotus chief executive, said the company was committed to staying in the US market. The job cuts at the car divi- sion will reduce the total work- force of Group Lotus, a subsid- iary of General Motors of the US, from 1,755 to about 1,450. Lotus Engineering and the Mlllbrook proving ground will not be affected. The job cuts at Lotus follow similar reductions at Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury car makers, which have also suffered from a sharp fall in US sales. Lotus had forecast a big jump in car output, helped by the launch of its Elan sports car in the US early this year. It had expected sales of about 950 Elans in the US in the whole of 1991, but sales are now likely to total no more than 350. Lotus car output for 1991 is being cut to 2,700 from the 3,280 envisaged at the begin- ning of the year. Production is expected to fall to 2,350 in 1992. Lotus also produces about 500 models a year of the Lotus Omega/Carlton saloon for Gen- eral Motors. Lotus car output this year will still be about 35 per cent higher than the 1,997 achieved in 1990. Mr Kimberley said that Lotus had expected to derive about a third of its car sales from north America, a third from Europe and a third from the Far East, but it had been forced to reduce its planned volumes sharply in the US. It was essential to take \"appropriate and prudent action\" to protect the com- pany's \"core operations\", Mr Kimberley said. Design pool, Page 19",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waters THE expected overhaul of the London Stock Exchange's gov- erning board was announced yesterday, as 14 proposed new directors for the market were named. The slate of new directors, which will bring senior figures from industry and commerce on to the exchange's governing body for the first time, is part of the attempt by Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman, and Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive, to transform the organisation from a club into a more effec- tive commercial enterprise. All 14 of the proposed direc- tors, with 11 representatives from the exchange's now defunct governing council, will face election to the market's new board at an extraordinary meeting in early October. Three chairmen of public companies have accepted invi- tations to stand as directors: Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of National Westmin- ster Bank; Mr Anthony Ten- nant, chairman of Guinness; and Mr Ian MacPherson, chair- man of Low & Bonar, the man- ufacturing company. They are joined by two fund managers, Mr Donald Brydon, chairman of BZW Asset Man- agement, and Mr John Web- ster, managing director of Sun Life Asset Management, who is at present a council member. The list of new names also contains some of the most pow- erful figures in the London securities markets. From UK- based houses, those up for elec- tion include Mr John Kemp- Welch, senior partner of Caze- nove; Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court; and Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, chairman of Warburg Securi- ties. Foreign houses are repre- sented by Mr Rudolf Mueller, chairman and chief executive of UBS Phillips & Drew, and Mr Koichi Kane, the new chair- man of Nomura International. The proposed new directors will replace 19 council mem- bers who stood down yester- day. Most were less senior in their companies and put a con- siderable amount of time into the exchange, including attend- ing monthly council meetings and sitting on exchange com- mittees. New board members, who will be paid Â£12,500 a year each, will attend board meet- ings once every six weeks, and new audit and remuneration committees will be drawn from their numbers. The list contains the chair- men of the London arms of Nomura and Salomon Brothers, both of which have been embroiled in scandals this summer. Mr Hugh Smith said he was satisfied that nei- ther man had been involved in the scandals at their compa- nies. The new board, expected to meet for the first time in the middle of October, will come together at a critical time for the exchange. Its strategy, under review for several months, is still some way from being finalised, while it is becoming increasingly likely that Taurus, its long-awaited settlement system, will miss its target launch next May. Mr Rawlins said yesterday that briefing sessions for new directors would begin at the end of this week, although it would not be until next spring that they were fully up to speed on all the issues affect- ing the organisation. \"They will not be asked to rubber-stamp what has gone before,\" he said. Mr Hugh Smith said a small number of people had declined invitations to stand for election to the new board, although he did not name them. The 25- member board is expected to shrink over time, he added.",

Mr Lilley claimed that the government provided compara- tively high levels of financial support to stimulate innova- tion in industry. The chal- lenge, however, was to over- come a national culture largely antipathetic to innovation and stimulate the private sector into giving it a higher priority. Mr Lilley was speaking at the launch of a handbook by the Innovation Advisory Board to boost nrnovation by improv- ig comnumunications between companies and the investment community. He said he was encouraged by the increase of 50 per cent in real terms in investment in research and development investment by industry in the six years until 1989, but that companies were still not doing enough to match and surpass the efforts of their best overseas competitors. Mr Lilley said the govern- ment was anxious to ensure companies and investors that it appreciated the relevance of innovation to competitiveness and realised that short-term costs were outweighed by long-term benefits.

   "text_content" : "Tim Lawrence reports on the disappointing race for council sports and leisure management contracts F THE introduction of compulsory competitive tendering into sports and leisure management were an athletics contest, it would be postponed indefinitely. The competitors not only look like being slow off the starting blocks - there are too few of them to make the race worthwhile. Only a few results from the first wave of tenders have been announced - the rest will fol- low over the next couple of months - but two clear trends are emerging. First, a competitive market for the tenders has failed to materialise, with the over- whelming majority of contracts being won by staff direct-ser- vice organisations. Mr lan McNicol, principal consultant at Leisure Futures, a consultancy specialising in tendering, predicts that more than nine tenths of sports and leisure contracts will be won by the councils' direct service organisations, former munici- pal workorces restructured into semi-a omous contrac- tors. He said: \"The competition which the leIslation assumed existed and which Is needed to produce a healthy market sim- ply hasn't matrialed.\" Second, where there is com- petition for the tender, it is usualy limited. eisure man- ageaent businesses tend to target authorities - usually Conservative - that favour the introduction of compulsory tendering, and while more than e ompany might com pte in such a tender thco- cil sually will not.

The majority of compa- nies entering the sports and leisure market have been set up expressly to win council contracts. Often run by former local-authority managers, they are small and have a limited capacity to expand. For example, DC Leisure - an offshoot of Crossland Lei- sure, which won the irst ever leisure management contract, from Surrey Heath Borough Council for the Arena Leisure Centre in Camberley in 1964 - manages five leisure centres in Surrey and is bidding for seven more in the current tranche. Mr Tim Caunter, contracts director at DC Leisure, said. In terms of growth strategy we want to be succissl in three or four of these bids\" Anoher reson that compe- tition is unlikely to emerge on any aignificant scale is the lim- ited scope for substantial prof- its in sports and leisure man- agement. Incal authorities will con- imnue to set the prices for heil- ties, so profits depend on creasing the number f cus- tomers.

There will be an opportunity to re-bid in the second and third tender round, which wil follow in August IS and Jan- uary 1993, but in practice the tight time scale of the tranchesi makes it impractical.

   "text_content" : "sy Cha rts I0 helor MOST finance directors regard the prime aim of their treasury management duties as minim ising risks rather than maxim ising returns, according to a survey commissioned by 31, the venture capital company owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks. Two thirds of the finance directors who participated in the survey opted for a risk- averse strategy, with fewer than a third saying their role was to maximise returns. A total of 212 directors took part in the poll of a sample of the 750 largest UK quoted compa- nies. Only 22 per cent of finance directors regarded treasury management as a potential profit centre. Maiy felt that expecting treasury activities to make profits might divert man- agement from its mainstream activity and mean that group objectives would be dlouded. Yet even if' treasury operations were encouraged to make profits, therd tas little prospect of banks' receiving a cut. The favoured method of conducting treasury operations was to do as much work inter- nally as possible and to use the banks only to execite'orders, most financial directors said. Sixty-eight -per cent of finance directors polled thought British industry would benefit from the introduction of a single European: currency, 28 per cent \"greatly\"!a;nd 40 per cent only \"a little.\" Although most reported that their company's sensitivity to exchange re fluctuations had Increased over the past five years, the main fluctuations were between the dollar, the yen and the European curren- cies, rather than between Euro- pean currencies themselves. Most finance directors believed entry to the European exchange rate mechanism would be very beneficial to the UK economy in the long run,, but only 23 per cent said it would have an impact on their company. That was probably because most large companies, already operated globally, so a change in the rules governing just one currency, even if it was their home currency, was not of geat significance, the survey said. The -survey showed that respondents were able to keep a close eye on their company's financial position, with more than (0 per cent receiving data on turnover, margins and the average period of unpaid bills within 10 days of the end of each month. Most had group figures within 15 days of the month end. Asked how far ahead they forecast financial items, 42 per cent of finance directors said they forecast their cash posi- tion one month in advance, while 43 per cent made quar- terly forecasts and 73 per cent annual forecasts. Cash was the iniost frequently forecast item, followed by turnover (which 39 per cent forecast monthly) and margins (86 per cent monthly), the survey found. f Finance directors said their tore responsibilities were financial control, ensuring jaccess to borrowing facilities, ,treasury operations and pro- viding management accounts. ,However, many finance direc- tors felt they made their big- gest contribution to enhancing shareholder value by taking part in strategic policy deci- sions and in managing acquisi- tions and divestments.

Residents also complain of II health and interference with television recep- lion as a result of the work. The legal action is being led by South Poplar and Limehouse Action for Secure Housing (Splash), which rep- resents local tenants' organisations. They intend to claim from the London Docklands Development Corporation, the body set up by the government to regenerate the area, and from Olympia & York, developer of the com- plex with its 800ft tower. Both yesterday rejected claims that they were liable for disrup- Tony Andrews tion to the lives of local residents. Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the corporation, said some disruption was necessary to bring new jobs and businesses to the area. Olympia & York, the developer of the 800ft Canary Wharf tower, said it was confident it had no legal liability and would contest any proceedings. Observer, Page 16",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-03",
   "text_content" : "By U\" Wood, Labour Staff THE LABOUR party yesterday sought to distance itself from a decision by unions to boycott the government's Â£230m tempo- rary-work scheme for the long-term unemployed. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said it was \"not a good idea\" to with- draw from Employment Action (EA). However, Mr Blair, who has announced Labour's plans for a larger temporary work scheme that paid the rate for the job, rather than benefit plus Â£10, as proposed for EA, said the unions' criticism of the government's scheme was entirely valid. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, speak- ing at a press conference in London, accused trade union leaders of \"turning their backs on the unemployed of the country\". The motion opposing EA was proposed by Mr Alan Jinkin- son, general secretary of Nalgo, the public-service union. He said his union was not opposed to the principle of temporary work for those who needed jobs rather than train- ing and which paid the rate for the job. He condemned EA, which will provide 30,000 work experi- ence places this year as \"cruel, cynical, stony-hearted, skin- flint opportunism\". The only support for the scheme at congress came from Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEU engineering union and a member of the National Train- ing Task Force. He said ithe scheme should not be boycot- ted if it offered the unemployed a glimmer of hope. Training organisations said yesterday that the practical implications of the boycott on EA were likely to be limited, on the lines of the previous attempt at not co-operating with Employment Training, a much larger scheme for unem- ployed adults. In 1988 the Trades Union Congress formally opposed ET but it did not advocate a for- mal boycott. Rather, congress made what one union leader called a \"shabby little compro- mise\" and urged that unions individually should seek to remove the scheme. The impact on ET was negli- gible. A few large employers declined to take part because they did not want to irritate their unions. Some Labour local authorities did not take part, but sufficient places were available from other sources wr for the scheme to operate by including voluntary organisa- tions. The new scheme will be administered mainly by Train- ing and Enterprise Councils. They will contract with provid- ers inlcluding local authorities and voluntary organisations. A few charities, including Apex Trust, which works on behalf of ex-offenders, have said already they will not take part in EA because of its lim- ited training opportunities. Others, including Nacro, which also helps ex-offenders, have said they are prepared to take part in EA where schemes are quality ones and bring gen- uine benefits to participants. Ms Molly Meacher, of Cam- paign for Work, the research organisation, said: \"The gov- ernment is relying on volun- tary organisations which are pressed for cash to implement a programme which it knows will have limited appeal to the unemployed.\" Ms Meacher said research had showed that many private- sector employers were unwill- ing to take part in the scheme because of the recession and difficulties in taking on people when they were making their own employees redundant.",

   "text_content" : "By Alison Smith LABOUR'S ties with the unions were the target of a Tory autumn offensive yester- day as the Conservatives launched a campaign to coin- cide with the TUC conference. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said Labour policy in a range of areas, such as energy policy and competitive tendering in the NHS, bore \"the bootprint of union influence\". Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, called the links between Labour and the unions \"the most outdated and potentially harmful relation- ship in British politics\". In support of their belief that the public is uneasy about the extent of union influence on a Labour government, the Tories cited a Gallup poll for The Sun- day Telegraph showing one in four voters said Labour's being \"in the pocket of the trade unions\" was a reason for not voting for the party. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said Mr Howard's \"ever more wild and intemperate\" attacks mis- judged the public mood, which did not want special privileges for unions but \"believes they have every right to exist in a democratic society and wants to move forward to the issue of the 1990s rather than re-run the battles of the '70s\". Citing union contributions to the Labour party and their vot- ing rights in conference and in selection procedures, Mr Pat- ten rejected comparisons with contributions to Tory funds by big companies. Donations to the Conserva- tives did not \"buy policies and favours\", and companies' con- tributions to political organisa- tions had to be declared and could be voted on by share- holders. While promising an autumn of campaigning across a range of issues in the run up to the party conference in Blackpool next month, Mr Patten contin- ued to express the view that the party should defer the elec- tion until next year.",

   "text_content" : "HE DECLINE of Britain's heavy industry is surely symbolised by the fact that this year's Trades Union Congress is being held in a spanking new exhibition centre built on the site of the Glasgow docks. During the First World War, Clydeside had the biggest con- centration of munitions pro- duction in the UK, much of the output shipped through the docks to Slanders fields. Now the long-closed docks echo to salvoes of hot air, much of it pleading with the UK govern- ment to adopt the industrial relations practices of the Kai- ser's heirs. The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre is a vast shell of a building that can accommodate events as varied as the Roberts Brothers circus, the Ice Cream Alliance confer- ence, the Scottish Ski and Win- ter Show and Gary Glitter's Christmas Gangshow. The TUC's autumn gang- show rattles about in one cor- ner of what appears to be an aircraft hangar served by an inadequate public address sys- tem. But, unlike Gary Glitter, fUC NOTEBOOK By John Willman the TUC's main aim this week is to avoid golden oldies - splits over issues such as incomes policy and trade union legislation, which the govern- ment would exploit in the gen- eral election campaign. Chief talking point as the 937 delegates gathered was whether Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretgry, should remain leader of the gang. A straw poll of union leaders in New Statesman and Society magazine rated Mr Wil- lis second from bottom. In the true spirit of fraternity, the respondents had offered com- ments such as \"just not up: to it\" and \"it's time he resigned.\" Would Norman follow the example of his two predeces- sors and take early retirement? Or would an emergency com- mittee headed by the granite- faced TUC president Alec Smith declare that Mr Willis was ailing and relieve him of his duties? The presence of a frigate in the Clyde outside the confer- ence centre only helped to increase speculation. Mr Willis moved firmly to head off any challenge. While the TUC was not out of \"every conceivable wood yet\", he had a \"small gut feellng\" (a refer- ence to the three stone he has shed) that he would be staying on for a bit longer. The fact that he has just been elected president of the European Trade Union Confederation may protect him from detrac- tors - a coup before the end of his year in office is unlikely. Mr Willis also poured cold water on the validity of the poll, a dubious tactic at a press conference called to present the findings of yet another poll on what the people think of unions. Only 38 sneering traitors had completed the New Statesman survey (out of 100 question- naires sent out), and no senior union leader would admit to having been among them. Given the success of Jimmie Airlie, the relatively unknown Clydeside engineer, and Jimmy Knapp, the rail union leader with the impenetrable Scots accent, it seems likely that many of the guilty hail from north of the border. But then, Scots have the lux- ury of their own republican leader in Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scot- tish TUC. Not only is he rather leaner and fitter than Mr Willis, he is able to finish his sentences. More important, the STUC remains a power in the land, even after 12 years of Conser- vative rule. Respected and consulted by Scottish employers, local gov- ernment and community organisations, Mr Christie is at the heart of the debate over devolution from Westmin- ster. As Norman begins yet another of his unscripted and rambling replies to a debate, the TUC general council may yet regret not having moved while he was on holiday."

   "text_content" : "By Mihael Smhlh, Labour Correspondent A POLITICALLY sensitive dispute has broken out between two public'sector unies over attempts by one, the Association of First Dlvi- dton Civil Servants (PDA), to take into mmbership a group of workes that Nalgo belevms it should represent. Nalgo has asked the Trades Union Congress to role that the FDA would be breaking inter-union rules governing membership disputes. A deci- sion in Nalg's favour would almost certainly be used by the government to strengthen its argument that the TUC should not be allowed to decide spheres of influence for unions in recruitment. It has already published a green paper containing pro- posals that would weaken the TUC's adjudication role by giv- ing Individuals a legal right to join the union of their choice. The dispute between the FDA and Nalgo began when the Civil Service union was approached for membership by a group of health service man- agers. Since then, about m00 managers have been sent details of the services provided by the FDA, although it says they were circulated by mem- bers of the original group of members, not the union Itself. Mr Keith Sonnet, Nalgo assistant general secretary, said his union had asked for a TUC disputes panel to rule that by giving membership to the health service managers the FDA would be moving into another union's sphere of influence and so break the socalled Bridlington rules on inter-union disputes. He said the FDA did not have bargaining rights in the health service, while Nalgo had organised there for many years. Ms Liz Symons, FDA general secretary, said her union had complained to the TUC on the ground that Nalgo was acting unreasonably. The FDA had not gone out to recruit the managers. They had approached it because they were drawn by the ser- vices it offered to people who were on individual contracts.",

   "text_content" : "David Goodhart on moves to make works councils more influential SHE GROWMING body of opinion within Britain's ;union elite wants to oury 100 years of AnglsoSaxor trade union tradition in the name of continental European consensus. The \"voluntarist\" model, which kept the law out of worker-management relations, and the conflict in, has proved of little benefit to workers of the past decade and has, in any case, been partly undermined by the Conservative employ ment laws. Those legal restrictions are here to stay, even under a Labour government, so why should British workers not also receive the benefits of the more codified continental sys- tem? \"We now have legal restrictions similar to parts of the Continent without the posi- tive rights to participation and information,\" says one senior TUC official. British unions have been casting envious glances at con- tinental, and especially Ger- man, industrial relations for many years. Now, for the first time since the abortive indus- trial democracy debate of the 1970s, British unions are actu ally examining whether, for example, elections to works councils can be adapted to Britain's multi-union plants. Supporters of the German model, led by Mr John Edmonds of the GMB, still have many people to convince, even within their own ranks. Hostility to that model has been based not only on the per- ceived restrictions, such as legally binding agreements or severe restraints on strike action, but also on the fact that positive rights and institutions, such as works councils, are provided for employees and not unions. (Even so, the unions in Germany dominate the coun cils). Leftwing unions such as the Transport and General Work ers Union, and even some lead- ing TUC officials, still have res ervations about establishing channels that might compete with trade union ones and strongly oppose the manage mnent-dominated. Franco-Japa- nase company councils. More broadly, they fear granting rights at work that make union organisation superfluous; few union officials want to put themselves out of a job. Even conservative union Bill Jordan: presided over creation of several councils ___ leaders such as Mr Gavin Laird of the Amalgamated Engineer- ing Union are coming round to the view that the old system must go. \"I'm convinced we need a change,\" Mr Laird says, \"but Im not yet convinced the German model is the alterna- tive.\" The election of a Labour gov- ernment would increase the likelihood of positive rights for employees, although first prior- ity might be given to a new law on union recognition. There was scarcely a mention of European-style participation and information rights in Labour's long policy review, but Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, is a supporter and says legislation on employee rights will be a Labour government priority. Mr Blair, like Mr Edmonds, sees improved consultation rights running parallel with a reform of Britain's anarchic and decentralised wage bar- gaining system. One of the strengths of the German system is that bar- gaining, and the conflicts it creates, take place outside indi- vidual plants at regional or national level. Works councils in plants have considerable powers of veto and can decide how to apply locally the bar- gaining results reached nation- ally, but they cannot call strikes. Mr Blair is understandably cautious about reopening the Bullock debate on full-scale co- determination with worker rep- resentatives on company boards - but some national system 'of works councils, incorporating employee rights to consultation an informa- tion in bigger plants, might well be in place in five years' time. Even another Conservative government, keen to prove its Christian Democratic creden- tials, might find some version of it acceptable. The unions are no longer despised and the idea of more employee rights, as opposed to union rights, remains popular with the elec- torate. Supporters of the German model argue that some version of the system will be imposed in any case by the EC. The two proposals for worker participa- tion, one associated with the EC company statute, the other with the social action pro- gramme will eventually be established in some form. Also, although transnational bargaining remains in its infancy, even in the EC, an increasing number of British union officials are involved in European works councils, many of them encouraged by multinational companies. Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEU, has presided over the creation of several such coun- cils as chairman of the Euro- pean Metalworkers' Federa- tion. It is the irreversible decline of traditional trade unionism and the weakness of organised labour in growth sectors that may, paradoxically, be the best argument for more employee power. Introducing the Ger- man model a decade ago would have led to its abuse by still adversarial unions and would have blocked necessary restructuring. The more mod- est unions of today are now ready for \"social partnership\" because they know that other- wise they will virtually disap- pear. Employers will not be so keen. As Mr Edmonds points out, the consensus system in Germany is fully supported by employers in order to avoid competing over the price of Labour. \"But unfortunately, in Britain, reducing the price of labour is the only thing they do compete on,\" he says. Nev- ertheless, employers may have to respond to an industrial relations agenda set by unions for the first time in 10 years.",

The sim- pler suggestions made by Richer's staff win between Â£5 Â£ad Â£25 while the people who nake the best two suggestions each quarter win a gold badge fanother part of the company's incentive scheme) and a trip bn the Orient Express. * Once regarded as only being appropriate in large manufac- luring companies, suggestion schemes have increasingly lound favour in white-collar prganisations like banks and building societies. And while large organisations such as British Airways and the Inland Revenue run successful :schemes, some privately-owned businesses and small divisions .of large companies have also ffound them to be of value. Jean Balcombe, co-ordinator :of the Industrial Society's sug- gestion scheme campaign, esti- mates that between 400 and 500 'schemes are in operation in Britain. The UK Association of Suggestion Schemes (UKASS),* founded in 1987, has just over 100 members, although Andrew Wood, chairman, expects more companies to join. the most recent survey of suggestion schemes, carried out by the Industrial Society in 1988, showed that the 103 schemes identified had received more than 73,400 su gestions or five for every 1 employees. Just over 16,01 suggestions were adopted, success rate of 22 per cent. The traditional view of 5u gestion schemes was that th were a way of saving a cord pany money. Since employee were so clodely involved in the details of manufacturing a par. ticular product they were well placed to suggest ways of mak- ing it more quickly or cheaply. Dunlop General Rubber Products, a Manchester-baseQl subsidiary of the BTR group, reduced waste and saved Â£7,500 a year when it took up an employee's suggestion to change the way it cut the foam-rubber used in vehicle mats. This was just one of between 150 and 200 suggestions made each year by the 210 employees eligible for the scheme (about 35 managers and senior staff may not participate). Dunlop rewyards suggestions which are adopted with a cash paymeit of 20 per cent of the value Of the mnnual saving up to a ma- imuin of Â£1,000, explains DatE Mithell, quality supervisor and administrator of the sg- gestn scheme. Th top saving made as a esul of Dunlop's Bright Spark scheme was just over Â£12,000 for a method of removing sur- face blgemishes from rubber products while total savings in one year from the suggestion scheme were Â£51,000. While many suggestions do enable companies to save money, schemes are being increasingly used to make improvements in areas such as quality or customer care where the Gavings, if any, are difficult to quantify. In addition, many companies :elieve suggestion schemes can make a contribution to staif morale, showing people that their contribution to the com- pany is valued. \"S4ggestion schemes have become an integral part ps comnunications and manage- in owyar rIroi mDunlop's oug lon ment development policy and are no longer seen just as a way of saving money,\" com- ments Jean Balcombe. \"If they are handled carefully and given top management support they can be a powerful motiva- tor for employees.\" To succeed, suggestion schemes must meet a number of criteria: * They must be carefully planned and provided with the esources and management backing to sustain them over the long term. \"There are a lot of dead schemes around,\" says Balcombe. \"They die very quickly if they are not properly rin.\" Several schemes running when the Industrial Society carried out its 1988 survey have since folded. Angus Modelmakers, a Glasgow com- pany employing 27 people, said it dropped its scheme a year ago because of \"patchy response\". Interox Chemicals, part of the Laporte group, said its suggestion scheme was '\"in abeyance\" after the flow of suggestions dried up two years ago. * They require constant pro- motion. \"We have a virtually continuous publicity cam- paign,\" says Dunlop's Mitchell. \"As soon as you stop putting articles in the company maga- zine people forget about it.\" The Dunlop scheme, which dates back to 1929, fell into dis- use in the mid-1980s and drew just four suggestions in 1986 but has since been revived and now attracts more than 150 a year. * They should be fun. Dunlop gives away pens with the com- pany logo to all suggesters and a mug bearing the legend \"I am a Dunlop Bright Spark\" to people submitting ideas which are adopted. Balcombe suggests that schemes be enlivened with short-term campaigns aimed at encouraging suggestions in areas such as energy-saving, the environment or customer care. League tables, a lucky dip from a tub of accumulated sug- gestions or a chairman's pdrize for the best of the year, can all sustain Interest. * Suggestions must be han- dled quickly apd efficiently. \"If the guys on the shop floor have an idea and get excited they should not be kept waiting more than .24 hours for an acknowledg eent,\" advises Jim Byersofi. Ingersoll Engi- neers, a nbnufacturlng consul- tancy. \"The company should then come up with a response to the suggestion within a week.\" If the suggestion is turned down, employees, should be encour- aged to submit new ones. Dun- lop describes ideas it turns down as \"riot adopted\" rather than.\"rejected\". * Suggestions should be rewarded - though opinions differ on the scale of payment. \"The rewards should be signifl- cant,\" says Balcombe. Busi- nessmen like Richer, however, believe in giving \"a little and often\". On average, schemes surveyed by the Industrial Society paid out 18 per cent of the savings made. As businesses have taken to the idea of quality circles - which bring workers together in groups to improve produc- tion quality - and total quality management as methods of ensuring higher standards, so some have come to regard sug- gestion schemes as \"old hat\". Gates Hydraulics, a St Neots, Cambridgeshire company mak- ing hose and tube assemblies, dropped its suggestion scheme when it adopted quality circles for its 330 employees. The sug- gestion scheme had not led to any significant improvements, say Graham Webb, personnel But the move to more broadly based quality pro- grammes need not signal the end of suggestion schemes. Dunlop is introducing BS5750, the main UK quality standard, and intends to keep its sugges- tion scheme, although Mitchell wonders what would happen if the BS5750 procedure and the scheme both throw up the same suggestion for improve- ments. Modern quality methods encourage people to work as teams, says Andrew Wood of UKASS. There is still a place for a system which encourages the individual to come up with good ideas. *UKASS.

The banker's perspective forms an Importantpt of a guide entitled Financing through the Recesson* rom accountants BDO Binder Ham lyn. ' Lndin decisions are inflnu enced by the bank manager' impression of the manage ment's abilities rather than by fancy numbers on a glossy business plan. The lender has to be convinced that the owner-manager can conceive and carry ont a workable busi- ness strategy which will enable him to repay the debt without difficulty. The bank manager will assess the business customer on his degree of commitment, his ability to take decisions and to delegate authority and his skills in managing the risks to which the business is exposed, the guide suggests. The initial decision to lend ill be influenced by the impression created by the . gaagement but the extent of t'e finance which is made available will depend on the security provided by the assets fthey had to be disposed of in = forced sale. Freeholds and leaseholds mirght count for up to 75 per cent of their market value while plant and machinery might be valued at just 10 per cent. Invoices which are not yet more than 90 days old might typically be valued at between 50 and 80 per cent and work In progress at up to 50 per cent. Higher values may be attri- buted to assets when the loan is made on a specific \"asset finance\" basis, where the lender is more familiar with the nature and value of the assets and where the compa- ny's figures can be monitored more regularly. If a company runs into prob- :ems the bank manager is likely to be alerted by a num her of danger signals: P Frequent *equests for temn porary Increases In the loan facility, often on quarter days, when the company has to make interest payments. * Immediate and fall use of the available facility and diffi- culties in meeting repayment schedules. * The breaking of covenants governing ratios such as loans to equity and interest pay- ments to pre-tax profits. The bank may respond by reducing facilities or increas- ing the security required; checking the value of existing securities; or refusing to increase its exposure. It may insist on appointing non-exec- utive directors to the board or seek an independent opinion either from a member of its own \"recoveries\" section or from a firm of accountants. The guide also considers alternative forms of funding including factoring, leasing and venture capital and pro- vides hints on how to deal with dubious cheques. *Special Briefing No 71.

Members of the Association of British Factors and Discounters absorbed 3,644 debts with a value of Â£6.46m compared with 2,659 debts worth Â£5.39m in the first half of 1990. The value of sales factored by British business continued to rise - by 2.2 per cent to Â£6.86bn in the 12 months to June 1991 - though at a much slower rate than the 18 per cent growth of the previous 12 months. The average collection time for invoices handled by a factor was 65 days compared with about 90 days for unfactored invoices, the association reported. * Free advice on design problems will be available to companies and individuals on Merseyside at a Design Council Design Surgery to be held on September 11. The advice available covers areas such as design protection, packaging, industrial and engineering design and the diagnosis of design problems. Contact the Merseyside Innovation Centre. Tel 051 708 012& * The National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses is calling for a simplified version of the BS5750 quality assurance standard to be made available for small businesses. This follows a poll of members in which one in three of the 82 respondents said they had lost orders because they could not afford the cost of adopting the standard, which many of their customers now expect them to meet. Seventy eight per cent of respondents said they dealt with customers which had registered for BS5750 or that they had been sent questionnaires by customers inquiring about their quality controls. The federation wants a mini-BS5750 tailored to the needs of the smallest of small companies and costing much less to implement than the present standard. \"It is ridiculous to expect businesses with turnover of less than Â£100,000 to pay thousands of pounds for certification when the quality of their product is not in doubt,\" says Bill Knox, federation chairman.

   "text_content" : "In the third article of a series looking at public spending on research and development throughout the world, Stefan Wagstyl examines why Japan's state-funded sector lags so far behind its commercial counterpart Researchers at Tokyo university are crowded into crumb- ling buildings sur- rounded by unkempt grounds littered with piles of rubbish. There is so little room that some scientists conduct their experiments in the corridors. It is hard to believe that this is Japan's most prestigious seat of learning - that a nation which values technol- ogy so highly can show so little respect for the scientific research which makes techno- logical advance possible. Japan's total research and development spending is the highest in the world as a pro- portion of national output (2.9 per cent of gross national prod- uct). But the poverty of state- funded Tokyo university is a startling example of how little the government contributes to the total. The public R&D budget amounts to just 0.5 per cent of GNP, compared with about 1 per cent for other industria- lised countries. Moreover, Japanese scien- tists argue that their govern- ment's contribution to the advance of science is even smaller than the figures sug- gest. They say money is wasted because it is divided between too many ministries and too many research centres, includ- ing more than 400.universities. Given Japan's economic suc- cess, it is tempting to conclude that the level of government- funded R&D is irrelevant to the development of technological- ly-advanced industries. But that argument ignores the extent to which Japan has borrowed wholesale from the scientific research of other countries, much of it done in state-funded universities. Tran- sistors, semiconductors, and lasers - virtually all the prod- ucts on which the success of the world-beating Japanese electronics industry is based - come from discoveries made in western laboratories. Also,very lit- tie of Japan's R&D budget goes into defence - in sharp contrast to the US and the UK. But Japan benefits from western defence tech- nology - both in the products it buys and in the products used by US forces stationed in Japan. The Japanese themselves recognise that since their nation is now a world-class economic power they must in future share the cost of advan- cing the frontiers of science. To achieve this, Japan will have to put more resources into basic science as well as con tinuing to invest in applied sci entific research. The question is how? Will the public contribution to R&D he increased or will companies have to shoulder most of the burden themselves? If the recent past is any guide, companies are likely to expand basic research more quickly than the government. In the past decade, total research spending has doubled; in the year to March 1990, It is hard to believe that Japan shows so little respect for scientific research spenuing amounrte 1o Y14,000bn (61bn). But total research spending has risen so fast that the proportion of basic research has fallen from about 20 per cent to less than is per cent. This decline has gone hand n hand with the steady eclipse of governmenit R&D spending, which has fallen as a share of the national total from about 30 per cent in 1980 to less than 20 per c\"nt. Leading companies pride themselyes in the investments made in pure researcn - some 200 .cor- porate funda- Sental rsearch labo- -atories have opened in the past 10 years. Anorn them advanced research laboratory, a gleam- ing white building set in green hills north of Tokyo, and home to Akira Tonomura, world-re- nowned for work with electron microscopes. \"We have to make our con- tribution to science,\" says Ton- omura, citong Bell Laboratories of the US as an example of a corporate research centre with a record of excellence which most universities would envy. But other scientists doubt whether Japan can rely on commercial laboratories alone to advance into fundamental research. Junichi Nishizawa, president of Tohoku university in northern Japan and widely- known as the father of the Jap- anese semiconductor industry, says fundamental research has to be done in universities or in non-profit institutions. \"For a Japanese company *Private 4M e,^ 42.o1por% 42.1% > ^ < Private *flpntons doing something which would not contribute to profits would be to betray the company,\" says Nishizawa. \"The purpose of all these corporate laborato- ries is to attract good gradu- ates into the company. They are allowed to work in the lab- oratories for a while then are sent to factories.\" Nishizawa says Tonomura, an acknowledged potential Nobel prize winner, is an exception. Other scientists in commercial laboratories have much less freedom. Shojiro Asai, the head of the Tonomu- ra's laboratory at Hitachi, acknowledges the force of I Nishizawa's point. He says it z would be difficult to secure i funds for a project which had . no commercial potential for Hitachi. Nevertheless, he insists his scientists have great scope for developing their ideas, not to mention the provision of first-class facil- ities. However, whatever the shortcomings of corporate lab- oratories, Japanese scientists agree these pale in comparison with the problems in the public sector. They believe the public bud- get is badly under-funded - a result of the fact that in the immediate post-war years Japan could not afford the lux- ury of scientific research. The Ministry of Finance's insis- tence on balanced national budgets makes it difficult to expand the R&D budget with- out cutting other spending. Within these constraints, the government has managed to secure funds for large-scale projects with a strong eco- nomic purpose - such as the country's nuclear power pro- gramme. It has even found money for expensive funda- mental research schemes, Icluding a Yll0bn (Â£480m) synchrotron, a 1.5km-long mnachine which will be the big- gest in the world when it is iaished in 1998, and which will be used in the production of semiconductors. *Scientists say much money is wasted by dividing funds among too many recipients. The Ministry of Education gets the largest share, 45 per cent, followed by 25 per cent for the Science and Technology minis- try and 10 per cent for the Min- istry of International Trade nad Industry. The Ministry of Education cannot target projects because Itis obliged to distribute funds among some 400 universities. To make matters worse, profes- hors rule their departments like fiefdoms so it is difficult for young scientists to secure adequate research funds. The result, with some excep- tions, is atrophy. Susumu Tonegawa, winner of the 1987 Nobel prize for medi- cine for work done in the US, once said he could never have won his award if he had stayed in Tlran To be fair, government offi- cials are trying to deal with the problem by developing new national institutes, in order to skirt around traditional univer- sity pecking orders, such as Tokyo university's Institute for Advanced Technology set up in 1988. But young researchers find it hard to join such an institute before they obtain a doctorate - since doctorates can only be awarded at a university. Also, the independent institutes face the same difficulties securing money as other public research bodies. One solution is to appeal to industry for funds - as hap- pened with the recent estab- lishment of the International Institute for Research into High-Temperature Supercon- ductivity, staffed by scientists from the public and private Scientists argue that the government's contribution to R&D is even smaller than the figures suggest sectors but supported mostly by corporate money. The most ambitious scheme is the Science and Technology Agency's programme for Exploratory Research for Advanced Technologies (Erato) which has sponsored 16 pro- jects since 1981. Erato cuts across traditional lines, picking out individual. scientists and alloting funds : for about five years to remove financial pressures. The researchers include scientists in public and in private organisations, including both Tonomura and Nishizawa. The emphasis is on laboratory rather than theoretical work since laboratory research requires the biggest funds. Nishizawa supports the Erato programme. But in gen- i eral he says there is too little evaluation of the relative mer- its of projects. \"There is no proper assessment. Everybody is levelled down by the ack of money. 'irst we should find' some peoplel skilled at eval-r uating scien-j ific projects, hen we should double the budget.\" But Nishizawa doubts whether his prescription will ever be adopted since it would require the complete reform of the educational establishment. Too many people would have too much to lose. It is likely that while the quality of Japan's publicly- funded research programme will improve at the margins due to projects like Erato, there is little prospect of the transformation of universities into genuine centres of scien- tific excellence. The scientists at Tokyo university may have to work in the corridors for a long time to come. The series will continue next Tuesday with an article on research and development in the UK.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Cane Ss any doubts remain about the power of the \"open systems movement\", today's announcements from international Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, should dispel them. Open systems are computers which obey common industry standards so that machines from different makers can be connected together and use software from different manu- facturers. Such systems offer lower costs to users but narrower margins to manufacturers. So many makers prefer to stay with proprietary designs - systems which are not compat- ible with those of other makers and so lock customers into buying equipment from just one company. IBM is launching a small version of its medium-sized AS/ 400 family of computers. Bur- dled in with the announcement is a pair of \"statements of direction\" which suggest that the last bastions of proprietary design are at last collapsing. Statements of direction in IBM-speak indicate commit-, mients to developments on which customers can rely for future planning. IBM's state- ments commits it to AS/400 machines which comply with TECHNICALLY SPEAKING the Posix operating system and run Cics (Customer Informa- tion Control System) on AS/400 computers. This means that AS/400 joins IBM's mainframe and personal computer families in at least the appearance of \"openness\" - compatibility with other makers' equipment. Posix is a set of rules approved by the Institute of Electrical and Elec- tronic Engineers which ensures that software written to Posix rules will run on a Posix computer. With the acceptance of Posix the AS/400 family, hitherto proprietary, puts a foot in the open camp. Today's announcements also mean that the AS/400 range looks like being IBM's main computer range for the future. Cics is a transaction process- ing monitor, so far available only on mainframes. Its avail- ability on AS/400 suggests a broadening role for the mid- range family in IBM's strategy. In past years, IBM has been plagued by a plethora of differ- ent product families each with its own operating system. Digi- tal Equipment profited in the 1980s from this; its Vax range used the same VMS operating system for all machines. Success in the mid-range is critical. Some 30 per cent of IBM's income is derived from mid-range sales while revenues from PCs and mainframes are stagnant or declining. With the introduction of the low end AS/400, the range stretches from a system cost- ing Â£7,142 and with capacity for four users to one with the power of a small mainframe. The aim is to increase the power of the dual processor machine at the top of the range by adding more processors. Computer enthusiasts will remember that the AS/400 grew out of the System/38 which in turn was derived from the principles developed in IBM's Future Series, which was aborted in the 1970s to the fury of IBM's top technologists. In the new style AS/400 fam- ily with added openness, it looks increasingly if Future Series has come home to roost.",

   "text_content" : "USuM HALL, The music at this year's Edinburgh Festival ended with its heart In Eastern Europe, as it has so often been over the last few years. The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra completed Its visit with a pair of concerts that were Slgeniously planned to look upon the legacy of music in its home country, either from one angle or another. As the orchestra's opening concert with Mackerras had been outstanding in almost every respect, It seemed worthwhile to stay on and see what it would make of these other two programmes under its Principal Conductor, Jifi BloblAvek. This is basically a good orchestra. The quality and sweetness of its strings, i in particular, afforded pleasure over each of the three evenings; but the special distinction of that first concert was not repeated. The differences were at once nothing much and everything that mattered. The razor-sharp rhythmic attack that clipped ensemble to the quick had lost its edge; an orchestral sound that had been fabulously slim-line had now put on weight and exhibited an average girth. The pleasure of these last two concerts came not so much from being excited by an orchestra driven to the peak of its powers as from * sensing the players drawing on years of musical tradition and understanding. When Mackerras conducted Dvoftk, - for all his other virtues he had never quite made the rhythms lilt and the colours glow with native ease. B61ohlavek and his musicians have the music in their blood and their performances alike of the Fifth Symphony and the Op.46 Slavonic Dances gave us Dvotik inflected with his home accent. In Friday's programme a performance of Beethoven's Triple Concerto by the Israel Piano Trio, playing with a chamber music sensitivity too modest to carry in this music and in this hall, stepped outside Czech boundaries. Otherwise the national connections were diligently , followed, even when it came to the Mozart items of the second concert. The Overture to Don SGiovannim premiered in Prague in 1787, began slackly, but gained in spirit for the main Allegro. Ensemble was also scrappy in the majestic slow introduction to the \"Prague\" Symphony, although some buoyant playing in the fast outer movements made amends. Even so, the fire of Scottish Opera's La clemensa di Tito two nights before still burnt upon the memory and this Mozart was nothing to compare. Then the various strands of the Czech theme were brought together in Petr Eben's Prague Nocturnes (Hommdge a W.A.M.). The D Smajor tonality and scoring of the \"Prague\" Symphony provide a starting-point for Eben in his Mozart tribute. SThere are only a couple of direct quotations and those -of passing importance; for the rest this piece proceeds as a free composition. It is difficult to place Eben's music exactly, despite a debt to Mahler in * its yearningly expressive string writing, but its mood and style fitted well enough. In Edinburgh almost any new music deserves an automatic R welcome. S Richard Fairman"

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0903_0015_004",
   "text_content" : "WT yre I comnpiling a Sguidebook to W underrated towns, Namurl in southern Belgium would mate three stars. I like Namur's 18th-century brick houses, its onion belfries and the pompous statues oh the bridges acrss' the Sambre and the Meuse. More dubiously, there is a museum dedicated to the art- cum-soft-porn of FAicien Rope, a son of Namur. All of which merits one star and two if you are remotely interested in mill- tary history and walk the forti- fications on the lofty citadel Why, then, a third star? Because Namur boasts the unforgettable Treasure of the Priory of Olgnies. The Treasure is an exquisite Gothic hoard guarded ,by friendly black and-white drag- ons, the Sisters of Our Lady. You must ring the bell of the modern convent at 17, Rue Julie Billiart. A nun will then conduct you to a strong-room filled with a mass of dazzling crosses, chalices, and reli- quaries, many of them master- pieces of the goldsmith's art. Twice I have heard the nuns tell the story of their cherished windfall and both times found myself moved by their evident devotion to the memory of its principal creator, Brother Hugo of Oignies. Hugo of Oignies was one of four upper-class brothers who, obeying an impulse which was quite common among knightly families in the 12th century, all decided to enter the religious life. They used their inheri- tance to found a priory at Oig- nies on the banks of the Sambre. Three brothers became priests but Hugo did not. Perhaps he had no inclina- tion for preaching and the care of souls, or perhaps it was understood that his talent lay elsewhere. Hugo's portrait is on the sill ver cover of the gospel-book he both wrote and for which he made the fabulous binding. Around the central crucifixion, with its ruby sun and pearl moon, runs a memorable inscription. \"Hugo wrote this book with much trouble. Pray for him. Others sing to Christ with their voice, Hugo sings to him with his goldsmith's art.\" From the early middle ages, the Meuse region was famous for its workshops of metal- workers. Most are anonymous, but Hugo Joins Reginald of Huy and Nicholas of Verdun as masters of their art. Hugo belongs to the final phase when the French Gothic style strongly influenced the grace- ful way in which the human form was represented. It is shown at its best in Hugo's Virgin and Child incised on a large phylactery of St Martin, the largest of five of these remarkably ornate cases for relics. The closer one peers, the more marvellous appears Hugo's technical mastery. He perfected the use of filigree, soldering tiny seeds of gold to create delicate mounts for gem- stones, and also niello which allowed for delicate pictures of silver on black. Hugo deco- rated his pieces with patterns of running vine-leaves, with paired dragons, rabbits, and on the foot of the superb chalice he made for his elder brother, Prior Giles, little huntsmen running through a meadow. Of course they could always be explained as be symbolic, per- haps of the soul searching for God, but perhaps Hugo also loved the simple pleasures of life. If Hugo himself is a shadowy figure, the Treasur.Yvidbly recalls a well-known 1b- i- tury individual, Jacques do Vitry. A Parisian by birth, Jc- ques spent some years at 1Og- fies. Like other devout per- sons, he had been attracted to this modest place by the fame :of the local saint, a mystic -called Mare. (On the saint's deathbed he piously cut off her finger for which Hugo made an elegant little container, both now in the Royal Museum in Brussels.) Jacques himself was eventu- ally to be buried at Olgnies, but only after a long career reaching against the wretched Cathar heretics in the south of France and as a bishop in the Holy Land. Here, as historians know from the bishop's pep pery sermons, the pressing problem was to stop the Euro- pean settlers \"going native\", softened by the heat and the long hours spent Arab-style in bath-houses. Jacques also used his east mrn posting to collect holy rel- ics such as St Peter's rib, St James's foot, and the Virgin's milk. (This was a chalky deposit which pilgrims used to buy at the grotto in Bethle hem.) He sent many relics to Olinies, some in ivory boxes miade by Arab craftsmen which are still in the Treasure. Hugo made reliquaries for these gifts, using jewels and Roman intaglios his patron may also have sent. A superb reliquary shaped like a crescent moon contains the Prince of the Apostle's rib. Hugo may alsc- have made the dove, a charac terful looking bird with a large amethyst on its breast for the precious drops of the Virgin's milk. Jacques bequeathed a little triptych of saints' images, very rough in comparison with Hugo's work, and his little altar for celebrating mass on thei move. The exquisite cross e' kept in his private chapel is studded with Byzantine enam- els, perhaps bought in Con- stantinople on his way out east. Someone else less skilled than Hugo made the two foot- shaped reliquaries and the strange one shaped like a Jaw which holds that same portion o St Bartholomew. After the 14th century, the community on the Sambre entered a long decline and yet, remarkably, the prodigious reasure stayed largely intact. Durhig the French Revolution, ihe monks scattered and the prior took the Treasure to a farmer who walled it up in his house. In 1817 the prior went to reclaim it and found the farmer was dead but his widow, although in dire sinan- cial straits, had preserved the Treasure. The prior gave the Treasure to the Sisters of Our Lady of Namur, a teaching order recently established in the town. It is pleasant to hear that the nuns also took in the stout-hearted widow. And so the Treasure stayed hidden from sight and exhib- ited on very rare occasions in the latter part of the last cen- tury, as Belgium began to take a great pride in her magnifi- cent medieval heritage. In 1940, the Germans destroyed the convent but could not find the Treasure which had been bur- ied on the outbreak of the war. In recent years the Treasure's fame has grown since it was designated one of \"the Seven Marvels of Belgium\". And so indeed it is, one not to miss. The treasure is open from 10 to 12 and for 2 to 5 every day except Sunday mornings, Tues- days, and religious festivals (010 32 81-22-15-02).

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-03",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0903_0015_005",
   "text_content" : "February 29 next year brings Rossini's bicentenary. Pesaro, his birthplace, has already produced such rarities as Demetrio e Polibio, Bianca e Falliero, Ermione, and Ricciardo e Zoraide at its annual Rossini Festival. This year, the big operas were more familiar: a revival of the 1988 Otello, and Tancredi restaged, with horses, in the city's sports palace. La cambiale di matri- monio, the opera that launched the 18- year-old Rossini's career, was done on a double bill with Mozart's first dramatic score, Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots, composed when he was ten. And there was a second instalment of Bourbon cantatas that Rossini wrote in Naples: those for Ferdinand IV's birthday in 1816, for the King's first visit to the San Carlo after a recovery from illness, in 1819, and for the Austrian Emperor's first visit to the thea- tre three months later. These occasional cantatas, lasting each about 20 minutes, were grand allegorical affairs, with settings and transformation scenes, choruses and ballets, and Isabella Colbran (the King's favourite, later Ros- sini's wife) as prima donna. In 1819, the stage band alone numbered 120. The Pesaro concert performances were but sketches of what they must have been. A small chorus (the Prague Philharmonic) and small orchestra (part of RAI Turin) were conducted without grandeur or grace by Gabriele Ferro. Cecilia Bartoli, billed for the Colbran roles, fell ill, and her place was taken by three brave but not espe- cially impressive young singers. The birthday cantata was the best of the three. It survives complete, in the New York Public Library; the two others needed much reconstruction by their edi- tors. A chorus and a set of tripping, trivial dance variations are common to both; the manuscript of the \"Franz\" cantata peters out on an instruction to repeat the chorus of the previous cantata, followed by a Tyrolean ballet and the earlier ballabile, and finally, as an illuminated effigy of the Emperor appeared, la musica Genmanica. enough The bill was completed by Ros- sini's student cantata I piamto d'Armonia sulla mortes d Orfeo, for tenor and male chorus, written when he was 16 - a thor- Bruce Ford in 'Schuldigkeit' oughly composed, carefully scored, and excellent composition. Rockwell Blake, flu- ent, but unengaging of tone, was the solo- ist. I had not heard the Schuldigkeit since the last Mozart bicentenary, in 1956. It hardly merits frequent revival: the arias are long, repetitive, and rather dull until things perk up at the entry of Worldliness. Giovanni Agostinucci had designed an elaborate white-and-gold rococo tableau, with billowing clouds and allegorical stat- ues of the \"characters\" - Divine Justice, Divine Mercy, and the Christian Spirit - who as singers then came down to rouse an idle Christian. Mozart wrote only the first of three acts, which ends with Chris- tian going off, at Worldliness's invitation, to a jolly party while Justice, Mercy, and the Christian Spirit debate the outcome. There is no drama, no action. Luigi Squarzina, the producer, added a poeS of supers to the prelude, and provided each allegorical figure with a cute little tot of a page. A concert performance might better serve a score whose main interest lies in hearing young Mozart, fresh from travels on which he had met Jommelli and J.C.Bach, try his wings in a first extended flight. Decent singing: Jeannette Fischer was a lively Worldliness, Bruce Ford a vocally adept Christian Spirit (but a stage booby), and Ramon Vargas a winning Christian with an attractive, individual timbre. The five one-act comedies that young Rossini composed for the San Moisb are felicitous, captvating, musically inven- .tive, whoVy delghtful, and in Pesaro La camWbalethest of them, surived, just, SSquarlna'sjkwful production. In placeof character, wit, and charm of timbre and utterance, we had nonstop business and busyness, enacted by car toon-strip figures dressed in loud tartans and forever fussing with props; the Lon- don merchant,. Tobias Mill - the buffo father who, t the young lovers outwit - became a Shylock in yarmelke and tallith. Enzo Dara sang the role with excellent clarity. Soeun Jeun was a pretty Fanny, though she had not mastered a dozen dif- ferently fascinating, piquant ways of say- ing the word \"ma\". Roberto Frontali was a nicely direct Slook, the Canadian mer- chant. Donato Renzetti in both the Mozart and the Rossini was a neat but rather metronomic, unyielding conductor. Meanwhile, at the Accademia Rossi- niana, Will Crutchfield was teaching young singers how to take charge of Ros- sini's music, to improvise, to do something astonishing and unrehearsed at each dif- ferent performance. How would they and a conductor like Renzetti get on? Pesaro serves Rossini well in many different ways, but I have yet to hear and see a performance there in which all the excit- ing research into matters textual, vocal, instrumental, and scenic is brought together in one satisfactory whole. Singers learn to embeaish tylishlyproducers and dsiner d to \"embefllsh\" unstylOsbiy. Sways obscure and corrupt lhe plain sense of th-ork. But maybe in 1992... A'drew Porter",

   "text_content" : "QUMEN IUZAETH HALL The centrepoint of the current \"Mozart Now\" series on South Bank was filled with two days devoted to the examination and celebration of Mozart's final year of life. It was hosted by the conductor Roger Nor- rington and his London Classi- cal Players, and planned along the lines of those \"Experience\" weekends (Mozart, Berlioz, Beethoven) which over the past few years have provided London concert life with pecu- liar illumination on their ho-& sen subject-composers. ; : The difference, this time, was that Saturday's and Sun- day's talks, demonstrations and concerts proper were devoted to what Norrington with his customary genial wit described as \"camera-crew activity\" - to following Mozart through the days and months of that last extraordinary year, exploding some of the more clingingly sentimental myths along the way and holding the various 1791 works up to fresh light in the process. It was an enticing notion. Not all the daytime sessions I attended lived up to its prom- ise; some of the talks came off as boring factual plods or else were boringly delivered (a ses- sion on dance and theatre in Mozart's day, potentially of huge value, was killed by limp delivery and incompetent slide projection). The glue holding the scheme together was Nor- rington's own personality, his light touch as master o-cere- monies, and - most of all - his and the Players' perfor- mances. The Saturday evening con- cert presented the two 1791 concertos, K596 for piano (Mel- vyn Tan) and K622 for clarinet (Colin Lawson), amiably sepa- rated by sets of the popular dances that Mozart also com- posed that year. In the after- noon there had been an ear- nest defence of the musical quality of those dances; and since here they served as accompaniments to the real thing - danced by a capable (if rather too decorous) octet from the Early Dance Project - the point was made both enjoyably -and wenl. A feature of these Norring- ton outings is the testing-out in practice of the latest notions in musicological research. The fining-down of certain string passages in the piano concerto to front desks only - a lovely chamber-musical effect that chimed well with the intimate character of Tan's fortepiano playing - was one of these. The performance of the concert aria for bass voice (Alastair Miles) and double bass, K612, was another, and rather less successful, since the player of the violone (a \"period\" double bass) seemed quite unable to deliver his passages of virtuoso knitting in tune. But the \"workshop\" style of the evening concerts - a con- ceit that the conductor carried off elegantly - tended to dis- arm criticism of any passing flaws. And on Sunday, with the Schitz Choir and four fine singers (Nancy Argenta, Cath- erine Robbin, John Mark Ain- sley, Mr Miles) in attendance, the revisiting of the big vocal masterpieces, via excerpts from the operas Magic Flute and Thus plus the extant parts of the Requiem, was carried off with considerable grace and flair. Though he may still move an Andante along at a faster lick than traditionalists might want him to, Norrington is no longer a rigid, bandmas- terly Mozartian. The performances were all beautifully \"breathed\", by con- ductor as well as singers, excit- ingly vital but also lyrical. Thus, another point previously asserted - that the works of 1791 are the vgoroius prducts of a living composer, and not Romantic progress-reports of his impending death '- 'was also well made in practice. If rumours of Norrington's own current ill-health and retire- ment (temporary, let us hope) from the musical scene are true, this concert alone will stand as a proud and satisfying farewell achievement. Max Loppert Rolling Rock backs four jazz tours Rolling Rock, the American bottled beer, will sponsor the four jazz tours on the 1991/92 season of the Arts Council's Contemporary Music Network. All four feature American musicians. The concerts, to be known as The RoUlling Rock J=as Tors, are by the Mike Gibbs Band with John Scofield (October 9-21); Monty Alexander's Ivory and Steel (November 6-15); Geri Allen, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian supported by the Louis Sclavis Quartet (November 21-29) and Henry Threadgill's Very Very Circus, suppported by Orphy Robinson's Anavas (January W February 5)."

   "text_content" : "DESPITE the succession of accounting scandals that has scarred. the commercial land- scape in Britain over the past two decades, the debate on accounting practice has been striking for the lack of heavy- weight contributions from those whose interests are most directly involved: the invest- ment institutions. Now it turns out that they were simply too polite to chip in. A call from Mr David Tweedie of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) for the users of company accounts to express their con- cerns has elicited an uncharac- teristically powerful - and welcome - response. Not only have the Associa- tion of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPS) sent in their respective shopping lists; individual institutions have also put in their oar, alongside the Confederation of British Industry and the usual panoply of accountancy insti- tutions and firms. That sug- gests that the new standard- setting process, which enjoys enhanced independence and legal powers, may turn out to be rather less beholden to the producer cartel of the accoun- tancy world than it was under the guise of the old Accounting Standards Committee. What a pity this bandwagon took so long to gather impetus. Conspicuous loopholes In the main the institutions' concerns relate to the more conspicuous loopholes of the last stock market boom. Off- balance sheet financing, acqui- sition accounting, the non-re- mittability of profits of foreign subsidiaries are among the more prominent. Yet the extent of institutional disillu- sionment with standards of auditing and accounting prac- tice has led to some radical demands - most notably a request from the NAPS for a new, tough reporting format similar to that used in 10K reports for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Accounting Standards Board has already moved to address some of the problems. A definitive rule on off-balance sheet items will probably be ready in November, as will a rule on cash. flow statements, subject to further deliberations on the remittance of profits in the light of institutional con- cern. The ASB also hopes that the call for an American-style reporting format will partly be satisfied by the refinement of its relatively tough draft rules, published in April, dealing with abuses of the profit and loss account, and by forthcom- ing proposals requiring more interpretative discussion of profits by management. Early days It is too early to pass any judgment on the likely effec- tiveness of the new standard- setting process. And there are other areas for the institutions to address, not least the poten- tial conflict of interest inherent in auditors carrying out more lucrative consultancy work for their clients, which is begin- ning to worry the NAPS. Nor is that conflict relevant only to the auditor. The management of at least one leading British insurer recently appeared to demonstrate a greater anxiety to reduce its own audit costs than to reassure shareholders and beneficiaries as to the integrity of its accounts. A more active institutional stance in these matters none- theless suggests that accoun- tancy's new regulatory regime is off to a promising start. Yet sound accounting and auditing will never be a substitute for good investment judgment. Some fund managers were capable of detecting a smell in the accounts of Polly Peck; too many were not. An educational task has still to be fully addressed in the institutions' own back yard."

   "text_content" : "CHINA cannot be ignored. Whether the issue is political, regional, humanitarian, com- mercial or connected with international security, China has' to be considered. But whatever the realpolitik, there remains the question of how best to handle one of the world's least pleasant and least co-operative regimes. Is it only to be on China's own terms? John Major is not the first leader of a large industrialised nation to go to Beijing since the Tiananmen Square massa- cre two years ago. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's prime minister, beat him there by a month and he is about to be followed by Mr Andreotti of Italy. Nor is Britain the first nation to do a recent deal with China, as it has done over the Hong Kong airport project. President Bush fought for, and narrowly won, extension of most favoured nation trading status for China this summer. The case for Mr Major's visit is that without his personal imprimatur, the airport deal would not have been done and that Hong Kong would have suffered as a result. The reality is that neither Britain nor the US can stop China doing what it wants with Hong Kong. The hope is, as Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, put it over the weekend, that the Chinese come to see that it is in their own self-interest to preserve the economic vitality of Hong Kong, and human rights there, into the next century. This sense extends beyond the current geographical con- fines of Hong Kong itself. If real political and economic change comes to China with the passing of its present ger- ontocracy and acolytes, it will be because the reform move- ment has been preserved inde China. It currently thrives, albeit under controlled condi- tions, in southern China, nota- bly in the special economic zone of Shenzhen, itself domi- nated by Hong Kong commer- cial interests. It is greatly in the interests of Hong Kong, Britain, China and the rest of the world interest that this process of economic liberalisa- tion should continue. The regime in Beijing, how- ever, makes it hard for support to be freely forthcoming. China has its own international agenda, not necessarily con- sistent with any consensus of international interests. Its human rights record is appall- ing, from Tibet to Tiananmen and beyond; it sells arms to the world's most inflammatory regions; it underpins and underwrites some indefensible regimes, such as Burma's. There are always tantalising hints of change - not blocking the United Nations role in the Gulf conflict, a possible moder- ating hand on North Korea, accepting the nuclear non-pro- liferation treaty - but these are ounces on one side of a scale outweighed by pounds on the other. Mr Major's trip, like Mr Kaifu's, was always intended by Beijing to be a golden gift for the regime's propagandists. If he has a message for the Chinese people, they will not know it, except by short-wave radio. They will be told, directly, only that his-resence endorses current polieis. If Mr Major connived at restrictions on his freedom to speak openly daring his visit, it is to be regretted. It can hardly have escaped the prime minister that to be seen in the streets of Moscow as the iMend of he- dom is pleasant; to be seen as such in the streets ofat eingls risky, but important.",

MIe apan Festival will probably trtthousands of British people to Even though the British are more cosmopolitan than they were, Japa- nese culture seems st uite alien. We are happy wearing Italian shoes, eating French food, drinking Mexican beer, gazing at Australian soap opera and watching American feature films. By contrast, Japanese culture has made few inroads into our lives. Yet our experience of the world is increasingly being delivered by the Japanese. We can listen to crystal clear classical music thanksy to their portable compact disc players. We can curl up on our settees to watch films whenever we like, thanks to their video recorders, which play through their large, flat-screen televisions. We can record and replay vital moments in our family histories thanks to their lightweight video camcorders. The products of Japanese consumer electronics companies have spread around the world by giving us increasingly cheap and compact ways to control and choose what sounds and images we perceive. Most British living rooms contain some Japanese technology. For some people, eve- nings and weekends would be unimaginable without it. The commercial success of Japa- nese consumer electronics has raised pressing economic and industrial questions for the west. How should trade deficits with Japan be reduced? How should western electronics com- panies respond to the competitive threat they face? Yet the growing dependence of much of our lives upon Japanese tech- nology also raises an intriguing social question. While using these products, are we also imbibing Japanese pat. terns of behaviour and values? How are our social lives and values being changed by them? After all when the global economic power of Britain and the US was unchallenged, they exported their val- ues - the British legal system and the American dream of mass consum- erism - as part of the package. Is it conceivable that Japan could be the most dynamic economy in the world, making products which fill our facto- ries, roads and living rooms, without having some impact on our values? At first sight it seems possible that Japan could be economically powerful and yet culturally passive. After all, it is not as if the Japanese invented consumer electronics. Most of the important consumer electronics inventions - the video-cassette recorder and the compact disc - have come from Europe and the US. The Japanese have been adept at manufac- turing these products but they did not start the revolution. Nor does consumer electronics hardware serve as a platform for the spread of indigenous Japanese cul- ture; it is largely just a delivery mech- anism for western music and films. If anything, the spread of Japanese tele- visions, videos and hi-fis is hastening the spread of US culture. This inter- dependence of Japanese hardware and western \"software\" - industry jargon for films, music and other electroni- cally-transmitted entertainment - was confirmed by Sony's purchase of Columbia Pictures and CBS Records and Matsushita's acquisition of MCA, the entertainment group. Moreover, by western yardsticks Japan may seem culturally inhibited. Europeans and North Americans are often so transfixed by the scale of Japan's economic success that they do not notice there are some things the Japanese seem to do badly. Aside from a handful of leading clothes designers the Japanese show relatively little interest in the style of public exteriors. The architecture of I \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t most Japanese cities and villages Is usually dull and often ugly, in large part because of the lack of space and the headlong pace of building dictated by post-war industrialisation. Whereas Paris has the moderrn grandeur of La Defense and London attracts people because of its historic buildings and parks, the Japanese have only the most limited public spaces in which to gather. Apart from watching baseball, the main public, cultural activity is shopping, carried out with a zeal which can stun even the most dedicated European con- sumer. But these measures do not tell the whole story. For Japanese consumer electronics products, and the indus- tries that produce them, have a cul tural power of their own. Subtly, and in ways we may not notice, they are changing our lives. It may be that there is nothing intrinsically Japanese about all this. The growth of consumer electronics is, after all, just another stage in the process of industrialisation, as new generations of cheaper and more sophisticated products replace older vintages of more expensive and less reliable ones. But this seems unlikely. For a vari- ety of reasons - some of them cul- tural - the Japanese are particularly well-equipped to exploit to the full the technological and social revolution made possible by microelectronics. Thney may help to explain why Japa- nese electronic products may spread Japanese values even if we use them to see and listen to western culture. First, the Japanese seem far more interested in the quality of interiors rather than the style and look of exte- riors. So Roppongi, the club and bar district of Tokyo, is full of nondescript multi-storey buildings which you could mistake for dull office blocks were it not for signs alerting you to lavish bars, restaurants and clubs on upper and basement floors. The out- ward signs are as partial a guide to the inner workings of such places as a keyboard is a guide to the semicon- ductors at work inside a computer. You have to look inside, into interi- ors, to find the Japanese impact on us In future, the line between the real and the electronic will probably blur further, to the extent that it may not be fully recognisable rather than looking at exteriors. Second, with space at a premium, products have to be slim and compact. The fastidious sense of detail and neatness which Japanese managers display on production lines or in the design of miniaturised products is in part management philosophy, in part an everyday pattern of behaviour. Third, the Japanese have a different attitude towards consumption, accord- ing to Mr Masatoshi Naito, head of design at Matsushita, the electronics group. Mr Naito says of the televi- sions and hi-fis his group makes: \"You in the west think of these prod- * r * 1r I 1 1 ucts as consumer durables, things which last. For you consumption is an act which you undertake in bursts, periodically. Japanese consumption is a continuous cycle of new products replacing old products, everything is n a process of change, nothing endures. We do not seek perma- nence.\" This attitude makes Japan particularly well-suited to the fast- moving world of electronics with new products rolling off production lines n quick succession. Fourth, it follows from the relative lack of interest in permanent, public exteriors that Japanese product designers show no interest in creating monuments to ideologies or values. This is in stark contrast to western designers such As Raymond Loewy, he creator of such consumer icons as he Coca-Cola bottle, and architects :uch as Le Corbusier who had ambi- ious visions of modern worlds fit for nodern people to live; in. The Japanese are much more inter- ested in designing products that fit nto people's lives. . Mr Kenji Ekuan, he president of GK Industrial Designs who is widely regarded as the ather of Japanese industrial design, says: \"In the west you have designers as crusaders, moral heroes who attempt to impose their values hrough their designs. Here we want o make tools which people can use. We start from how people live now, ather than from a vision of how they should live. We create tools which can always be improved to do their jobs more effectively to meet people's needs.\" Perhaps the most profound effect that Japanese technology is havingon western ways of viewing the world is in the way it constantly blurs the line between the real world and the world created by electronics. Electronics products are tools to reshape our experience, to give us ever greater choices about what we experience and when. The most recent example is the worldwide rise of the lightweight, hand-held camcorder. As a result real world experience - weddings, birthdays and holidays - can be recorded and replayed at will Experience becomes a malleable, elec- tronically-generated image. The Japanese seem more willing to step over or simply disregard this line between the real and the electronic. This is a more widespread and argu- ably a more profound revolution in the way we see the world than all the temples of architectural modernism. A few thousand people will each day see the Lloyd's building, London's most famous modernist building; mil- lions each day rely of Japanese tech- nology to deliver to them sights and sounds. The Japanese are not altering the way we see the real world, they are doing something far more radical. They are taking us further and fur- ther into a different world of elec- tronic images and sounds. Having opened up this virgin terri- tory of the electronic world and encouraged us to take our first steps into it, the Japanese are determined constantly to expand its frontiers. Having applied microelectronic tech- nology to places - particularly our living rooms - they are now applying it to people. Microelectronics is going mobile. If you frisked the average Japanese businessman you would find his pock- ets and briefcase stuffed with technol- ogy - a portable compact disc player, pager, lap-top computer, electronic diary, miniature tape recorder, tiny television, the list goes on. Things you could previously only do in a single place - write a memo, call a customer, listen to a symphony - can now be done on the move. You do not have to go back to your home or the office to have access to the electronic world: it can travel with you, you can plug into it wherever you are. In future, the line between the real and the electronic will probably blur even further to the extent that it may not be fully recognisable. This is the principle behind karaoke, the bar- room singing craze which is spreading around the world. People sing into microphones as the backing music from popular songs plays around them. People are using electronics to become what they are not, pop stars and film stars. The logical extension of the karaoke principle is virtual reality. Virtual reality machines are like flight simulators for training air- craft pilots, except they offer a much wider variety of simulated worlds, using a combination of computers and graphics generators. So far, virtual reality products exist only in prototype. But if and when they reach the shops, they could radi- cally alter the way we play - and work. Rather than coming home to watch a video recording of a western on your television, you could actually become a cowboy, strut through the dusty streets of a cowboy town, walk into a saloon and order a whisky. The images you see respond to your real world commands. This technology will create compre- hensive, all-embracing electronic real- ities for people to relax and work within. The line between the real world and the electronic world disap- pears as you submerge yourself in your chosen, virtual reality. The Japanese live in interiors made rich by a stream of electronically gen- erated information and images. They have not changed our view of the world by creating grand avenues, tow- ering cathedrals or skyscrapers. They will continue to change it by widen- ing the horizons of the new world of inner, electronic experience.",

Sir Denis is reported to have said that the root cause of lack of re-investment in the longer term by British industry \"is the cultural bias against indus- try which has long pervaded Britain\". Could the cause however be far simpler? Investment in cor- porate R&D is simply not as profitable, by normal commer- cial criteria, as other forms of company investment - in fact many companies demonstrate what an excellent way it is to lose money. The wise investor in UK company shares therefore avoids those companies which spend heavily on R&D. This is not short-termism or cultural 'bias, it is just common sense. There are of course compa- nies, particularly in the United States, Germany and Japan, which make investment in R&D pay. They do not regard .&D expenditure as an entry fee to a technological lottery. Instead, they select R&D themes, and specific projects within those themes, by com- mercial criteria. They have good information systems to monitor progress, and inte- grate technological and mar- keting management to ensure commercial success, through appropriate organisational structures. Above all, they obtain strength through collab- oration, particularly if medium or small in size. In short, they have good quality R&D management.

   "text_content" : "7ihat baa gone wrong f13 In Poland? Through Ste 1980i , its Solidar- ity tra union movement was the lone 'standard-bearer of ppi~tlon'in eastern Europe. n 1989 i became the first country t the region with a non-communist government, and later it embarked on an ambitious 'and radical pro- gramme of economic reform. Yet today Poland seems to have lost its way. Economic reform is stalled; corruption is rife; industrial unrest is rising. Making matters worse is a growing confrontation between the Sejm (parliament) and the government led by the prime minister, Mr Jan Krzysztof Bie- lecki. Decision-making is para- lysed, with the government threatening to seek special powers enabling it to bypass the legislature, and President Lech Walesa making ominous noises from the wings. How could the country have got into this mess? The main problem is a crisis of legiti- macy. Curious as it may seem, Poland is now the only state in eastern Europe which has not yet held free and democratic parliamentary - as opposed to presidential - elections. In the meantime a power vacuum has developed. Nobody is sure who is responsible for what. The uncertainty has deterred west- ern investors, slowed the pace of privatisation, and deprived the government of the mandate it needs to carry out reform. This historical quirk will be rectified on October 27, the date set for parliamentary elec- tions after protracted squabbl- ing over the election law. But the delay in holding a poll has done considerable damage to the country's quest for political and economic stability. It is easy to understand why Poland dragged its feet over holding elections. It goes back to August 1989, when after a partial Sejm and full Senate (upper house) election Solidar- ity made its historic move against the ruling communists. Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Catholic intellectual of Solidar- ity, became prime minister, but General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the prime minister's jail keeper who imposed martial law in December 1981, remained in the presidential palace. At the time it seemed a bizarre arrangement, but that was because of the outcome of the round-table negotiations between the communists and Solidarity earlier in the year. During those discussions, an \"electoral contract\" was forged in which 65 per cent of the seats in the lower house of the Sejm would be allocated to the communists and their allies, while all the seats in the Sen- ate would be freely contested in the elections that June. In the event, Solidarity easily took 99 of the 100 Senate seats. Then again, eastern Europe was a very different placi at the time - andso was the Soviet Union. The Berlin Wall was still up; Messrs Ceausescu, zhivkov, Honecker were still in power; and Soviet troops were still stationed in all the Vow- tries of central Europer Mazowlecki chose the of caution. . I But not entirely. By his \"ae was Mr Leszek Balcerowlez, the talented finance minister. Together in January 1990 they set about introducing one, of the most radical economic Oro- grammes in eastern Europe. The zloty, the unit of currency, was heavily devalued and made partially convertible, thus wiping out the black mar- ket. Inflation, which in 1989 had been running at an annual rate of 639 per cent, was soon brought down to 229 per cent. Prices were freed and trade was liberalised. The population endured the \"shock-therapy\" partly in the belief that the austerity measures would last only six months. Mr Mazo- wiecki wanted political stabil- ity so he could get on with economic reform. But when unemployment, now affecting 8.4 per cent of the labour force, began to bite, workers became restless and Mr Walesa, the leader of Soli- darity, was again catapulted on to the political scene. Mr Walesa, once a close ally of Mr Mazowiecki, openly chal- lenged the \"election contract\" on the grounds that it was allowing the communist nomenklatura to remain in power. Throughout the summer, Mr Walesa goaded the Mazowiecki government, accusing the urime minister of devoting too much attention to the economy while neglecting to purge the old guard, and calling for presi- dential elections. Mr Mazo- wiecki had no choice but to defend his economic pro- gramme, but as he fought Mr Walesa in the election cam- paign he was forced to put eco- nomic reforms on the back- burner. The prime minister was knocked out in the first round. ~,~.~~...........~...,~,*,~u~.~~...~oru~ Mr Walesa made it to the presi dential palace in the second round. But then began a two- pronged struggle as Mr Balcer- owicz attempted to put the ecc nomic reforms back on track and as Mr Walesa, separately, sought to curb the powers of the Sejm. It has been very hard going for Mr Balcerowicz. Thanks to the austerity measures, Poland was in a deep recession by May this year. Gross domestic prod- act fell 14.9 per cent in the first five months of 1991, after a fall of 13 per cent in 1990. Unem- ployment had doubled to reach 1.5m (or 8.4 per cent of the labour force). After a record 1990 budget surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP, the budget had gone into the red by the end of May, with a deficit running at about 10 per cent of GDP. As the zloty appreciated in real terms against convertible currencies, Poland's impressive export growth of last year slowed, while imports picked up. After strong surpluses in the first three quarters of 1990, Poland's current account plunged in the fourth quarter into a deficit of $1.2bn. By the end of this year, the trade defi- cit is expected to exceed $lbn. These pocket-book issues are of central importance as the campaign for the October 27 election gathers momentum; and the worsening economic picture explains the increas- ingly desperate tone being adoptd by the govqernment of Walusa erliqr this year. Mr BileTcki la faoed with three a' the s i th the vot- er; accelerate the privatisa- tion' programme - which in any case will not bring in enough revenue in time to make a aignificant impact on the budget deficit; or he could arrange interim .borrowing, perhpa from domestic banks, to buy off worker unrest. It will be difficult for Mr Walesa to remain on the side- lines during the election cam- paign. He-is likely to be torn between supporting his prime minister and Mr Balcerowicz's reform policies. In the mean- time, he will continue to chisel away at the Sejmr's authority. Mr Walesa has never liked the Seim, largely because it is dominated by former commu- nists; he has repeatedly tried to weken Its authority by tak- ing more powers for hmself or the government. But it remains unclear what the ever- mercurial Mr Walesa stands for. Because of the need for western support and foreign investment, he has stood by his finance minister. But his rhetoric betrays more than an impatience with the Sejm: it reveals a lack of faith in the present system of political accountability, as well as fear about the political fall-out from the unpopular economic reforms. \"I am angry about what I can and what I cannot do,\" he said on June 12. \"As long as there are no elections, we do not know who is responsible. I am head of the armed forces; I nominated a prime minister in your [the Sejm's] name. Every- thing is mine - and it is worse than it was before. Very often I have doubts whether evolution from the communist system is possible, or whether different methods - tough, strong, revo- lutionary methods, using fear [are needed] to re-orient the economy. I don't know yet which it will be.\" The outcome of the elections might restore Mr Walesa's trust in the parliamentary sys- tem. But it will also dictate the future direction of the coun- try's economic and political reforms. The trouble is that the poll is unlikely to produce a stable government since half a dozen parties are expected to control the Sejm and opinion polls suggest none will have an outright majority. That is pre- cisely the outcome Mr Walesa wanted to pre-empt when he was quibbling over the election law and delayed the election. But unless the democratic pro- cess can be placed back on the rails, Poland will pay a high price - both politically and economically."

   "text_content" : "By Mark Corney and Peter Robinson The confer- ence season offers an important opportunity for political, business and trade union leaders to con- firm that Britain has an endemic \"pay problem\" and that pay must be at the heart of any credible medium-term economic strategy. However, it is more likely they will take refuge in claims that Britain's primary problem is one of pro- ductivity, not pay. If the econ- omy is to perform successfully in the 1990s this argument must be rebutted. The gap between pay infla- tion (now more than 8 per cent a year) and trend productivity growth in manufacturing (4-5 per cent at best) cannot possi- bly be closed by improving pro- ductivity growth alone. Of course, additional investment in education, training, and research and development is needed, but it takes years, and in some cases a generation, to feed through. And while we wait for this to happen, there is little hope of pay growing by 4-5 per cent a year, the level needed for unit labour costs and product prices to remain roughly stable in the manufac- turing sector. Despite the depth of the recession, increases in average earnings will only fall to about 6-7 per cent. By itself exchange rate mechanism entry will fail to get pay down to internation- ally competitive levels. And if the recovery is as strong as the government hopes, upward pressure on pay might return, while any external shock to the economy could easily cause the pay-price spiral to return. Clearly, Britain's pay problem is far from licked. To solve it, Britain must quickly learn that a decentral- ised pay system cannot cope with an economy working at a satisfactory level of output growth. The problem lies in the lack of co-ordination in our decentralised pay system. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the decentralisation of pay bargaining does not make co-ordination impossible. First, we know that \"pay leadership\" where small and medium- sized companies follow larger companies in their pay-setting behaviour - exists in most industries. This implies that collective action by large employers will suffice. Second, managers of large companies still have considerable control over pay at the centre. Hence, it is a question of the will of British management, rather than their physical power, to co-ordinate pay. But there is a world of differ- ence between managers under- standing the case for co-ordina- tion and having the ability to co-ordinate, and turning this into positive action. It is the reaction of the union move- ment to co-ordinated pay bar- gaining that is making employ- ers hesitate. Employers fear that such bargaining would mean a return to a Social Con- tract of the kind attempted in the 1970s in which pay restraint was to be rewarded through lower taxes or higher public spending. This fear is unfounded. All that is being suggested is that in return for voluntary, but sustainable, increases in nominal pay, the government would be in a posi- tion to allow a sufficiently strong recovery in demand and output growth to improve the medium-term prospects of Brit- ish business. The trade-off could be wid- ened to include discussion of other economic areas of public policy, such as training, R&D and help to manufacturing industry. But this should be the limit. For the sake of Brit- ish business, employees and the growing pool of* unem- ployed people, the trade unions should endorse co-ordinated pay bargaining. In return employers should start to trust the unions again. The Campaign for Work pro- poses a five-step plan*: * First, publication of a National Economic Assessment (NEA) by an independent Council of Economic Advisers. Nominal pay rises for the com- ing year would be at the heart of the assessment, which would detail how the economy would perform under varying rates of such nominal rises. * Step two would come with the publication of the Autumn Statement, where the govern- ment spells out its plans for managing the economy and proposals for taxation and pub- lic expenditure. Central to the statement would be a target for the rate of growth in nominal demand, such that if pay increases worked out at a sus- tainable rate, there would be room for adequate output and employment growth. * In step three, a forum bring- ing together company chief executives with general secre- taries of relevant unions would discuss the NEA and the Autumn Statement with the aim of recommending a sus- tainable rate of pay increase compatible with output and employment growth. * Step four would see the syn- chronisation of other key pri- vate-sector pay settlements in January and February. * Step five concerns public sector pay and the Budget. Workers in the public sector would receive pay rises in line with average private-sector set- tlements, with due allowance given for those groups that might fall behind on pay to catch up. The Budget provides a safety valve for the govern- ment. If pay rises turned out to be excessive, a tightening of monetary and fiscal policy would follow. If the pay round went well, the government would be in a position to allo- cate additional resources to areas critical to the long-run performance of the economy. Co-ordinated pay bargaining is a contentious proposal. But without it unemployment will reach 3m - and stay there throughout the 1990s. The question for conference dele- gates this autumn is simple: is this an acceptable price to pay for not trying the alternative approach of co-ordinated pay bargaining?

   "text_content" : "By David Goodhart THE trade union movement yesterday signalled its readi- ness to accept a more codified, continental system of indus- trial relations incorporating both tight legal restrictions and positive rights for employ- ees in works councils. In a debate at the TUC con- gress in Glasgow, Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said Britain's \"eccentric labour relations set-up\" had failed. The future now lay with the continental system based on \"roundtable discussion in works councils and enterprise committees\", he said. Even the important leftwing union, MSS, which has in the past seen works councils as a threat to union organisation, supported Mr Edmonds' motion. Unions had to adapt to the continental model, it said. The first serious attempt by unions to set the industrial relations agenda for a decade came on the same day as an attack by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, on links between the Labour party and unions. Mr Howard said: \"The unions' bootprint is on every aspect of Labour policy.\" Mr Howard also criticised the decision by congress to boycott Employment Action, the scheme designed to give training and work experience to 30,000 unemployed people. In the debate on the unions and Europe, Mr Edmonds said the continental model was coming, whether people liked it or not. \"We are about to be overtaken by a revolution which will sweep away almost every feature of the British industrial relations system. Anyone who doubts the trend should buy a ticket to Brussels. They are not thinking in Brit- ish terms,\" he said. Adt d rviv ohn Edmonds said Britain's \"eccentric\" labour relations umpad failed Adant and survive: John Edmonds said Britain's \"eccentric\" labour relations had failed rrrÂ· :s:::Â·\" Â·Â·- '. ~Â· iÂ·i~: ~'~Â·~Â·Â·~Â·;Â·`~Â·i~~~Â·~i:~ ...:Â·.~IÂ·; Â·Â·Â·Â·; :'\"'\"'~~d -:Â· Â·Â·Â· -Â·Â·Â·-Â· ~*;~:Â· The British unions have sup- ported EC social legislation for some time but it is only recently that traditional hostil- ity to the more legally restric- tive continental model has faded. With no prospect of repeal- ing legal restrictions, the unions believe they should benefit from the rights enjoyed by uniors on the nontinent. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, said yesterday a Labour govern- ment would act swiftly to introduce a package of positive rights for employees. The motion passed yesterday called only for an examination of how features of the \"Franco- German\" approach to indus- trial relations - such as works councils and greater rights to information - might be adapted to British circum- stances. There are still some reserva- tions about adapting other countries' systems to Britain but many senior union officials think the UK could have a ver- sion of the works council sys- tem within five years.

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington THE US is to establish immediate diplomatic relations with the Baltic states, joining 37 countries which have recog- nised Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as independent nations. The announcement yester- day followed high-level con- tacts between President George Bush and President Mikhail Gorbachev in which the US pressed successfully for the Soviet leader to acknowledge explicitly the Baltics' right to independence. At a news conference at his holiday home in Kennebunk- port, Maine, Mr Bush was care- ful to distinguish between US recognition of the Baltic states and other breakaway Soviet republics claiming indepen- dence from Moscow. It was too early to judge whether the US would recognise the other republics, he said. \"The Baltics are quite differ- ent. We never recognised their incorporation [in the Soviet Union] in the first place,\" Mr Bush said, referring to Stalin's annexation of Lithuania, Lat- via and Estonia in 1940 as a result of a pact with Nazi Ger- many. Lithuania's vice-president, Mr Bronislovas Kuzmickas, welcomed the US move. \"The process of diplomatic recogni- tion of Lithuania has reached its culmination,\" he said. \"And I feel we can now consider the struggle for our independence to have been, in essence, won.\" Mr Bush threw his weight behind Mr Gorbachev's efforts to create a new Soviet Union with substantial powers devolved from the centre in Moscow, the so-called ten-plus- one agreement. He also said he would resist pressure to cut the US defence budget in the light of the tur- moil in the Soviet Union. Over the past two years, the US has pressed Mr Gorbachev long and hard to grant freedom to the Baltic states. The campaign, interspersed by violent Soviet crackdowns, chiefly in Lithuania, took on fresh impetus after the abor- tive Kremlin coup two weeks ago. It was only last Sunday, after Mr Gorbachev declared he would not stand in the way of Baltic independence, that Mr Bush felt ready to respond with his own declaration with- out raising fears that the US was encouraging the break-up of the Soviet Union. \"I think the fact that we waited until now is not only understood but appreciated by [Mr Gorbachev] and hopefully by others in the Soviet Union,\" said Mr Bush. Mr Curtis Kamman, a senior US diplomat, is to visit the Bal- tic states shortly to assess eco- nomic and technical questions relating to Baltic indepen- dence. Mr Bush has referred on several occasions to the close economic ties between the Bal- tic states and Moscow. Mr Bush announced that he was extending to the end or 1992 an initiative called \"Proj- ect Hope\" which provides med- ical aid to the Baltics and other republics to meet acute short ages of pharmaceutical sup- plies. Originally, it was a one- year effort intended to end in December. Separately, two high-level US agriculture delegations are to visit the Soviet Union this month to assess food aid and possible help to the republics on food production and distri bution. Mr Bush, who is due to return to Washington this week after a month-long holi day in Maine, described the events in the Soviet Union as a \"turning point\" toward free dom and democracy.",

   "text_content" : "By Stian Wagstyl in Tokyo THE .Japanese Ministry of Finance, which is probing a spate of financial scandals, yeterday disclosed that it sus- pects stockbroking companies may have illegally promised clients guaranteed rates'of return on their securities investments. Brokers have admitted pay- ing compensation to favoured customers - which is not ille- gal even though it has been widely condemned - but have repeatedly denied promising compensation in advance. However, Mr Nobuhiko Mat- suno, director-general of the ministry's securities bureau, told a committee of the lower house of parliament yesterday that in 59 out of the 617 com- pensation payments investi- gated by the ministry, the cli- ent had not suffered any losses. Mr Matsuno told MPs the ministry was investigating whether these payments were made because the brokers had promised the client a specific minimum rate of return. Such pledges were banned in 1987. Mr Matsuno's suggestion that the brokerages may have broken the law on compensa- tion payments followed earlier remarks that the ministry sus- pected that Nomura Securities, the largest house, might have manipulated stock in Tokyu Corporation, a railway and property group, for the benefit of a criminal organisation. Taken together, Mr Mat- suno's testimony could be a sign that the ministry is pre- paring to press charges against the brokerages. But, given the complexities of Japa- nese securities law it may still be very difficult to prove. The securities companies were due today to appear before a hearing of a commit- tee of parliament's upper house. Those summoned to give evidence include Mr Set- suya Tabuchi, the former chairman of Nomura, who gave evideice to the lower house committee last week. He is likely to be questioned about Mr Matsuno's latest remarks. Meanwhile, a fourth person was arrested yesterday in the scandal involving illegal loans allegedly procured by Ms Nui Onone, an Osaka restaurateur. Mr Yoshiaki Ariki, a manager at National Leasing, a finance company, is suspected of breach-of-trust offences. Officials at Osaka district public prosecutor's office said that, unknown to his employ- ers, Mr Ariki had returned to Ms Nui securities certificates which she had pledged as col- lateral. This would have enabled her to use the certifi- cates as collateral to obtain other loans. Ms Nui is herself under arrest for using Y342bn (tl.5bn) In forged certificates of deposit from Toyo Shinkin Bank, a small Osaka bank, to obtain loans. A Toyo Shiakin oficial is also under arrest as is an executive of another finance company. National Leasing is an offshoot of Mat- sushita Electric Industrial, the electroani c embine.

   "text_content" : "The most dangerous moments in markets often come when a trend appears to have become unstoppable. Yesterday again saw te Footsie closing at a record high, part of its 34 point gain reflecting a fresh wave of bid talk. Talk of bids for Allied Lyons from Anheuser Busch and from BMW for Rolls Royce, however, looks as frothy as that which last week had Cad- bury Schweppes about to fall prey to Philip Morris. Most of these are old stories. If they are all that is holding the market up, the bulls look seriously guilty of wishful thinking. Bid activity may re- cover as prices rise and compa- nies feel more confident about the future. But this does 'not look likely on any significant scale for some time yet. A more plausible explana- tion for the market's show of strength lies in the improving outlook for inflation. This has not only helped the govern- ment's standing in opinion polls but has also driven the gilt market higher, so that equities still look undervalued. However, much of this better news must now be discounted, while the heavy prospective flow of rights issues looks set to limit attempts to drive the market to even giddier heights. Westland Westland's relief at being appointed alongside IBM as prime contractor for the gov- ernment's Â£1.5bn Merlin heli- copter order must be tinged with some apprehension. Theo- retically the deal will help secure Westland's future, but its main impact may be on the price at which the company eventually changes hands. The 11.5 per cent jump in West- land's shares yesterday sug- gests it is now considered a more attractive proposition for a bidder, especially since GKN is keen to divest its 22 per cent stake. The short-run earnings impact of the order will be minimal. The UK announce- ment should unlock orders by Italy and Canada. Deals worth perhaps Â£4bn may be signed up by Christmas, with about a quarter representing work for Westland's own account. That is not much different from what it could have expected had the rival partnership of British Aerospace and GEC been asked to take charge of the systems integration work. Admittedly, Westland can now expect a much larger profit margin, but it will be two years at least before this shows up in its accounts. With the uncertainty out of FT-SE Indea: 2,79.A (+33.9) Acquisitions & mergi within the UK Total value (tbn) 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 SM the way, the industrial logic of a bid by either of the disap- pointed rivals has become clearer. As prime contractor for the al-Yamamah defence agreement with Saudi Arabia, BAe would have an eye on the lucrative Black Hawk order which Westland is still expect- ing. GEC would gain an aero- space platform for its elec- tronic products on the lucrative model of its Yarrow involvement in shipping. These possibilities are likely to underpin the share price, though a historic p/e of 11 sug- gests expectations of a bid have already been partially dis- counted. Persimmon On the face of it a 22 per cent jump in Persimmon's interim dividend - combined with a mere 20 per cent fall in half year profits - is the sort of tonic the UK's contracting and construction sector has been gasping for. The reality, though, is rather different. Per- simmon is one of the better managed housebuilders with a long and relatively low cost land bank. Its payout, which now looks almost absurdly generous, was promised at the time of the March rights, when signs of a spring revival seemed more than an estate agent's dream. More relevant yesterday was the observation that the UK market continues to languish in recession. Investors who have watched the sector underperform by more than 40 per cent since early 1989 will doubtless be hoping for something chirpier in the string of interim announcements due this month. If so, they are probably being optimistic. It seems likely that fear of unemploy- ment and building society repossessions will replace high interest rates as the cap on house prices. Buyers' confi- dence has taken a severe knock, and those who talk about pent up demand for houses seem to forget that there is also pent up supply. Persimmon looks strong enough to grow profits and market share by volume alone, and enjoys the advantage of being a pure housebuilder. The contractors may find that any improvement in house prices over the next 12 months will be more than offset by falling activity next year, and possibly in 1993. The weakness of the private commercial construc- tion market is known; the size of the hole this will leave in profits may be less understood. Small companies The launch this week of the James Capel Trixie index brings to three the number of vehicles available for tracking the performance of small com- panies. Alongside the other models, Capel's looks like a nimble but garish custom car; its arrival could turn out to be well-timed. According to Hoare Govett, which runs the grand- father of the indices, small companies are finally set to end their long run of under- performance. If the sector's heavy exposure to economic recovery is to be fully dis- counted, a sharp period of out- performance is needed. That seems more likely in the fourth than the third quarter. Inves- tors in small companies are twice-shy, having been so badly bitten in the downturn. The main problem with the Trixie, a selection of smaller constituents representing just over 10 per cent of the All- Share index, is that it only pro- vides a full history from 1985. Both the Hoare and County indices go back several decades further, so they can be traced through half a dozen invest- ment cycles by specialist fund managers. Still, other investors will doubtless be attracted by Capel's appeal to commercial sense. The Trixie excludes illiq- uid or tightly-held stocks and investment trusts, making it a smaller equivalent of the FT-SE and so-called Tootsie (the second hundred stocks by market capitalisation) indices. Its definition of \"small\" - stocks worth more than Â£25m, but not more than Â£400m - includes some compa- nies which fall more easily into a mid-market category. Hoare includes no companies worth more than Â£175m. But the Trixie index is real-time and its emphasis on trading might allow cheaper dealing.",

   "text_content" : "IBy obe Petoaun MR GEORGE WALKER, the deposed chief executive of Brent Walker, is repudiating a 27.5m loan to a family trust from a con- sortium of banks led by Standard Chartered. This battle between the banks and Mr Walker is the latest epi- sode in Brent Walker's financal difficulties, which have forced losses on 47 banks and culmi- nated last week in the company's invitation to the Serious Fraud Office to investigate its affairs. Mr Walker's solicitors, D J Freeman, have written to Stan- dard Chartered informing the international bank that the trust, Jasaro, does not intend to repay the money. \"The banks broke the con- tract,\" Mr Walker said. The Â£27.5m loan was made on November 27, when Mr Walker was still chairman and chief executive of the company, to enable Jasaro to buy new bonds in Brent Walker. If Jasaro had not subscribed, the Â£100m bond sale would have flopped and this would have triggered a with- drawal of Brent Walker's bank- ing facilities and led to the col- lapse of the company. On November 26, Mr Walker wrote to Mr Malcolm Williamson, - Standard Chartered director, saying that he would not contem- late putting his money into the aond issue if there was any possi. ility of his being removed as chief executive. \"As you know, I have always agreed to accept a suitable non-executive chair- ..an,\" he wrote. \"I do not believe, however, that I could accept the idea of not being chief execu- tive.\" The followrin dga, Mr Wil liam son wrote back and said that the possibility of Mr Walker being removed as chairman and chief executive had been raised witt Mr Walker in early discussion only if the bond issue flopped. Mr Williamson then listed a series of changes to Brent Walker's board structure that the banks were insisting on. These included the appointment of a non-executive chairman but did not include the removal of Mr Walker as chief executive. He concluded by saying that the pro- posed board reorganisation was \"meant to strengthen your posi- tion rather than weaken it\". According to Mr Walker, Mr Williamson was here giving a commitment that he would not be removed as chief executive. His son, Mr Jason Walker, as chairman of Jasaro, signed the loan agreement with Standard Chartered only after this commit- ment was given. Standard Chartered and a group of other banks then lent the money. Mr Walker could not find other subscribers for the bonds and without his family's investment the issue would have flopped. The effect of this loan to the trust was to eliminate the risk that all Brent Walker's banks would withdraw loans to the company. In May, Standard Chartered, acting for all 47 banks, forced Brent Walker's board to remove Mr Walker as chief executive. Standard Chartered said yester- day that it had been given legal advice that it was in a strong pos- ition in any future case against Mr Walker to recover the money.",

   "text_content" : "Charles Leadbeater assesses how ICI is coping with the recession comnared with its rivals in the chemical industry on the Continent he director of BASS, the German chemical group, considered when the European chemical Industry may begin to recover: \"We will not be out of this until 1994.\" That estimate for the recovery is becoming widely accepted in an industry which is slowly get- ting used to the end of the boom of the late 1980s. All European chemical produc- ers suffered in the first half of the year. But some suffered more than others. The performance of Ciba-Geigy, the largest Swiss chemical group, was the most impressive, with an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profts, fol- lowed by Bayer which limited its profits fall to 3.2 per cent. At the other end of the scale, Rhdne-Poulenc, the French chemical group, today announces half-year results which most analysts expect to show profits down by between 50 per cent and 60 per cent. That is likely to be welcomed with a sigh of relief at Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK group close to the bottom of the league with first-half pre-tax profits down 31 per cent. It is a testing time for ICI. Hanson, the acquisitive UK con- glomerate, has the chemicals combine under close scrutiny and ICFs performance over the next few months could deter- mine whether Hanson eventually launches a bid. The half-year results are the first opportunity to compare its recent perfor- mance with its European peers. Is it weathering the recession worse than its competitors? The downturn is driven by sac- tors which suggest chemical pro- ducers could be suffering for some time yet. Full-blown recession in English-speaking economies - North America, the UK and Aus- tralia - has been the main rea- son for reduced volumes. Capac- ity utilisation of plastics and ethylene plants in Europe has fallen to about 85 per cent, from a peak of 100 per cent in 1988. More important, prices have fallen because of growing over- 75% chanoe 50 25 i -25 % change 75 European ndex ICI pre-tax pmrofits capacity. Mr Stuart Wamsley, the chemical Industry consultant who publishes Focus on Chemi- cals newsletter, estimates that for the average European chemi- cal company, a 1 per cent fall in prices cats profits by a much as a 5 per cent fall in volumes. Massive investments in the Far East by western chemical companies in the last few years is curtailing a traditional export market and adding to world capacity in some bulk chemicals. Capacity, which was planned in the boom conditions of the late 1980s, is still coming onstream and cuts in capital investment programmes have been modest. The problem of soft selling prices has been compounded by a squeeze of higher raw material pries. Naphtha, an oil-derived ingredient in many chemical pro. cesses, Is selling at more than $200 a tonne, compared with about $150 a tonane before the start of the Gulf crisis. Mr Wam- sley says: \"Most ethylene produc- ers are probably only just cover- in their fixed costs.\" there are strlklg differences in the way companies are setting out to deal with the downturn. ICIs managers are in the middle of an urgent and far-reaching review of all aspects of their business. Dr Albert Eckell, a BASS director, says: \"When times are hard it is always tempting to rush into changes of direction or to adopt the flavour of the month. We take a longer view of our business.\" In spite of differences in man- agement culture, the companies' strengths can be assessed against four factors. * Geography. The Germans have been buoyed by what Mr Max Dietrich Kley, a BASS exec- utive director, calls the \"special conditions of German reunifica- tion\" while ICI has been hit side- ways partly because a third of its sales are in the UK. As the Ger- man economy slows, the Ger- mans' performance may look less impressive. * Product mix. Companies with strong pharmaceuticals divisions have done best. At ICI, profits from pharmaceuticals rose from 27 per cent in 198m to 47 per cent in 1990 largely by default because of the poorelative per- formance of divisions. ICI may be in a better position than DSM of the Netherlands, which has no pharmaceuticals inter- ests, but it is weaker than Bayer which has the fastest growing pharmaceuticals business in Europe. * Integration. The more inte- grated producers which make their own basic feedstocks for downstream processes have jug- gled their margins to take advantage of movements in raw material costs and selling prices. BASS was helped by its oil and gas interests, whereas Hoechst was hurt by its need to buy in much of its raw material. * Costs. This is the area where ICI really slipped up in the late 1980s. Between 1988 and 19809, ICrs sales per employee rose by about 8 per cent, about the same as Hoechst and BASS but lower than Bayer at 13.8 per cent. But ICI was paying a lot more for its increase in sales. Between 1987 and 1990, ICrs pay bill for its workforce rose 36 per cent, com- pared with a 14 per cent increase at the German companies. However, ICI managers seem determined to close the gap. Pay increases in the UK this year and next are likely to match German increases. ICI s planning to cut about 15,000 Jobs by the end of the year, compared with an employment reduction of about 8,000 at BASS, 4,500 at Bayer, at least 1,500 at Ciba Geigy and lit- tle change at Hoechst. Id's profits did not rise as fast as the rest of the European chemical industry during its boom and fell more steeply in the recession, largely because of its dependence on UK sales, the relative weakness of its pharma- ceuticals division and its failure to keep costs under control. In Germany over the next few years, BASS will probably be carried through by Its all-round technological and financial streagth, while Bayer will be pulled through by its fast-grow- ing pharmaceuticals division. A question mark will hang over Hoechst, which has a big stake in plastics without controlling its raw material supplies. Id's future is the most diffi- cult to predict. It is cutting costs with a vengeance which the Ger- mans cannot match. Just as it underperformed in the last few years, ICI may emerge from this recession looking sharper than its competitors. However tack- ling its deeper weaknesses - its over-exposure to the UK and the relative weakness of its pharma- ceuticals division - will take much longer.",

   "text_content" : "By Jon ulle r A BITTER European price war for steel products, which has been raging since late last year, was the main reason fora drop of more than 60 per cent in the interim pre-tax profit of ASW Holdings. The Cardiff-based steel and wire group made 8.1m pre tax in the six months to June 30, com- pared with Â£2l.1m. The sudden- ness of the decline is illustrated by the tact that the group made more than SUnm in the second hir of last year. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said prices in 1990, when the group made MUSm taxable profit on MUS4m turnover, had been -y marginally above the 196 leveL Since the end of the year, they had fallen by up to 12 per ant to around the 1988 level ASW's comment yesterday that c in continental Europe \"are not sustainable unless supported by state aid or subsidy, no longer permitted by the European Com- mission\" echoes complaints made by British Steel and German pro- ducers about state-owned busi- nesses, particularly in France but also in Italy. A recent example is British Steel's call, backed by the UK goverument, for the European Commision to investigate a deal involving Credit Lyonnais, the French stateowned bank, paying FFr25bn (Â£20m) for a 10 per cent stake in Usinor Sacilor, the state- owned steel producer. Mr Cox said yesterday that the commission should look at \"why the industry is losing money. If it were all private sector, it could not be tolerated\". ASW still claims to be one of Europe's lowest-cost producers, which is supported by the fact that otput inreased again. The sall in Mirst-half turnover to Â£206.2m from Â£251.9m was caused by the lower prices - for raw material as wel as finished prod- uct - and the reduced purchas- ing of billet, which had previ- ously been sold on at low margins. It was the first profit fall at ASW - formerly Allied Steel and Wire - since its formation as a joint venture compan between British Steel and , the com- ponents group, in 1981 as part of the Phoenix programme. It was floated on the stock market in May 1988. Although more than half its turnover 'es in the UK, Mr Cox stressed that the domestic reces- sion in construction and engi- neeringda had been a less impr- tant fator in the pvff dint than the eAtiial pricA war. Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 4p (11p) and the Inter dividend is d at 4.5p.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent TIRE DEEP recession in the UK housing market shows no signs of easing according to Pereim- mon, which has grown to become one of the country's 10 largest housebuilders. The group said yesterday that pre-tax profits had fallen by almost a fifth from Â£15.5m to Â£12.5m during the six months to end-June. Mr Duncan Davidson, chair- man and managing director said: \"Sales fell sharply in June and July after recovering in March. Prices appear to have stopped falling and sales are now bumping along the bottom. The next move should be upwards. Price rises, how- ever, will not occur until some time after sales have started to increase.\" Turnover rose marginally from Â£67.9m to Â£68.5m. Earn- ings per share fell from 12.7p to to 10.lp, still covering by more than three times an interim dividend increased from 2.3p to 2.8p. The share price rose by 6p to 284p on grlunds that larger earnings falls are likely to be announced by other house- builders during the next few weeks. George Wimpey, Britain's second biggest housebuilder, announces its first half results tomorrow, while Barratt, the third largest builder, has already warned that it incurred a Â£100m pre-tax loss during the year to end-June. Mr Davidson said that sales by housebuilders had been restricted by concern about ris- ing unemployment. Persim- mon, nonetheless, expects to build about 2,200 homes this year - 10 per cent more than during 1990. The increase reflects a switch in sales emphasis towards first time buyers and expansion into new sales areas. Average selling prices during the first six months of this year were about 11 per cent lower than during the corre- sponding period in 1990,. he said. As a result, pr-tax margins fell from a peak f 25 pr cent to about 18 per cent. \" still 9uts us among the top three housebulders for mar- gins,\" he added. Following the successful Â£3m rights issue in March the group had net cash of about Elm at the period end. It plans to increase annual out- put of houses to about 4,000 during the next three to four years. Mr Davidson said this would mean increasing the land bank which currently comprises 11,500 plots with planning per- mission. Part of Persimmon's strength has been its long land bank, part of which had been acquired up to five years ago at cheaper prices. The group has been one of the few builders which has not been forced to write down the value of its land holdings as a result of falling property prices.

   "text_content" : "Byv John Griffiths MAYFLOWER Corporation yesterday completed the pur- chase of Motor Panels, the Cov- entry-based vehicle design, engineering and truck cab manufacturing company which had been in receivership for several months, following approval of the deal by share- holders. Mayflower, the listed holding company for a group operating in specialist manufacturing, advertising, marketing and financial services, is financing the Â£17m acquisition with a rights issue and share place- ment. The purchase will lead to a quadrupling of Mayflower's turnover. Its shares were suspended on June 13, when it announced that it was negotia- ting a large acquisition. Deal- ings in its existing ordinary shares are expected to resume today. Motor Panels has a work- force of 650 in Coventry and 150 in Wigan, as well as a US subsidiary, Motor Panels Inc, based in Ohio and North Caro- lina, and which supplies cabs for Mack, Freightliner, Western Star and Autocar trucks. Motor Panels went into receivership when CH Industri- als, its parent company, col- lapsed. Its fate was a matter of considerably concern to the UK motor industry.

It also provides the steel underbody of the Lotus Elan sports car. In the 11 months to end-Feb- ruary the company's UK operations made an operating profit of Â£1.9m on turnover of Â£38.4m, while the US operations made $1.3m operat- ing profit on turnover of $33.2m in the year to end- March.

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper WILLIS FABER and Dumas, the reinsurance broking sub- sidiary of Willis Corroon, the international broker, has been authorised to open a represen- tative office in Moscow, under- lining growing foreign interest in the Soviet insurance mar- ket. Willis is one of a number of international brokers - others include Sedgwick, Alexander & Alexander and Marsh Maclen- nan - already working with Soviet partners but the group claimed yesterday that it is the first to win the formal accredi- tation of the Soviet finance ministry. Two months ago Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurance company, also opened a Moscow office. More than a year ago Willis set up a joint venture with Dynamic, a computer company based in Moscow. But the accreditation will allow Willis greater freedom of operation in the Soviet Union - allowing it to open a bank account in its own name for the first time, for example. In the longer term it will per- mit the group to cement exist- ing ties with the Soviet insur- ers, Gosstrakh and Ingosstrakh, according to Mr Michael White, Willis's territo- rial managing director for cen- tral and eastern Europe. It also clears the way for the company to expand its range of operations by offering its ser- vices to existing multinational clients - including a number of oil companies - which may be interested in investing in the Soviet Union. Willis also hopes to offer risk management and consultancy services on the local market."

   "text_content" : "UNIDARE, the Dublin-based welding equipment, cables and heaters group, yesterday reported a marginal increase, from IÂ£2.31m to IE2.35m (Â£2.1m), in interim profits. The taxable outcome for the six months to June 30 was struck after an exceptional gain of IE500,000 from land sales and came from turnover of IE49.6m (IÂ£50.5m). Mr Jim Culliton, chairman, said that most of the group's activities had encountered hard trading conditions. \"If the depressed market conditions in the UK continue it will be diffi- cult to make progress in the current year\" he stated. Nevertheless, the interim dividend is raised to 4.lp (3.9p), payable from earnings of 11.46p (12.09p) per share. Pittencrieff more than trebles to Â£1.6m Pittencrieff, the Edinburgh- based company with invest- ments in oil and gas as well as mobile communications within the US, more than trebled prof- its in the six months to June 30. On turnover more than dou- bled to Â£4.2m (Â£2m), pre-tax profits rose to Â£1.55m (Â£482,000). Mr Michael Munro, chairman, said he was \"delighted to report such excel- lent results, particularly in present recessionary condi- tions\". He said that oil and gas pro- duction had increased by more than 20 per cent since the beginning of the year and that field developments should pro- vide further improvement in the second half. The communications side was expanding both organi- cally and through acquisition with repetitive billings up from $257,000 (Â£153,000) per month at the beginning of the year to about $500,000 currently. Gross profits were Â£1.78m (Â£867,000), though administra- tive expenses rose to Â£611,000 (Â£353,000) and interest payable to Â£151,000 (Â£40,000). Other income contributed Â£535,000 (Â£8,000). Earnings per share worked through at 7.19p (4.95p or 4.2p adjusted for the conver- sion of preference shares). The interim dividend is lifted to 2.5p (2p). Kingston Oil & Gas doubles to Â£0.76m Kingston Oil & Gas raised pre- tax profits from Â£397,000 to Â£761,000 in the first half of 1991. Turnover rose from Â£126m to Â£3.59m. The oil and gas producer also announced that Sir Roland Smith was to resign as chair- man at the end of September to give more time to other busi- ness interests, particularly in London. He will be succeeded by Mr Ray Chambers, cur- rently chief executive. Sir Roland said Kingston had continued to make real prog- ress in Ohio but that it was only towards the end of June that a substantial number of the wells drilled were hooked up for gas sales. Orcol Fuels, which collects, processes and distributes recovered fuel oil and was acquired late last year for Â£4.5m, had \"an excellent first half'. Earnings per share rose to 4.48p (3.46p) and the interim dividend is lifted to lp (0.56p). Interest burden hits Robert Lowe Robert H Lowe, the Cheshire- based leisure, baby and chil- dren's wear group, incurred an interim loss of Â£396,000 pre-tax. The outcome for the six months to end-April compared with a deficit of Â£371,000 last time and losses of Â£453,000 for the previous full year. Sales, reflecting intense competition and difficult conditions in the high street, dipped some 4 per cent to Â£15.8m. However, at the trading level profits moved ahead from Â£168,000 to Â£403,000. Interest charges took less at Â£799,000 (Â£947,000), still \"a heavy bur- den\" according to Mr Paul Lee, chairman. Losses per share emerged at 8.27p (7.44p); there is again no interim dividend. Sale Tilney trims losses to Â£3.7m Sale Tilney, the foods, indus- trial and financial services company, reduced its losses from Â£3.91m to Â£3.68m pre-tax for the half-year ended May 31. Exceptional provisions were reduced to Â£1.89m (f2m) and interest costs to Â£2.31m (Â£3.15m). Losses per ordinary share emerged at 13.6p (15.3p). Turnover amounted to Â£69.3m (Â£77.3m). The group is disposing of its 25 per cent investment in Finad, a Swiss fund manage- ment company, for an agreed SFr1.lm (Â£430,000) cash. Murray Income assets down 4.8% Murray Income Trust's net asset value fell some 5 per cent from 267.3p to 254.5p per share in the year to June 30. The proposed final dividend is 3.6p making a total of 9.9p, an increase of 10 per cent. Rev- enue reserves increased to Â£5.4m, equivalent to 60 per cent of next year's dividend forecast of a total of 10.6p. Sir Ian Denholm, chairman, said that in recent months the trust became fully invested in equities, as the market fall had pushed share prices down to levels thought to offer extremely good value. New chairman for Business Technology Mr Tony Berry, the founder and former chairman of Blue Arrow, has been appointed executive chairman of the Business Technology Group. Mr Peter James has resigned as chairman to pursue his pri- vate business interests. BTG also intends to appoint a finance director and an addi- tional non-executive director in the near future. Mr Berry is also chairman of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Â£3.6m expansion for Northumbrian Water Northumbrian Water has moved into the environmental services sector with the acqui- sition for Â£3.6m of Glasgow- based James Duncan Holdings. Of the purchase price, Â£3.3m will be satisfied by the issue of 916,667 Northumbrian shares with the balance of Â£300,000 in cash. Operating in Scotland and the north-east, JDH is the par- ent of a number of companies which provide environmental services, such as sewer cleaning. In the year to end- March the group had turnover of Â£3.86m.",

   "text_content" : "By Philp Rawonrne in London and Terry Hall in Wellington GRAND MBTROPOLITAN and Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks groups, have each acuIred a 2 per cent stake in New Za- land Wines Spirits (NEWS), the liquor manufacturing and distribution ubsidlary of Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer. Lion Nathan said yesterday that the deal was worth a total of NZ61m (Â£0.7m). The move reflects the policy of the UK groups to secure tighter control of the market- ing and distribution of their brands in international mar- kets. NZWS is the family company of Mr Douglas Myers, Lion Nathan's managing director and main shareholder. He said that the proceeds would be used to repay debt, which has grown since last year's pur- chase of a half share in Bond Brewing. He said there would be no changes in the management of NZWS: \"The arrangement will ensure existing brand agree- ments continue and will also allow access to new brands developed or acquired by the two International partners.\" Mr Malcolm Don, Lion Nathan corporate treasurer, said that a significant portion of the money being paid would be profit and treated as an extraordinary gain for the year to August 31. NZWS was estimated to be making profits of NZ$20m a year before inter- est payments and tax. GrandMet's MV spirits com- panv has been associated with n Nathan for more than 20 years and already had an interest in its liquor manufac- turing business which pro- duces IDV's Smirnoff vodka and Gilbey's gin. Allied-Lyons's Hiram Walker spirits offshoot, whose brands include Ballantine's whisky and Courvoisier cognac, Joined forces in 1985 with IDV and NZWS in Swift and Moore, one of Australia's leading liquor distributors. Allied is also understood to be discussing a deal with Lion Nathan on the European rights to Castlemaine XXXX lager."

   "text_content" : "By Jan Fuller A SECOND-half squeeze on margins and losses in busi- nesses that have been closed or sold cut pre-tax profit at Peter Black, the personal care and footwear business, by nearly 30 per cent. The taxable figure for the 12 months to June 1 fell from 210.Sm to Â£7.24m on reduced turnover of Â£126m (Â£142.8m). The West Yorkshire-based manufacturer and distributor relies on Marks and Spencer for about 60 per cent of its business. Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman with his brother Thomas, said the group had decided to get out of home fur- nishings because it was in dan- ger of making serious losses. Started a few years ago to sup- ply M and S, it had built up to turnover of Â£28m and 700 employees. It lost Â£300,000 last year before two subsidiaries were closed and three sold, includ- ing Hornsea Pottery. The other discontinued busi- ness was the original core: vul- canised slippers. These had fallen victim to cheap imports and changing fashion. Overall, the workforce was cut from 3,800 to 2,300. Although interest costs fell only slightly to Â£3.08m (Â£3.29m), net debt at the year end was Â£6m lower at Â£13.39m, giving gearing of 39 per cent (52 per cent). Mr Black said the biggest profit earner was personal care - toiletries, cosmetics and remedies - which had built up to annual turnover of Â£40m since 1983. It was helped by a full-year pre-tax profit contri- bution of Â£500,000 (Â£300,000) from English Grains. Footwear, which accounted for 40 per cent of turnover, had suffered from low retail sales. Earnings per share fell to 9.16p (1.35). The final divi- dend is held at 2.07p for an unchanged total of 2.84p. Extraordinary charges total- ling Â£7.5m, related to the dis- continued businesses, left an attributable loss of Â£4.04m (profit of 4.96m). * COMMNT A typically positive statement from Mr Black, whose family owns nearly 40 per cent of the shares, was that \"if there is anything good about a reces- sion, it focuses attention on the changes that have to be made.\" In the past year, the group has righted the mistake of going into furniture in the late 1980s and reluctantly withdrawn from its original slipper busi- ness, at some cost to share- holders' funds. Just as impor- tant, it has pruned debt, stock and the workforce in its remaining operations. It does, however, remain M and S dependent - not that it com- plains about this. The aim is to make the best of the relation- ship by concentrating on areas where M and S has a low but growing market share, notably in footwear. To improve the balance of its business, it is developing both the supply of private label products to other retailers and its own branded goods from English Grains. It should be in a good position to benefit when that elusive com- modity \"consumer confidence\" returns. A current year pre-tax profit forecast of just over Â£9m gives an undemanding prospec- tive p/e of less than 11 on yes- terday's closing price of 128p.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-03",
   "text_content" : "ritain's corporate chair- men may be returning from their August breaks with more than the usual holiday spring in their steps. For the first time since the economy nose-dived last year, the interim results season which gets into full swing today may provide genuine sig- nals that the worst of the recession is over. The effects of dreadful first- half trading conditions are still to work through into reduced profits and further pressure on dividends. But analysts see an end to the \"death by a thousand cuts\" which the market has suffered over a period when profits warnings and gloomy forecast- have surfaced with painful reg- ularity. \"The first half of 1991 has seen profits squeezed more than expected and we are still downgrading forecasts,\" says Mr Alun Jones, equity market analyst at UBS Phillips & *irew. \"But hopes are rising that the accompanying statemente from chairmen will bring new confidence.\" The one concern holding this renewed confidence in check is the prospect of more rights issues. The recent Ladbroke and P&O cash calls, both triggered by the need to bolster bruised balance sheets, kicked off a season which will be spent try ing to spot companies likely to announce rights issues with their results. Even if chairmen can deliver optimistic notes in their state- ments, the market is going to have to weather some grim results. The building and contracting sector will continue to show the effect of one of the worst recessions in its history. Tay lor Woodrow, George Wimpey, Amec and Blue Circle will reflect to varying degrees the depths of gloom in the con struction sector. Not only has demand fallen off a wall in many of their mar- kets, but the UK builders have also had to resort to substan tial financial incentives to make sales. This will badly dent mar gins. Judging by Alfred MIcAlpine's results last week, this sector is unlikely to be one looking ahead to imminent turnround. Composite insurers such as Sun Alliance, which reports on Thursday, have been vulnera- ble to the combination of reces- sion and high interest rates. This has left many people unable to keep up their mort- gage repayments, thereby forc-t ing the insurers to meet mort- gane indemnity policies. The recession-related increases in theft and arson have also hit the insurers. In the engineering and aero- space sectors as well as the motor parts and metals sectors, the first half of the year will have seen dramatic falls in profits. Here more than anywhere, confidence has been badly drained by the effects of the Gulf war and by high interest rates. Perhaps representative of this fall is T&N, the automo- tive component and engineer- ing materials supplier, which is likely to report profits down by more than half to Â£17.5m tomorrow, according to County INatWest WoodMac. But the market has decided to take some cheer from two recent notes of optimism. Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, said last week that recession had nit bottom in March and, more recently, that it had seen signs of recovery in the DIY market. Given the accepted wisdom that the turnround in the econ- omy will have to result from a recovery in consumer spend- ing, this news has been greeted with pleasure. The other note of optimism comes from Glynwed, the Mid- lands-based engineering group, which reported two weeks ago. In spite of predictably awful first-half results, with profits sharply down from Â£40.4m to Â£10.4m, the chairman exciteu the market by maintaining that the company was coming out of recession in some sec- tors and had bottomed out in others. The brewers - which encompass a number of leisure and hotel interests where prof- its are highly geared to eco- nomic recovery and consumer spending - healthcare and tores have all been hit hard. In the food and consumer goods sector, there is likely to be less misery.

In spite of the generally grim first half, there are increasing signs that consumer confi- dence is beginning to trickle back. \"There has been,\" says Mr Paul Walton, UK equity strate- gist at James Capel, \"a consist- ent improvement in consumer sales, because of unfulfilled consumer demand, and this will take hold with a ven- geance over the Christmas period.\" There are other reasons why chairmen of some companies - though not those in services and construction - might add an extra sprinkle of optimism to their interim statements, says Mr Walton. He expects the electrical, electronics, engineering and motor component sectors to enjoy a sharp recovery in the second half because they will benefit from volume increases with few additional labour costs. The leisure and media sec- tors could benefit from taking additional revenue from hotel occupancy and advertising rev- enue straight to the bottom line, reversing the heavy hits they incurred when the econ- omy was heading down. Furthermore, UK companies will start to benefit from the effective depreciation of ster- ling against the dollar which will help boost exports and will also help translate US profits into higher reported UK profits. Many analysts temper their rising mood of confidence with a common cautionary note. The market will only start to chase share prices up if com- pany chairmen back any confi- dent statements about the economy with action. That will require more of the proceeds of the recent spate of rights issues, which have so far raised about Â£7bn, to be spent on acquisitions and the devel- opment of new opportunities. However, there are no signs that UK companies are yet on the acquisition trail. According to UBS Phillips & Drew, about three quarters of the rights issue proceeds raised this year have been used to patch up balance sheets exposed by the recession as being heavily over-geared.",

   "text_content" : "y Mllchlyo Nokamoto .MR TREVOR Sinn, chairman of Pendragon, the motor dis- tributor, yesterday warned that he did not foresee an immediate upturn in new vehicle business; the statement accompanied a 36 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1991. He said that a continuing fall in new car registrations had cut profits to Â£2.02m (Â£3.14m) despite a higher contribution rom other activities. However, although he did not foresee a quick bounce in car sales, he added: \"We believe we're at the bottom of he cycle.\" The contribution to gross profit from new vehicle sales ell 49 per cent to Â£2.5m. In particular, demand for higher value prestige cars in which the group specialises had declined substantially, Mr Sinn said. Rolls-Royce suffered a 49 per cent decline in new car regis- trations, with Porsche down 47 per cent and Jaguar 46 per cent. This compares with a 25 per cent fall in total new car regis- trations in the UK in the first half of 1991. The company said that, excluding recently acquired businesses, overhead costs were less than for the first half of 1990, and funding costs were reduced by 44 per cent. Group turnover was down to Â£77m (Â£94.8m) and earnings per share fell 38 per cent to 5.8p (9.4p). However, the interim dividend is increased 11 per cent to 2p (1.8p). The contribution from the contract hire business declined to Â£900,000 (Â£1.3m) as the mar- ket for luxury and executive car use declined and offset increased profits from used-car sales of Â£1.8m (Â£1.4m) and of Â£6.3m (Â£5m) from after-sales activities. Interest costs were reduced to Â£698,000 (Â£1.26m) by a combi- nation of lower working capital requirements and lower new vehicle stock levels. The group has continued to invest in new business develop- ment, including the purchase of Autohaus Kronberg, one of the largest Jaguar dealers in Germany and the addition of three new Japanese franchises. On August 5 the company bought the Rolls-Royce, Ferrari and Lotus dealer for Manches- ter for a nominal Â£1. It is in discussion with Nis. san and there was a strong possibility that it would be sell- ing Nissan cars next year, it said.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller REPAYMENT OF unauthorised spending by two directors of Ritz Design, a sup- plier of blouses and underwear to Marks and Spencer, has led to an extraordinary gain of Â£485,000 in the group's revised accounts. Mr Michael Bancroft, former chairman, and Mr Tony Cart- wright, former finance direc- tor, spent Â£650,000 without approval over three years. Most of it was incurred by Mr Bancroft and the prac- tice accelerated last year. The two men have promised to repay the money by the end of October. So far, Mr Bancroft is understood not to have sold any of his 21 per cent stake in the company, worth about Â£3m. The extraordinary gain in the revised accounts for the year to March 31 is after tax deductions. No other changes have been made to Ritz's results, which showed a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Â£2.5m on turnover of Â£38.5m (Â£33.2m). The company has since appointed a new finance direc- tor and two non-executive directors.",

   "text_content" : "By John Burton in Stockholm THE Stockholm Stock Exchange is to launch an investigation into the circum- stances surrounding the col- lapse of the corporate empire controlled by Mr Erik Penser, the Swedish financier. Attention may focus on alleged transactions among the Penser companies concerning the distribution of highly-lever- aged assets, such as property holdings, and the possibility that the share prices of the Penser companies had been manipulated, according to Mr Bengt Ryden, the Stockholm bourse president. Improvements in informa- tion disclosure about loans from banks and other credit institutions will also be exam- ined. The bourse is also interested in the loan guarantee at the centre of the liquidity crisis affecting Mr Penser's holdings. The credit squeeze resulted in Nobel Industries, the chemi- cals and defence concern, and Yggdrasil, Mr Penser's private investment company, being taken over by the state-con- trolled Nordbanken, Mr Pen- ser's biggest creditor. Nobel and Yggdrasil prom- ised the banks last autumn that the equity ratio in Gam- lestaden, their associated finance company, would not fall below 16 per cent. The pledge was made to secure SKrl4.Sbn ($2.38bn) in short-term loans for Gamles- taden as its credit losses started to mount. When Gamlestaden recently reported that credit losses had exhausted its shareholder equity, the loan guarantee was cited by Nordbanken to justify its takeover of Nobel and Ygg- drasil, while Gamlestaden fell under the control of a 14-bank consortium led by Skandina- viska Enskilda Banken. Nobel did not discuss the loan guarantee in its 1990 annual report. It claimed last week that it did not believe that the guarantee would mean that Nobel would default on the Gamlestaden loans if the finance company failed to maintain the equity ratio. Rather, it interpreted the guarantee as giving the banks the right to refuse more loans if the equity ratio fell below the ageed level. But Nobel did not protest when Nordbanken used the guarantee clause to take con- trol of the company last week. Swedish newspapers alleged over the weekend that Mr Pen- ser's bank creditors might have provoked the liquidity crisis in order to take over his holdings and quickly reduce their over-exposed lending position to him. Mr Roger Holtback, the pres- ident of SE Banken's Gothen- burg office and a key figure in the Nobel rescue bid, dismissed the charges as a \"cock-and-bull story\". There were also suggestions in the Swedish press that Nord- banken used the Penser crisis as a pretext to take the other- wise controversial step of issu- ing SKr5bn in new shares to improve its capital reserve ratio."

The group's consolidated pre-tax profits rose from Pta56.24bn to Pta74.5bn. Telefonica said its invest- ments of Pta245bn in the first half of the year represented a 15.4 per cent fall on 1990. It added, however, that it had managed to raise the number of telephone lines in service in Spain to 12.9m, a 6.2 per cent increase on the end of the first half of 1989."

   "text_content" : "Mark Westfield in Sydney BORAL, the Australian building materials and energy group, reported its first earn- ings downturn for 21 years yes- terday, with a 34.4 per cent drop in net profit for the year to June 30 to A$211.4m (US$165.1m). Sir Peter Finley, chairman, described trading conditions for the year as \"the worst in the company's history\" and saw no sign of an upturn. Boral has grown on the back of a series of housing and com- mercial property booms and through vigorous acquisition to become the country's 17th largest company, with market capitalisation of A$3bn. Boral has substantial operations in the US and Europe, but still earns three- quarters of its revenue in Aus- tralia. All the regional operations reported operating profit falls. Australia fell 12.5 per cent, Europe 75 per cent, and the Asia Pacific region 39 per cent, making an overall fall of 25.6 per cent before interest and tax to A$452m. Sales revenues fell 2.9 per cent to A$3.9bn. Recession in the UK cut demand in Boral's masonry, fly ash and lightweight aggregates operations, dragging earnings down for the whole European division. Mr Kean said Boral would expand in Germany, where its brick, tile, and quarrying busi- nesses were doing well. One bright spot in the other- wise gloomy outlook was the 29 per cent increase in sales to the Asia Pacific region. Directors declared a fully franked, or tax free, final divi- dend of 8 cents, against a 13 cent final payout last year. This took the annual dividend to 20 cents, against 25 cents in 1990.",

   "text_content" : "By Haig SmonMlan in Milan NEW evidence has come to light indicating links not previ- ously admitted between the two Italian stockbtokers which went into forced liquidation last week and companies asso- lcated with Mr Roberto Caprioglio, the Italian sinan- cier. One of Mr Caprioglio's com- panies, Dominion Trust, is at the heart of the L1OObn alleged share fraud discovered last month by Banque Dumdnil Lebl6 (Suisse), the Swiss sinan- cial institution controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti. Domin- ion Trust has no connection with the Canadian trust com- pany of the same name. The alleged fraud has para- lysed Milan Stock Exchange trading and forced the post- ponement of last week's sched- uled bourse settlement date. As a result of their failure to produce L52bn ($39m) and L18.5bn of shares respectively in time for the settlement, the two brokers, Studio Adorno, of Milan, and Studio Montalcini, of Turin, were declared insol- vent last week. They have denied any links with Mr Caprioglio, or involve- ment in the alleged fraud involving the missing shares cleared through Assets Devel- opment Bank (ADB), the small Swiss financial institution merged into Dumdnil Leble in July. The two have threatened legal action against the De Benedetti group. A preliminary hearing of a claim by Misafin, a small finance house also declared insolvent, is due to take place in Milan tomorrow. The new evidence shows that Studio Adorno is listed on the 1990 accounts of Dominion International Bank, one of Mr Caprioglio's associate compa- nies, as being a creditor for L45bn. Meanwhile, investigations in Canada, where Mr Caprioglio is believed to have at least four companies operating, has revealed a link between SFP International, which is quoted on the Alberta Stock Exchange, and Mr Andrea Soave, a stock exchange floor trader closely linked with Stu- dio Montalcini. A June 11 news release from SFP International announcing Mr Soave's appointment states that he was \"formerly\" with Montalcini. However, he is still associated with the firm, where he is described as a \"freelance collaborator\". Mr Soave has signatory rights for the broker, whose letterhead also carries his name. The link between Mr Soave and Mr Caprioglio also extends to Dominion Investment Group, a Canadian company of which Mr Caprioglio is chair- man and president. Mr Soave is listed as the company's vice-president. In May and August last year, Dominion Trust Bankers, one of Mr Caprioglio's companies, bought C$1.5m of warrants in SFP International. SFP International's largest asset is an 80 per cent share in Societe Financibre Priv6e, a Geneva-based private bank, headed by Mr Riccardo Tat- toni, which maintained close business relations with ADB and is also part of the investi- gation being conducted by Swiss magistrates. Mr Soave was not available for comment yesterday. According to Mr Montalcini, Mr Soave works as a floor trader, but on a freelance basis. Mr Montalcini said he was \"not aware\" of Mr Soave's Canadian interests. He added that Mr Soave had recently stopped working for the firm. The two brokers have main- tained that their relations with Dumdnil LeblE were thor- oughly in order, and it was Dumdnil Leble's failure to deliver shares as part of a reg- ular repurchase agreement which triggered their bank- ruptcy.",

   "text_content" : "I Linotype-Hell finds the going tough, writes Andrew Fisher E were caught rather wrong-footed,\" admits Mr Wolfgang Kummer, the chief executive of Linotype-Hell, the German printing equipment company formed last October from the merger of the two companies which make up its name. The combination of Linotype and Rudolf Hell created the world's biggest company in the field of image-setting and reproduction technology, with turnover set to exceed DMlbn ($570m) in 1991. But this and last year are not proving the easiest of times in which to begin a new life together. In the first half of 1991, net profits of Linotype-Hell plunged by 70 per cent to DMII.3m as the merger costs combined with deteriorating markets - especially abroad, where the group does nearly 75 per cent of its business - to produce a tough trading envi- ronment. \"Last year was the merger year, 1991 is the reorganisation year, and 1992 should be the first year when the synergy effects start to show through fully,\" says Mr Kummer. Clearly, the problems in important foreitjn markets have come at an awkward time for the newly-merged concern. Mr Kummer says he would have liked to merge with Hell 10 years ago. But Siemens, which owned the company and now has a 33 per cent stake in Linotype-Hell, did not want to sell. However, Siemens realised that Hell, which was run as a separate subsidiary, did not really fit in with the rest of the electrical and electronics group. As the recession has gripped key overseas markets such as the US, where business was up in dollar terms last year but down in D-Marks, Linotype has found its rivals stepping up the pace. \"Competition is fierce,\" Mr Kummer says. While a typical Linotype product costs around DM100,000, those of Hell, which specialises in colour technol- ogy, are up to DMIm. Disappointed by the impact of the last big trade fair, Drupa, at the start of 1990, Linotype pins great hopes on Imprinta next February. Both Drupa, the world's biggest exhibition in the industry, cov- ering both printing and pre- press equipment, and Imprinta (pre-press only) take place in Dilsseldorf. However, the group has already brought out its first \"synergy product,\" the Lino- tronic 630, a high-quality laser image-setter. The company hopes its order books will start to revive fol- lowing the introduction of the new product in June. Last year, Hell's order book slumped by around 30 per cent. Linotype fared better, with only a slight downturn - the merger took effect from Octo- ber last year - so that group turnover (including three months with Hell) was 18 per cent higher in 1990 at DM806m. Net profits were 42 per cent lower after reorganisation costs, and the dividend was cut from DM15 to DM13 a share. C- oming on top of the US recession, the Gulf cri- a sis put a severe damper on demand. Linotype's UK sub- sidiary, also responsible for the Middle East, thus suffered a double blow since the UK recession was already hurting sales. In July 1990, the UK reported a big order from Kuwait and said it only needed a letter of credit. \"Instead of a letter of credit, along came Saddam Hussein,\" says Mr Kummer ruefully. However, even when busi- ness conditions improve, the going is likely to remain tough. The pace of innovation has hotted up, and Mr Kummer says the merger puts the two companies in a better position to react rapidly to technologi- cal advances. \"In our industry, everything changes every six to 12 months.\" In the stock market, where Linotype has impressed inves- tors with its strong earnings performance since its flotation in 1987, the merger has been well received. \"The two compa- nies form a strategic alliance straight out of the text book,\" says Mr Andreas Insam, an analyst with Bank in Liechten- stein (Frankfurt). Text book conditions rarely apply in business. Linotype- Hell is now having to write its own script - how to make a merger work in a recession and yield new profits during the ensuing recovery. It is still on the first few chapters.",

   "text_content" : "ARDINE Fleming, the Hong Kong-based mer- chant bank, plans to move into new markets, buoyed by two years of above-average profits growth. Mr Alan Smith, managing director, says JS is one of the world's most profitable mer- chant banks. Last year's net profits of HK$577m (US$74.35m) translate into a return on equity of 57.2 per cent, compared with an aver- age 10 to 15 per cent for UK and US merchant and invest- ment banks. \"We have chosen to operate in the Far East, which is still an area of above average growth, our management is here, rather than in London or New York and I think people realise we are committed to Asia,\" Mr Smith said. JS has changed the structure of its business since the mid- 1980s. It has increasingly tar- geted fund management, which does not rely on shareholders' funds and moved away from corporate finance work in Hong Kong. It was among the first stockbrokers into the Jap- anese and Hong Kong markets, but its position has been eroded as other international companies have moved in. Mr Smith refuses to give profit breakdowns, but says about 40 per cent of annual revenue comes from fund man- agement, 30 per cent from broking, 15 per cent from capi- tal markets, including corpo- rate finance and 15 per cent from Joint ventures in Thai- land and Indonesia. Hong Kong and Tokyo, where F has broking and fund management licences, are about equal in terms of contri- bution to gross revenue. Other Asian offices are not yet signif- icant. Competitors in Hong Kong believe fund management makes up more than 75 per cent of profits and the propor- tion would be higher if some stockbroking profits related to fund management were included. Funds under management have almost doubled since the start of 1988 and total US$8.5bn. Much of the new money came from Taiwan, after individuals there were allowed to invest overseas in 1988 and from single country funds which enjoyed two years of spectacular growth before the Gulf war. Mr Smith says international institutions still provide JS with about 35 per cent of funds under management. Hong Kong institutions provide a further 15 per cent. JS was set up in 1970 as a joint venture between Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong con glomerate controlled by the Keswick family, and Rlobert Fleming of London. Initially the company managed small amounts of money and under- took corporate finance work for the Jardine group. As ftmd management expanded, JS used its links with interna- Lional institutions which were oing into Asia to start a stock- rng and research function. Mr Smith says JS has largely mioved out of corporate finance work in Hong Kong because cf ressure on margins as more companies move in and is looking at corporate finance in less established markets such as Indonesia, where fees can be double those in Hong Kong. -C ritics say the move is I not surprising given the - Jardine Matheson group, JF's largest client, is trying to distance itself from HIong Kong ahead of 1997. With companies in the group seek- ing to move their primary list- ings to London, Mr Smith agrees JF's involvement will decline as Robert Fleming's rises. Corporate finance work in Asia, especially with new issues, is increasingly flowing out of banking relationships. But JF's banking arm, Jardine Fleming, is too small to qualify for a foreign-owned full hank. ing licence in Hong Kong. This prevents JS from becoming involved with munal Chinese companies and their increas- inly rich managers seeking rivate banking services. JS, along with other Indoni anka, Is setting up a..reional network of oMes desi agned to draw on lberallsato n within individual markets. They could also provide a framework for financial services between Asian countries. Mr Smith says he is consid- ering opening in India, Sri Lanka and Vietnam and would alo like to return to Singa- pore. The Monetary Authorit of Singapore closed down JFs merchant banking operation in 1984 after the company had a disagreement with the govern- ment. But moving into often tightly regulated markets is expensive. Mr Smith says JS will lose money this year in Indonesia and Korea, where it was one of the first four for- eigners to be given a securities branch licence in March. Last October JS, along with Warburg Investment Trust Management, was also among the first allowed into the Y45,000bn (US$328.8bn) Japa- nese investment trust market. However, because of the prob- lems in the Japanese stock market and the costs of starting up the business, Mr Smith expects to see at least three years of losses.",

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster HUTCHISON Telecom, the aggressive mobile communica- tions group, has moved into continental Europe by buying a majority shareholding in ABC Telekom, the German mobile communications retailer. Hutchison, which is based in Hong Kong and owned by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa group, is looking to move into other European mar- kets, including France, Italy and The Netherlands. ABC Telekom supplies porta- ble and car phones for the Ger- man cellular network, and has been awarded a service licence for one of the two new German networks, due to begin operations this year. The com- pany also has retail outlets in several German cities. Hutchison released no details on the price or size of its stake, but views Germany as vital to its planned expan- sion into Europe. Mr Rick Siemens, group managing director, said recently that, by the end of the decade, Hutchison hoped to be a leading force in 20 to 30 coun- tries in Europe and Asia, offer- ing a full range of mobile ser- vices, from radio paging to PCN and digital cellular phones. In July, Hutchison com- pleted several acquisitions in the UK when it bought Micro- tel Communications, a per- sonal communications net- work, from a consortium led by British Aerospace. BAe took a 30 per cent stake in Hutchison Telecom (UK) after the deal.",

   "text_content" : "Renong hits pre-tax profit target RENONG, the Malaysian holding group controlled by the ruling United Malays National Organisation party, has reported a M$S13m operat- ing loss in its first full-year result as a new conglomerate, writes Lim Siong Boon in Kuala Lumpur. But M$93m in investment and other income from associ- ates gave it a pre-tax profit of M$80m, within the forecast made early last year. Renong was then resurrected from a tiny mining company into a corporate empire with main interests in banking, finance, construction, publish- ing and properties. It controls 6 per cent of the Kuala Lumpur's stock narket capitalisation of M$6S1bn. Group profit after tax and minorities stood at M$60m, or nearly 6 Malaysian cents a share compared with 1 cent a year ago. Extraordinary items added M$618m for an attribut- able profit of M$678m. United Engineers, the con- struction group and part of the Renong conglomerate, reported a mid-year improvement in operating profit of 64 per cent, to M$61m on M$186m in turn- over, compared with M$143m in the 1990 period. Investment and profits of associates added M$19m for M$80m in pre-tax profit. No dividend was announced. Anglo American of South Africa said on Monday it had increased its stake in Austra- lia's Normandy Poseidon to 19.8 per cent from around 15 per cent, AP-DJ reports in Adelaide. The company paid around A$20.4m (US$16m) to lift its holding in the Austra- lian miner of gold and other resources. Anglo American had previ- ously received permission from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board to move to 20 per cent, and was widely believed to have done so last week when TNT said it had sold 10 per cent of the com- pany, and granted an option to sell a further 10 per cent. Under Australian corporate law, Anglo American cannot raise its stake further without making a bid for all Normandy Poseidon which is controlled by Australian accountant and businessman Robert Champion de Crespigny. Anglo American said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange it bought 930,000 Normandy Poseidon shares at A$1.24 each on June 25. It bought an additional 16m shares at A$1.20 on August 29. n Australasian liquor and gro- cery group Magnum Corpora- tion has announced a 55 per cent profit fall to NZ25.24m (US$14.5m) after tax and extraordinaries in the year to June 30, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Directors say the group had encountered some of the worst trading conditions in Australia and New Zealand since the 1930s depression. Operating profit fell 8 per cent to NZ$84.9m, from NZ$92.72m. Interest costs rose 59 per cent to NZ$32.31m after borrowing to expand grocery assets in New Zealand and liquor and hotel operations in Australia. Since balance date the com- pany had boosted its share- holding in Wilson Neill to 49 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "Iy rn'lilp uawim in iape i own STRONG rhodium prices helped Impala Platinum, the world's second largest plati- num producer, lift attributable earnings by 25 per cent in the year to June 1990. Turnover rose from R2.09bn ($727.3m) to R2.27bn and income from platinum mining operations increased tc R762.1m from R638.2m. Attrib- utable income was R311.8m compared with R250.5m. Mr Brian Gilbertson, chair- man, said average rhodium prices had increased to $3,715 from $1,384 the previous year. Unit production costs rose 11 per cent to R1,295 for every ounce of platinum refined and the average platinum price dropped 11 per cent to R1,102 per ounce. Mr Gilbertson said that, if weakness in the platinum price continued, the group would not be able to maintain its perfor- mance in the current financial year. He also said that this would force South African pro- ducers to revise their expan- sion plans. Earnings per share rose to 509 cents from 410 cents and the dividend was lifted 10 per cent to 275 cents per share. * Bankorp, South Africa's fifth largest banking group, achieved a R433m turnround from loss into profit in the year to June. Net taxed income was R64.5m compared with a loss of R368m last year when the bank was forced to take massive write-offs. The group's return on assets is 0.19 per cent com- pared with the 0.8 to 0.9 per cent of leading competitors."

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foter in Hong Kong HONGKONG Land, part of the Jardine Matheson rop and one of Hong Kong's largest landlords, has completed a sel-off of non-core asets with the sale of three properties for HK$L3Ibn (US$176m). The co anysaid It would ell two pi arcades and a retail and office complexs to Chinese Estates, the main listed vehicle for the Lan brothers. All three properties lie outside the colony's central financial district, where all of Hongkong Land's portfolio is now located. The sale follows the disposal last year of the World Trade Centre for HK$1.72bn, and the sale earlier this year of four shopping centres. Hongkong Land said it was is prepared to sell non-core assets if prices were good. The policy has been inter- preted, however, by some ana- lysts as suggesting Jardine Matheson is preparing to sell Hongkong Land and move out of Hong Kong. Last week Jar- dine Matheson shares fell nearly 10 per cent on reports that the company was about to delist from Hong Kong and move its primary listing to London. Jardine and its controlling shareholders, the Keswick family, say they are worried about Chinese interference in Hong Kong after 1997. The company has been in negotia- tions with the Securities and Futures Commission, the over- all market watchdog, to seek a compromise solution which would see Jardine's primary listing moving to London but trading of the group's shares continue in Hong Kong. Ninety-nine per cent of its property portfolio is in Hong Kong.",

   "text_content" : "By Lim Slong Hoon in Kuala Lumpur GOLDEN Hope, Malaysia's second largest plantation group, plans to raise M$211.5m (USS 76m) via a rights issue. The cash call reflects on the group's steady deterioration in liquidity and profitability, par- ticularly between 1985 and the year ended March 1991. During the period, turnover fell from MSl.lbn to MS398m; earnings declined from 29 cents a share to about 5 cents; and working capital from a current asset surplus declined to 67 per cent of current liabil- ities. Golden Hope said the issue comprises 211.5m convertible five-year 7'% per cent prefer- ence shares which will be offered on the basis of one share for every four ordinary shares held. On conversion, by March 1997 at three for two, the group's capital share will rise from M$846m to MS987m. The issue was necessary, said the company, to finance investments in cocoa grinding, production of rubber and wood products, and property devel- opment."

Prospects The slightly lower level of Group profits for the half-year was principally due to a downturn within Cathay Pacific Airways, which more than offset strong performances elsewhere, notably in the property and industries divisions. The environment in which the airline is operating is, however, slowly becoming more favourable and its results should improve in the second half-year. The growth seen in investment property income should continue, with higher overall profits being achieved within the property division for the full year. Better results are expected from the remaining divisions, with the industries division in particular likely to show a sharp improvement over the previous year. I expect that dividends for the full year will be not less than those paid in respect of 1990. The interim dividends are payable on 9th October 1991 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 30th September 1991; the share registers will be closed from 26th September 1991 to 30th September 1991, both dates inclusive.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb JAPANESE government bonds rallied strongly as hopes of a cut in interest rates pushed the benchmark futures contract to its highest level since January 1990. The market is waiting for the US August employment report and the Bank of Japan's GOVERNMENT BONDS quarterly economic uTankan\" report, both of which are released on Friday. A poor US employment report could prompt the US Federal Reserve to ease inter- est rates, and would put pres- sure on the Bank of Japan to cut its official discount rate, especially if the Tankan report provides further evidence of an economic slowdown and an easing of inflationary pressure. The Bank of Japan has also come under pressure to lower interest rates in view of the recent weakness in the stock market. The yield on the benchmark No 129 Japanese government bond, which closed at 6.335 per cent on Friday, opened yester- day at 6.35 per cent and closed at 6.29 per cent. The benchmark futures con- tract reached a high of 98.30. * THE UK government bond market jumped at yesterday's opening on news that the Con- servative Party had pulled ahead of the Labour Party in the opinion polls for the first time in six months. The survey, conducted by Mori for The Sunday Times, showed the Conservatives with 42 per cent in the polls against Labour's 40 per cent. Furthermore, the survey showed increased confidence about the recovery of the UK economy. The benchmark 11% per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 112k and traded at 11211 by late afternoon to yield 9.85 per cent. The rally in the gilt market was helped by sterling's strength in the foreign exchange markets. Traders said that the market was expecting the Bank of England to announce further gilt issues in the next couple of weeks. * CONTINENTAL European markets edged up yesterday in thin trading, regaining some of the ground lost on Friday. However, volumes were low as US investors were on holiday. The German government bond mhrket rose in thin trad- ing and the London Interna- tional Financial Futures Exchange bund futures con- tract, which opened at 84.83, closed near the day's high of 85.10. The Bundesbank injected liquidity into the market, alloc- ating funds mostly at 9 per cent at a two-day securities repurchase tender. The tender gives the market a temporary liquidity injection ahead of the usual one-month and two- month tenders due on Wednes- day. In addition, the Bundesbank announced that the German bond consortium would meet on Thursday to set the terms on a new bond for the German Post Authority. STHE US markets were closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday.

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb PORTUGAL and Spain were the top-performing government bond markets in August, pro- viding a return of 4.49 per cent and 3.41 per cent respec- tively for sterling-based inves- tors. The Iberian markets rallied on hopes of lower inflation and falls in interest rates, and such expectations have drawn for- eign investors to be active par- ticipants. Returns for dollar-based investors for Portugal and Spain were 4.4 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The fig- ures were given by Kemper Investment Management Com- pany (Kimco), which compares the returns for 21 international bond markets. However, the Portuguese bond market faced an unex- pected setback in July when the Portuguese central bank announced that foreign inves- tors would not be permitted to buy Portuguese floating rate notes until the beginning of 1992. The move was intended to curb speculative capital flows. As a result, the Portuguese government bond market was the worst performer in July, but picked up the following month as investors realised that the market was underval- ued and that the inflation out- look would improve, according to Kimco. In Spain, the central bank cut the official intervention rate from 12.75 per cent to 12.6 per cent on August 23, the third cut this year. Canada, Australia and the US followed the Iberian mar- kets in the performance league with returns of 3.25 per cent, 2.72 per cent and 2.62 per cent respectively in sterling terms in August.",

   "text_content" : "By Simon London NATIONAL Bank of Hungary is expected to launch its antici- pated Ecu200m five-year issue in the international market today, despite continued unrest in neighbouring Yugoslavia and political upheaval in the Soviet Union. The deal, lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, will be priced at a yield of about 12% to 12%/ per cent. A final decision on pricing will be made this morning. Participants in the deal have been pre-selling the issue for some days and report good demand from investors despite the political uncertainties in eastern Europe. However, syn- dicate managers are not pre- dicting an easy sell-out and many are expecting to work hard to place their allocations. Intermediaries are expecting a flurry of deals in other cur- rency sectors this week, with the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Ecu and yen sectors tipped for more new issues. However, yesterday's activ- ity was subdued, with US mar- kets shut for the Labor Day holiday. The main interest cen- tred on a Â£100m five-year issue by Skandia Capital, the fund- ing arm of the Swedish insur- ance group. Lead managed by S.G. War- burg, the issue carries a cou- pon of 11 per cent and was re-offered to investors at a INTERNATIONAL BONDS fixed price of par. At this level, the yield spread over UK gov- ernment bonds is 80 basis points. The lead manager reported good demand from continental European investors attracted by the well-known name. The company is rated double-A by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the US credit-rating agencies. Against the back- ground of a rising gilts market, the yield spread narrowed to 77 basis points by late afternoon. Although demand for ster- ling paper remains buoyant, supply of new bonds may be lmted by the lack of currency swaps opportunities. Skandia requires sterling funding because of its subsidiary, Skan- dia Life. Eutelsat, the European tele- communications organisation, came with its first issue for almost a year, a Ecu75m three- year offering lead managed by Nomura International. * Union Bank of Finland has set up a Eculbn Euro medium- term note programme, arranged by Merrill Lynch International. The programme allows for the issue of senior and subordinated paper in 11 currencies, with maturities ranging from a year to 30 years. It carries an Aal rating for senior notes from Moody's Investors Service and a sin- gle-A rating from Standard & Poor's. S&P downgraded UBFs senior rating from AA- in July, citing a deterioration in the bank's domestic operating environment.",

The company said that the facility had secured the financ- ing necessary for the car com- pany's capital expenditure pro- gramme. Earlier in the year, a SKr5.5bn ($873m) package of new equity and subordinated debt was received by Saab Automobile from its joint owners to cover losses and help fund planned new models."

   "text_content" : "By simon Lonaom THE DOLLAR, riding high In the foreign exchange markets during 1991, could face weak- aes in the latter part of the year, according to a survey of international Investors con- ducted by Merrill Lynch. The quarterly survey, car- ried out by the investment home during July and August, found that 60 per cent of inter- national investors now feel that their investment portfo- lies are overweight in dollars. This is more than double the percentage a year ago. In contrast, 66 per cent of investors felt that they were underweight in D-Marks, against 22 per cent in the autumn of 1990. The results suggest that Investors could switch funds out of the US cur- rency, possibly into D-Mark denominated assets. However, the extent and timing of any shift into D-Marks could be decided by political developments in the Soviet Union. The 25 per cent fall in German equity prices on August 19, the start day of the failed coup attempt against Mr Gorbachev, revealed German financial asset prices to be highly sensi- tive to political events in the east. Against this, a transforma- tion of the Soviet economy along market lines would ben- efit Germany and western Europe at the expense of the US. Mr Michael Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, commented that \"the new world order will exert a negative influence on the dollar\". However, he also noted that real interest rate, growth and inflation patterns were all pos- itive for the dollar in compari- son with other currencies. For this reason, the firm is predict- ing a slow build-up of down- ward pressure on the US cur- rency rather than a sudden correction. The survey is positive for sterling, with 61 per cent of investors now feeling under- weight in the currency, against 24 per cent in the autumn of last year. Only 11 per cent of Investors felt overweight in sterling assets.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "SN t search for fast-grow- ingfee-based income, Can- ada's banks, trust compa- nies and life insurers are aggressively elbowing their way into the mutual funds business. The financial institutions, most of which took little inter- est in mutual funds five years ago, now make up six of the top 10 distributors, with a share of almost 20 per cent of the market. Mr John Vivash, president of CIBC Securities, predicts that the banks and trusts will have a 70 per'cent market share by the end of the decade, while Mr Bruce Walters, vice-president for mutual funds at Royal Bank of Canada, says \"mutual funds are a key strategic prior- ity\" for his bank. The banks' and trusts' exten- sive branch networks and the insurance companies' sales- forces give these institutions resources which only the big- gest of the traditional mutual- fund distributors can match. Royal Bank has licensed a mutual fund salesforce of 3,800 in its branches. That is more than twice as many sales rep- resentatives as at Winnipeg- based Investors Group, which is Canada's biggest fund distributor, measured by assets. The banks have concen- trated on money market funds. But they are increasingly eye- ing equity and bond products, uAMA 'S TOP, ITUAL - amM I d i-nÂ« Investors Group Royal Trust Can. Imperial Bank of Commerce rimark Royal Bank of Canada AGF Management Templeton International Bank of Montreal Laurentian Funds Management Canada Trust Swce: InvaWmMnt Fundi Inst\"ua of@ Canad which normally produce higher fees. The financial institutions' foray into mutual funds is encouraged by predictions that this segment of the Canadian financial services market could be one of the fastest-growing during the next decade. Only about 13 per cent of Canadian adults currently avest in mutual funds, which is half the penetration of the US industry. The gap is expec- ted to close rapidly as growing numbers of small investors entrust their money to profes- sional managers, and as the financial institutions' sales- forces reach more people. Mr Selwyn Kossuth, presi- dent of the Investment Funds Institute of Canada (IFIC), whose members account for about 80 per cent of the indus- try's C$42bn (US$37bn) in assets, says \"we're in for huge growth, barring a disaster like the failure of a major US money market fund\". The optimism is borne out by recent experience. Like their counterparts elsewhere, Canadian mutual funds sus fered sizeable redemptions after the 1987 stock market crash. But investors have returned en masse since mid- 1989. The flow into funds managed by IFIC members doubled to C$6bn in the first six months of 1991, compared with a year ear- lier. The industry is also pulling in plenty of new customers. The number of shareholder accounts has climbed by 14 per cent in the 'past year to more than 3m at the end of June. The experienced distributors acknowledge that a shake-out in the industry is inevitable, but they question how power- ful a force the banks will be. Mr Arthur Mauro, chief executive of Investors Group, says that \"our entire structure and approach has been directed towards eventually meeting the banks\". Investors, which expects C$2.5bn in sales this year, plans to boost its salesforce from 1,800 to 2,500 by 1995. Mr Mauro doubts that in the long run banks and insurance companies can be as adroit as more secialised distributors in selling mutual funds. He predicts that, although bank- managed funds may pull in business in a bull market, they will fare more poorly than oth- ers when the bears appear. \"No one expects money in a bank to drop in value,\" he says. As for insurance companies, Mr Mauro notes that \"they're great liability managers, but they haven't seemed to catch fire on asset management\". Sales commissions on insur- ance policies are also more juicy than on mutual funds. A scheme by Investors to pro mote mutual-fund sales through its sister company Great-West Life (both are con trolled by Montreal's Power Financial Corp) has met little enthusiasm from the Great Vest salesforce. Some do not see the banks and trust companies as a threat. Mr Terence Stone, pres ident of Bolton Tremblay Funds, a mid-sized manager, notes that \"they will add respectability to the product line. They will open up a much wider market for mutual funds.\" While that is taking place, however, many fund managers which sell through stockbro kers and small, specialised dis tributors seem likely to disap- pear. The field will increasingly be dominated by financial institutions and a handful of the biggest fund mraragers.",

It had been decided to sell the exchange late last year, and market stability was needed. The NZFOE board had rec- ommended that its members accept the NZ$5.5m offer from London, but Mr Ward said that because final documentation had not been received, the board was evaluating the Syd- ney one. The chairman of the London FOX, Mr Saxon Tate, said he strongly opposed the Austra- lian move and doubted whether it was a genuine com- mercial interest. Mr Les Hosking, chairman of the Sydney exchange, said there was synergy between the two bodies. Eight companies were members of both exchanges, and a link would allow them to specialise in products \"almost exclusively peculiar\" to Australia and New Zealand."

   "text_content" : "NORWAY is cautiously optimistic that its troubled banks will recover, after los- ing NKr4Obn ($5.9bn) in the last five years and public con- fidence, Reuter reports from Oslo. \"I have reason to believe that we will gradually see a positive development, but the major uncertainty is [still] linked to the property mar- ket,\" said the finance minister, Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen. State cash is propping up two large banks to help them survive soaring loan losses and reduced credibility. Norwegian banks have lost billions of kroner on loans to those ranging from home-buy- ers to fish farmers. \"We have lost about NKr4Obn over the past four to five years. Both banks and businesses neglected the equity capital factor in the mid-1980s,\" said Mr Johnsen. New capital adequacy rules are also straining the banks. They must increase total equity to at least 8 per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items by the end of 1992. To help banks meet these requirements, the minority Labour government this year set up a NKr5bn Government Bank Insurance Fund. Nearly half the fund has been granted as loans to Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, the country's second and third largest com- mercial banks.",

   "text_content" : "By Victowl Gri Grlh in Sao Paulo PRESIDENT FERNANDO Collor de Mello of Brazil and President Cesar Gaviria of Col- ombia met yesterday in Bra- silia to discuss a plan calling for the retention of 10 per cent of world coffee production in an effort to prop up prices. The Brazilian government yesterday was expected to give \"moral\" but no financial sup- port to the plan. According to Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, president of the Brazilian Fed- eration of Coffee Exporters, the Collor administration's assent is essential if only to prevent the release of the government's stock of 17m bags. The Ministry of Economics was expected yesterday to announce the release of 0 Cr6Sbn ($144m) coffee indus d try financing, blocked under the inflation-fighting Collo- Plan last year. if any money is g allotted to the retention t scheme, it will probably come n from the newly-released funds. It is still uncertain whether t producers will be able to go 3 ahead with the plan without the government's financial : support. *With Brazil's , announcement last week that it would not advocate the ke return to an international cos- t fee agreement, the market's t hopes for higher prices are s pinned on the success of the coffee retention scheme. Mr s Francisco Rezek, Brazil's for- :o eign minister, said that the - country would oppose a return to a world accord uilesi BniaiL was offered a quota in excess of 28 per cent. The chances that the country will be offered a higher quota, however, are considered slim. Brazil is also fiercely opposed to a scheme put for- ward by coffee-consuming countries, which would impose quality \"selectivity\" on an international agreement. Th- rule would favour the \"mild\" coffees of Central America and Colombia preferred by consum- ers. Colombia and Brazil are expected to present a united front at the meeting of the International Coffee Organisa- tion later this month. Without the adhesion of both countries i the bujest prduces of Sin the world an international s accord would be imossble. The Brisllan cofee mark r' isoptimistic thatven withut government funds, producers Ly willobtain the credit necessar - to put the retention scheme i into action. \"I believe od ie er can get the ftnds - domestic and international i banks,\" said Mr Aranha Neto \" \"Government fliancing would d help, but it is not necessary.\" - The coffee retention scheme, originally proposed by Colom re bia, has been accepted by key d representatives of the coffee i sector in Brazil and Central America. These countries are t now trying to pull African and Asfan producers into the plan.",

   "text_content" : "Sarita Kendall examines Colombia's attitude to price support RAZIL AND Colombia are the key producing countries in any interna- tional coffee negotiation, and President Cesar Gaviria's visit to Brazil is a crucial step towards defining the frame- work for meetings later this month in London. For the first time since the collapse in 1989 of the International Coffee Organisation's price-support- ing export quota system, the two biggest exporters appear to have found common ground in the scheme to withhold produc- tion in order to try and stimu- late price increases. Colombia has survived two years of free market trading better than most: coffee export- ers as a whole lost an esti- mated US$5.lbn or 27 per cent of their earnings from 1989 to 1991, compared with the last two years of the pact; but Col- ombia has been particularly successful in compensating for lower prices with greater vol- umes, and coffee income fell by only 17 per cent in the period. However, the financial strain on the national coffee fund, which has cushioned the effect of low international prices on local growers, is enormous. The idea of retaining 10 per cent of world export produc- tion apparently arose during a meeting between Colombian and Brazilian coffee producers in Bogota, when it became clear that Brazil would not even consider a return to a quota system. Colombia still derives nearly a quarter of its export income from coffee and has always been at the fore- front in negotiating agree- ments. Although some coffee exporters are not as enthusias- tic about a new pact as they used to be, all sectors endorse the retention scheme. \"We do not want to manipu- late the market and create a scarcity of coffee. We just want prices to be a little better. As prices improve, coffee could be gradually released on to the rresiaents Louor oe nmeuo or urazu vien) ano uavma or Colombia represent the two biggest coffee producers market,\" said Mr Diego Pizano, international adviser at Seder acafe, the Colombian coffee growers' federation. \"This should be accomplished with international co-operation, not as a unilateral producer's action. It could be done within the ICO framework.\" So far the withholding scheme has proved unexpect- edly popular. At the end of last week in Bogota the president of Guatemala pledged his sup port for any course designed to raise prices. Other Central American countries have already shown interest, and together, the Latin American producers represent some 70 per cent of world exports. Ini tial scepticism about finance and controls is being whittled away as concrete proposals nshow how these problems can be tackled. Colombia, with abundant international reserves and a tradition of managing large stocks, would have no diffi- culty holding back 1.4m bags, representing about 10 per cent of its exportable production. US commercial banks are apparently prepared to make loans to Central American nations for retention with cos- fee as the guarantee. Though many details still have to be hammered out, the simplicity of a uniform 10 per cent sacri- fice by all producers has greater appeal than the fight to secure quotas. This year's coffee crop, fore- cast at more than 14m bags, shows just how well protected the Colombian growers are. \"They haven't felt the effect of the end of the pact as others have. There was an 11 per cent price increase in March and there's supposed to be another in October - but this looks difficult and the real price will fall further,\" said Mr Hernando Chovil of Expocafe, the coffee co-operative exporting group. \"Our clients say they want quality, but how can producers go on investing in quality if prices are down?\" The large harvest reflects good weather and greater pro- ductivity, with the area planted with coffee remaining stable at about l.lm hectares. The lower yield traditional variety, grown under shade, now contributes less than a quarter of output, and more and more rust-resistant Colo- plian caturra plantations are coming into production. While growers would be most unlikely to cut down coffee trees and turn to other crops, another drop in the real domes- tic price would affect invest- Tment in fertiliser and in the care of trees, reducing yields. Although the Federacafe has had to trim most of its develop- ment programmes in the coffee regions, the Federation has created a new ecological fund to finance reafforestation, eco- logical education and the pro- tection of streams and water sheds. The fund's resources come mainly from the saving on a 4 per cent EC coffee tax, which was lifted by the EC ir recognition of the cost of the war against drug trafficking. As a result of subsidising the price paid to growers, the National Coffee Fund's assets have dropped from US$1.8bn to $l.lbn and the fund as far less liquid than it was two years ago, says Mr Pizano. In 1990 coffee exports reached 13.9m bags, bringing in nearly UJS$1.5bn. This year's export forecast is down to 13.3m bags, principally because consumer countries' stocks are so high. Colombia's share of the world market, which was about 1- per cent during the last year of the pact, has risen to 18 per cent. Colombian exporters are optimistic about the retention scheme, and some believe it could become a semi-perma- nent arrangement to replace the coffee pact. However, they do not expect it to boost prices back to pact levels; most would be satisfied with a modest increase to cover rises in pro duction, transport and market ing costs, and ensure a stable income for growers.",

However, there was no market reaction to news that scientists at Amsterdam University plan to test a copper-chrome catalytic converter in a car by the end of this year. The US Labor Day holiday left other metals markets quiet in London. Nickel continued to retreat on the LME on stale long liquidation. The selling was influenced by the failure to test upside resistance levels and the absence of consumer interest. Copper and aluminium were steady; stocks figures for both are seen rising today.

Researchers reported find- ins these threatened and angered species recently in or near the Flambeau River, about a mile from where the company plans an outlet for a drain pipe. So a US circuit judge has imposed a preliminary injunc. tion to stop all work - except that which is environmentaly necessary - at the mine untl S0 days after the Wisconsin state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has issued a revised environmental impact statement. The revised statement could take up to nine months to pre- pare, according to the RTZ Corporation, the world's larg- est mining company and, through Kennecott Corpora- tion of the US, ultimate owner of the Flambeau project. Work started in July on access roads and clearing waste materials above the rich Flambeau copper deposit. First nipments were scheduled to tart in the spring of 1992 and he mine's 1.9m tonnes of ore was expected to be worked out within six years. Mr Larry Mercando, vice president and general man- ager of Flambeau Mining, said tat \"despite disagreeing with the court's ruling, we will, of course, continue to respect the laws of this state and abide by the ruling. We are, however, exploring our legal options.\" The state DNR gave the go-ahead for the mine, much to the dismay of some environ- mentalists, last year after con- cluding in an environmental impact statement that there were no endangered or threat- ened species near the mine site. Judge George Northrup, granting the injunction, suggested that the DNR's 1990 impact statement did not ade- quately consider the possibil- ity that such species might be affected. His order followed a civil action against the state DNR -y the Sierra Club, a group of US environmental activists, and the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chip- pewa natives. The Chippewa have argued for some years that the mine could spoil fish- ing by polluting the Flambeau river, a tributary of the Chip- pewa river, which drains into the Mississippi. Chippewa Chief Galashkibos even car- ried the protest to the RTZ -mnual meeting in London in May last year.",

   "text_content" : "By Kenneth Gooding THE SOVIET Union has virtually stopped importing bauxite, the raw material for aluminium production, because of foreign currency short- ages. The country instead is relying on huge stockpiles of the material and output from its own high-cost mines, according to Mr Ulysses Kyr- iacopoulos, managing director of Bauxites Parnasse Mining, the larg- est bauxite mining company in Greece. US markets were closed yesterday for Labor Day He says that the Soviets have at least three years' supply of bauxite in strategic stocks and possibly as much as five years. However, material left in the stockpiles is relatively low grade, a is most of the output from the Soviet mines, Mr Kyriacopoulos suggests. This is causing compica- tions along the production chain - the bauxite is smelted nto shaluas, an intermediate material which cannot be stared, and then treind into alumintum.

   "text_content" : "Retailers are passing on only a fraction of the cuts B ACK IN May I was mod- erately optimistic about our pigs. The Average All Pigs Price, which is the basis for many UK sale con- tracts and is calculated by the Meat and Livestock Commis- sion from a wide range of mar. ket outlets, had made a steady recovery from the disastrous levels of the winter and appeared set to provide reason- able returns for the rest of the year. Pig numbers, both in Britain and in Europe, were relatively static and there was no sign of serious deterioration in that position. -n June, however, British pig prices suddenly went into free-fall and they have been dropping ever since; although, to be fair, there are some indi- cations that the decline may be bottoming out. Market prices for live pigs over the last two weeks have improved margin ally, but the AAPP is still more than 30 per cent lower than it was in May and pig producers like me are losing between Â£1C and Â£12 on each pig sold. Collapsing pig prices are hardly news, of course - it has always been a \"boom and bust\" market. Usually, how- ever, the reason for the insta- bility is self-inflicted by the industry itself. Pig producers are notorious for expanding production as profits improve, over-supplying the market, and destroying the very profits they seek. This time the situation is rather different. There are sev- eral contributory factors, including a glut of lamb on the market at very low prices all summer, the result of a rise in UK sheep numbers over recent years. Lamb has been a bar- gain for consumers, many of whom have clearly chosen it instead of pork, as a result of which the price of pigmeat has been undermined. The Danes, whose bacon and pork exported to Britain have traditionally been market price leaders, have suddenly started offering supplies at discounts against their list prices. Danish bacon has, for the first time I can remember, been wholesaling at lower prices than British bacon. That is not, I suspect, a situation the Danes relish but one forced on them by their intermittent problems with exports to Japan. On top of all this, pigmeat put in to cold store last winter during the last depression in prices to cash in on the Euro- pean Community's limited Aids to Private Storage scheme - designed to relieve pressure on over-supplied markets - has been coming out of storage to be re-presented on the ever \"more depressed summer mar k:et. And then there is the recession - for there is no doubt that people are buying ess, and that includes food FARMERS VIEWPOINT By David Richardson not to mention the growth of vegetarianism. But Britain's pig producers believe there is one more sig- nificant factor. As the British Pig Association pointed out last month, while average ex- farm prices for pigs have declined, at some markets by up to 40 per cent since May, retail prices have dropped by a mere 2 or 3 per cent. Retailers argue, of course, that it does no one any good for prices to fluctuate. All that does, they say, is alienate con- sumers when they go up again. There is a certain logic in their policy. Indeed I have always taken the view that within rea- son it is far better for the retailer to sell for as much as the market will stand. Pulling down margins only makes it more difficult for retailers to pay a decent price to produc- ers. However, there has to be a limit. For when the difference between the cost of the raw material and the price in the shops becomes as large as it has with pigmeat over the last few months, it has to be regarded as a denial of the operation of market forces. Furthermore it could be argued that a significant reduction in prices in butchers' shops and supermarkets would, had it taken place, have stimulated demand and could have speeded a recovery. This has not happened and substantial losses on every pig continue. Inevitably farmers blame the supermarkets most. After all they claim to sup- ply over 60 per cent of all the food consumed in the UK and more than half of the meat. In truth, however, pricing policies adopted by family butchers are very similar. And although the entire retail trade tends to hold sell- ing prices steady while whole- sale prices fall, the same is sel- dom true when raw material prices rise. When that happens you cannot see their tails for dust as they scurry around their shelves raising retail prices in response to what they claim are their increasing costs. Clearly this current example of pigmeat, which can only be described as an excessive mark-up of prices at a time when the supermarket indus- try is about to be subjected to scrutiny by the House of Com- mons Select Committee for Agriculture, is a source of embarrassment to the multi- ples. Their public relations departments have in fact been busy denying that a problem exists. \"We have reduced pig- meat prices\", they claim, and on examination this proves to be true. Look a little closer, however, and you find that in most cases this only applies to a few slow moving cuts such as belly bacon. To compensate, price increases have usually been made on faster selling parts of pig. Indeed for some reason that pig producers can never under- stand, pork seems to be unique among meats in the way it is priced. Moreover it sometimes appears that pigmeat prices are held at higher levels than nec- essary in order to subsidise beef and lamb. If this is the case it should be a matter for concern, for British consumers eat more pork and bacon than any other meat - an annual average of 46.5 lb a head. Meanwhile, according to the Meat and Livestock Commis- sion, farmers are at present receiving an average of about 38p a lb deadweight for pigs while the average retail price of pigmeat is 134p a lb. There is of course a waste element to be allowed for such as the head, the bones and so on together with some processing costs. But given that most butchers claim to use almost every part of the pig except its squeal, there would appear to be room for a fair margin between those figures. \"There is\", said the chair- man of Food From Britain the other day, \"an overriding requirement for meat produc- ers and processors to consider themselves as one team in the food chain. . . retailer and caterer demand for high vol- umes of product supplied regu- larly and to a consistent speci- fication emphasises the need for collaborative ventures\". Mr Paul Judge was at the time referring to a report by his organisation into the large and rising food trade gap - the balance between what is imported and what is exported - of some Â£5.1bn per year. Of that Â£1.2bn is represented by meat. He is right of course, and I share his concern, as indeed should the government. But when one member or sector in the potential team is as power- ful and ruthless as some of the supermarkets, it is small won- der that opportunities for import substitution, never mind potential export possibili- ties so vital to the UK's bal- ance of payments, are not being fully exploited.",

Speculation about a possible - easing of French monetary pol- icy left the French franc at the bottom of the system, but there - was no change in official rates j yesterday when the Bank of Itai France injected funds into the D Paris money market at 9.00 per Ir cent. The intervention rate was last changed on March 18, and Fre the other main instrument of - monetary policy, the five to 10- day repurchase rate, has been unchanged at 10 per cent since October 81, 1990. The Danish krone remained the second weakest ERM cur- rency, but has shown some improvement recently, thanks to good demand for Danish golelrment paper. This has followed the Dadish National Bank's decision to follow Ger- man interest rates higher last month, while having the low- est inflation rate in the Euro- pean Community at around 2.5 per cent. At the London close the dol- lar had fallen to DM1.7455 from DM1.7485; to FFr5.9300 from FFr5.9375; and to Y136.70 from Y136.85, but had improved to SFrl.5330 from SFrl.5280. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index eased to 66.6 from 66.7. Sterling finished unchanged against the firm D-Mark, but was generally strong after the ltest Mori opinion poll gave he UK Conservative govern- ment a two point lead over the Opposition Labour Party. The previous poll in July put Labour five points in front of the Tories and other recent polls have given Labour a lead of between two and nine points. The high profile of Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, n the Soviet crisis and in the Gulf War earlier this year, cou- pied with the latest opinion oll, provided some optimism that the ruling Conservative are capable of winning the next UK general election, which must be held by the middle of next year. Sterling rose 40 points to $i.6850 . It also improved to SFr2.5825 from SFr2.5675; to FFr9.9925 from FFr9.9800; and o Y230.25 from Y230.00, but was unchanged at DM2.9400. The pound's index gained 0.3 to 90.8.

   "text_content" : "By William Cochrame HE LAZY, hazy days of summer did happen this year; but they were overtaken last month by events, some of them earth- shaking, which may have left the financial world a better place. August started with another stock market scandal in Japan, whose malaise infected the whole of the Pacific Rim. A shaky Tokyo was hoping that gaiin - or foreigners - would come in to rescue the market from its depression, as they had six months before. Attention was diverted to Germany on August 15, when the Bundesbank's long-awaited increases in the discount and Lombard rates were repeated by other central banks in Europe. At about that time, the US moved temporarily down- hill on a home-grown bond markets scandal involving Salomon Bros. But all of these considerations were set aside on August 19, in the maelstrom of emotions raised by the Soviet coup and its aftermath. European market indices fell by up to 10 per cent on the day of the coup, while equity turn- over shot up. In Germany, it more than doubled to DM9.3bn FT-A World Index in local currency 128 126 124 122 120 118 116 11A August 1991 souo:D-aÂ«0 t \"m 100 98 96 94 92 90 88 FT-A World Indice in local urrencies rebsed FT-A World Index in local currency qIUw 4000 3900 3800 3700 3600 3500 ($5.3bn). In Tokyo, daily vol- ume expanded from 200m to 360m shares as the Nikkei Index dropped 6 per cent in its fifth worst daily loss; and in the US, down only 2 per cent, volume was still fairly heavy at 230m shares, against 188m the previous Friday. The coup failed, and markets around the world clawed back most of their losses. The US actually ended that week with a rise of 1.9 per cent, as the Dow hit another in this year's succession of all-time highs. On balance, Mr David Roche, the Morgan Stanley strategist, then felt better about global equity investment. Commu- nism, he said, was dead; the major obstacle to reform in the Soviet Union had been removed; and east European recovery would be facilitated by reduced political risk, and by the eventual recovery in the Soviet market once reform got under way. So last week may have marked a new beginning. It was a positive but muted one for global stock markets, as the FT-Actuaries World Index showed a 0.6 per cent rise in local currency terms, with Europe up 0.9 per cent, the Pacific Basin 0.8 per cent higher and North America just 0.3 per cent ahead. For Tokyo, the week opened with more scandal worries, this time centring on a hugely overborrowed mystic restaura- teuse. By the end of the week, however, the Asia Pacific region, and Japan within it, seemed to have made fairly positive moves, closing higher over five days while making significant declines on the month as a whole. But Mr Chris Sherwell, an analyst at Smith New Court, is not so sure. \"What drives Asia Pacific markets is growth in world trade,\" says Mr Sherwell. \"The picture at present is not encouraging, with the US snowing a stutterng recovery - not the big one everybody had been waiting for - and all of Europe affected by the tightening in German mone- tary policy. \"The Japanese economy is still falling off a cliff while it is awaiting, indeed expecting, a further cut in interest rates soon.\" Malaysia went along with last week's recovery but fell 9.2 per cent on the calendar month. While the country has finally undergone the tighten- ing of central bank monetary policy that investors have awaited for months, the mar- ket is still fundamentally weak and likely to stay that way, says Mr Sherwell. In Europe, Milan brought a securities market scandal to a third continent in succession. The market, depressed by the consequent delay of the August trading month settle- ment, ended 4.1 per cent lower on the month as a whole, com- pared with a 1.7 per cent rise for Europe. The continental star was France, up 2.3 per cent on the week and 5.7 per cent on the month. Nikko Securities, hav- ing observed a week earlier that the French government remained desperately anxious to cut interest rates in spite of the German move in mid- month, said last Friday that the market had been driven by rumour, rather than any fun- damental appraisal of corpo- rate worth. However, the French second- quarter gross domestic product growth rate of 0.8 per cent was far above expectations, and Nikko reaffirmed its positive stance on French equities. Across the Atlantic, Mexico went back to its earlier bullish ways after a quiet period. How- ever, not all analysts were con- vinced. \"The underlying mar- ket was a mixed bag, and the index was driven up by Tel- mex,\" says one. The post-privatisation stock apparently attracted foreign investment after Banamex, the most attractive of the compa- mies in the government's bank privatisation programme, was sold to a group of foreign investors.",

   "text_content" : "THE HOLIDAY in Wall Street kept trading quiet throughout the Continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was becalmed after its rise in moderately active trading last week, although the state bank sector attracted some demand. The CAC 40 index ended 0.74 lower at 1,863.52 after moving within a narrow range, as turnover shrank to about FFrl.l5bn from FFr2.7bn. Comments by Prime Minis- ter Edith Cresson at the week- end that partial privatisations were not taboo, provided that the proceeds were used to help the unemployed or increase industrial competitiveness, maintained interest in the government-controlled banks. BNP investment certificates, which jumped 6.5 per cent on Friday after comments by the finance minister that privatisa- tions could be on the way, rose Wall Street and Toronto were shut yesterday for Labor Day. FFr12 or 4.3 per cent to FFr291, with 57,875 units changing hands. Credit Lyonnais certifi- cates gained FFr22 or 4.5 per cent to FFr506. Among the day's losers, CMB Packaging fell FFr3.80 or 2.4 per cent to FFrl56.10, on profit-taking and amid specula- tion that its chairman might resign. FRANKFURT was remark- able for a DAX index which closed just 0.04 lower at 1,650.46, after a 1.68 rise to 687.94 in the FAZ at midses- sion. Dealers said that, where prices changed, moves were exaggerated by the thin vol- ume of trading. Volkswagen continued to move up on last week's interim report and the launch of its new Golf model, putting on DM4.40 to DM387.40, while other carmakers attracted less attention. Among the utility-based groups, Viag rose DM5 to DM404 as analysts continued to advance the merits of its quoted subsidiaries, such as the packaging company, Schmalbach-Lubeka; in the same sector, RWE ended DM2 PT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Sep 2 Hourly changes Open 10 am 11 am Noon 1pm 2 pm 3 pm Clos 1129.12 1128.74 1128.69 1128.08 1127.39 1126.90 1126.38 1126.81 Day's High 1129.12 Day's Low 1126.30 Aug 30 Aug 29 Aug 28 Aug 27 Aug 23 1125.84 1124.82 1121.03 1118.91 1112.34 ase value 1000 (28/10/0). lower at DM387.60. MILAN fell as uncertainty about the end of the August trading account, postponed from last Friday pending the liquidation of two stockbrokers involved in the market's latest trading scandal, kept investors away. The Comit index closed 2.48 lower at 552.96 in volume estimated at a meagre L50bn, after L70bn last Friday. Pirelli Spa and Pirelli & C bucked the trend, closing L22 better at L1,978, and L80 higher at.L6,680, respectively. Cement shares and papermakers saw profit-taking, Cementir falling L100 to L2,640 and Burgo, down L130 at L9,850 at the close, los- ing another L50 after hours. AMSTERDAM rose in quiet business. The CBS tendency index added 0.4 to 91.6, after staying within a tight trading range. Gist Brocades, the biotech- nology company, gained Fl 1 or 2.8 per cent to F137.10 before its first-half results, due today. Foreign demand, mostly from the UK, lifted Philips shares by 60 cents or 1.6 per cent to a year's high of F137. BRUSSELS saw more action in Colruyt, the retailer which was the subject of foreign buy- ing last week. It remained one of the most traded stocks, with just under 15,000 shares chang- ing hands. It closed up BFr7O at BFr3,850. The Bel20 index ended 3.34 higher at 1,132.26 as the blue-chip holding company, Socidtd Gdndrale de Belgique closed BFr6O, or 2.6 per cent, higher at BFr2,410. Traders said that fundamental invest- ment interest had appeared in Belgian quality shares. MADRID moved higher, but turnover was low at about Pta7bn, down from Ptal3.6bn. The general index added 1.63 to 274.80. Construction stocks were firm, with Dragados, which reported a 74 per cent rise in first-half net profits, Pta30 higher at Pta975, and Asland up Pta50 at Pta2,625. Telef6n- ica, which rose Ptal2 on Friday after a second-quarter profits recovery, fell Pta7 to Pta975 in light trading. ZURICH traders said that the US holiday kept interest to a minimum as the Crddit Suisse index fell 3.0 to 536.2. Schindler bearers lost SFr7O to SFr4,480 after the lift maker's disap- pointing interim statement last week. STOCKHOLM declined in fairly thin volumes as inves- tors held back before this month's general elections. The Affirsvirlden General index fell 7.1 to 1,090.4 in turnover of SKr275m, down from SKr496m. Skandia, the insurer, recov- ered most of Friday's losses, which had followed news of a sharp fall in its first-half oper- ating profit. The free B shares rose SKr4 to SKr179. HELSINKI also eased, with the Hex index down 7.5 at 968.2 in light turnover of FM23m. The market was waiting for news of pay talks between the government and unions. ISTANBUL fell for the third consecutive session, as the 75- share index lost 162.84 or 4.9 per cent to 3,138.45. Political worries before next month's general elections kept domestic investors away.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo EXPECTATIONS of an immi- nent cut in the official discount rate spurred short-covering activity yesterday, and share prices edged up on demand from foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose 133.14 to close at 22,469.01, after a day's low of 22,175.05 and high of 22,594.44. Volume rose to 320m shares from 300m, sup- ported by foreign activity. Advances led declines by 716 to 221, while 153 issues were unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed up 17.60 at 1,749.70 and, in Lon- don trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.08 to 1,345.45. Weak US economic indica- tors last week and the recent bankruptcy of an Osaka-based condominium developer encouraged hopes of an early reduction in discount rate. Overseas investors stepped up buying last week. Trading by foreigners is estimated to have decreased by 20.to 30 per cent in August from July, but net purchases were estimated to have increased to Y600bn from July's Y382bn. Mr Paul Muller at Schroder Securities said the big question was whether local institutions would follow suit. \"Domestic investors now seem cautiously optimistic due to the interest rate outlook,\" he added. Interest rate-sensitive issues moved higher, and large-capi- tal issues gained ground on heavy buying by foreigners. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, added Y15 at Y426 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries climbed Y22 to Y721. Meiji Seika, the confectioner, moved ahead Y41 to Y886. The issue has been popular recently on reports that the company has developed a can- cer-preventing antibiotic. Morinaga Milk Industry, the dairy producer, rose Y40 to Y2,190 on interest in its new drug Leukoprol. Arabian Oil, the oil refiner, lost Y20 to Y5,520 on small-lot selling after the company announced that pre-tax profits for the first half to June fell to one-sixth of the previous year's level, with net losses of Y800m. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 357.51 to 24,175.24 on vol- ume of 36.9m shares, up from 22m. Small-capital shares with good earnings estimates saw buying. Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, put on Y210 to Y2,310 on short-covering. Kurimoto, the iron pipe maker, improved Y10 to Y1,630. Investors were encouraged by the company's new technology which sorts construction refuse for recycling. Roundup OPTIMISM ABOUT interest rate cuts or economic pros- pects lifted Taiwan and Bang- kok, but most markets closed little changed. TAIWAN rose on hopes of a fall in short-term interest rates. The weighted index gained 130.15 or 2.9 per cent to 4,673.68 in turnover of T$28bn, up from Saturday's T$22bn. The central bank was said to be planning a meeting early this week to discuss cutting the rediscount rate, in response to demands from the business community. Banking shares, which make up a large proportion of the index and have fallen sharply recently, were the day's biggest risers. BANGKOK's rally continued in active trading, on growing optimism about next month's World Bank/International Mon- etary Fund meeting. The SET index gained 17.43 or 2.5 per cent to 723.08, its sixth consec- utive rise, on heavy turnover of 5.5bn baht, up from 4.3bn. HONG KONG finished slightly higher. The Hang Seng index closed 25.28 up at 4,023.54, after reaching an intraday high of about 4,032. Turnover slipped to HK$1.09bn from HK$1.38bn. Hongkong Land Holdings appreciated 10 cents to HK$8.95 on news that Hongkong Land Property, its wholly owned subsidiary, has agreed to sell three properties to Chinese Estates Holdings for HK$1.37bn. KUALA LUMPUR picked up on bargain hunting. Most of the demand came from domes- tic institutions and local indi- viduals, but foreign funds were also said to be moving back into the market. The composite index firmed 5.63 to 559.09. SINGAPORE ended little changed, as the effect of early profit-taking was cancelled out by selective buying. Investors were cautious after the week- end's general elections, which revealed a decline in support for the ruling party. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 3.23 to 1,429.01 and volume shrank to 29m shares from 67m. AUSTRALIA edged lower in light dealings. The All Ordi- naries index slipped 1.2 to 1,539.1 in turnover of A$98m, down from Friday's A$248m. Boral, the building group, announced a fall of 34 per cent in operating profits, in line with expectations. The stock rose 4 cents to A$3.23. NEW ZEALAND declined in thin trading. The NZSE-40 index fell 11.33 to 1,403.52 in turnover of NZ$9m, against a previous NZ$13.8m. Magnum, the brewing and retail company, dropped 15 cents to NZ$2 after announcing a worse than expected fall in net profits on Friday. Lion Nathan, another brewer, shed 9 cents to NZ$3.05. SEOUL fell on rumours that manufacturing companies were planning rights issues and that the government would announce measures to reduce the current account deficit. The composite index ended 7.99 lower at 675.12. Turnover was light at Wonl20bn, not far above Saturday's half-day ses- sion total of Wonll2bn.",

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor A G OWING shortage of stock in the leading blue chips helped drive share prices ahead in an optimistic London stock market yesterday. Wall Street's closure for Labor Day restrained business in the international leaders but the Footsie gained a further 33.9 to establish a new all-time peak. Investors took an increas- ingly favourable view of the political and economic outlook in the UK, and speculation that a takeover bid is pending for one of the UK's Seaq-listed companies provided a further spur to market confidence. The FT-SE closed at 2,679.6, with some of the more optimis- tic traders openly predicting a level of 2,900 by the year-end. However, some cooler heads pointed out that turnover was a modest 368m shares yester- Aoeoot Deain Dmte Aug 12 Sep 2 Sep 16 Aug 29 Sep 12 Sep 26 Led Dodi~g; Aug 30 Sep 13 Sep 27 Arcem Der. Sep 9 Sep 23 Oct -MlU - two buee dspe auN. day, compared with 397.7m on Friday, and that the absence of Wall Street had left London traders free to concentrate on purely domestic factors. Hopes for a more favourable turn in the UK economy were encouraged by a Financial Times study of economic fore casts which suggested that the ecession is likely to end this year. Similar optimism was expressed in a survey of busi ness opinion compiled by the Confederation of British Indus- try. On the political front, equi- ties responded favourably to the latest public opinion poll, which indicated that the gov erning Conservative party is now two points ahead of Labour, a trend expected to be helped by the visits to the US and China by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. The combination of these bullish factors inspired institu- tional buying yesterday. Most fund managers now appear tc be flush with cash again and hungry to buy equities, espe- cially those managers who failed to catch the market when it turned sharply after the coup in Soviet Russia proved abortive. On the other side of the counter, marketmakers are now very short of stock indeed across a wide range of blue chip stocks; perhaps in as much as 75 per cent of the Seaq list, according to one leading brokerage trader. Share prices opened higher in spite of Wall Street's unex- citing performance on Friday. London dealers expect the US market to make a more signifi- cant response to the sharp gain in US leading economic indica- tors when it returns to work after Labor Day. UK shares quickly moved ahead, with substantial gains recorded among the store and retail groups which would respond most quickly to a recovery in the domestic econ- omy. These sectors also reflected confidence in the interest rate environment, although the economists reported by the FT usgatted that base rates could not be cut below 10 per cent \"before the next election\". Renewed hints that Philip Morris, the US tobacco group, will soon make its move against a European company hifted yesterday from Cad- bury Schweppes to Allied- Lyons; Anheuser-Busch of the US was also suggested as a -ossible player in a bid strug- gle among London's Seaq-listed companies. Bid speculation and eco- nomic optimism proved suffi- cent to override the continued hints that further substantial rights issues could be in the ofling. British Aerospace, Blue Circle and Burmah-Castrol were all put forward as possi- ble fund-raising candidates in the equity market.",

   "text_content" : "BRITISH Aerospace retreated on increased speculation that * the company would launch a big rights issue. At one stage the shares were down 13, but they rallied to close a net 8 off at 547p on turnover of 1.2m. BAe was also hit by news that the government was to award a Â£1.5bn helicopter order to a consortium led by IBM, which includes Westland Group. British Aerospace, together with GEC, had fought hard to win the order. There was speculation in the market that BAe may use some of the proceeds from a rights issue to launch a bid for Westland, pos- sibly buying GKN's 22 per cent stake in Westland as a launch- pad for such a bid. Mr Paul Compton at UBS Phillips&Drew, said: \"If they have a rights issue at this price, it is a distress signal which will be bad for senti- ment.\" He added: \"I do not think they will buy Westland with expensive equity.\" BAe has interim figures due later this month. The range of forecasts is between Â£80m to Â£100m. Westland advanced 14 to 135p on news of the helicop- ter order, while GKN put on 6 to 385p on the same news. Racal rump Initial dealings on the Seaq trading system of shares in the rump of the Racal Electronics businesses excluding Racal Telecom began on a buoyant note yesterday. Shares in the \"rump\" busi- ness, including the defence, communications and the secu- rity side of the company, offi- cially opened on Seaq trading screens at 34p, a level gener- ally regarded as higher than expected, and climbed to 38p before ending the day at 37p. Dealers said activity in the \"rump\" was better than had been expected, with turnover of 12m shares recorded. The demerger of Racal Tele- com from Racal Electronics comes to fruition on September' 16. Official dealings in the \"rump\", designated Racal Spe- cial Ex, by the Stock Exchange, ran concurrent to a presentation in London given by Racal representatives to stock market analysts.Racal also announced a ElÂ£0m Middle East order for military radios. Racal Electronics shares also came in for good support, clos- ing 8 higher at 230p on 3.7m, while Racal Telecom, which initially slipped to 335p, closed only a fraction easier on bal- ance at 340p. Allied active Allied-Lyons provided the strongest feature among drinks companies as speculation that the company would soon be a bid target returned to the market. Philip Morris, of the US, was again the favourite to launch a bid, with a take-out price of Â£7.50 a share mentioned. Allied shares responded by adding 21 at 617p as turnover expanded to 3.2m. There was also, how- ever, a view that Japanese drinks giant Suntory could act as a white knight in the event of a hostile bid. One analyst, however, dis- counted a bid from Philip Mor- ris, saying the company is unlikely to want to make a bid of more than Â£5bn at the moment, and probably does not wish to expand the alcohol side of its business. US brewer Anheuser Busch was also rumoured as a possi- ble suitor, though only if a bid was agreed. Rolls-Royce moved up 2%/ to 139'/p on speculation that BMW, of Germany, which has a stake of around 2 per cent in the company, would soon launch a bid. News of an order pushed Vosper Thorneycroft 15 higher to 277p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (234) BRITISH FUNDS (42) Treas. 8pc 1991.

News of a resurgence of pop- ularity for the governing Con- servative party, evidenced by an opinion poll in the weekend press, triggered a wave of heavy buying for the utilities. Water, electricity and power generator stocks all performed exceptionally well, while Brit- ish Gas and British Telecom attracted above-average demand from institutions. Water issues were being chased hard late in the day, when the Seaq delayed ticker revealed a series of big trades involving the water companies. The stocks were badly mauled at various times earlier this year when polls suggested that the Conservatives were strug- gling. Late buying of the waters included lines of 1.3m North West Water, 1.6m Thames, 3.1m Anglian Water and 2.5m Severn Trent. Lines of 500,000 Welsh Water, 485,000 York- shire and 908,000 Southern Water showed up on the ticker. North West jumped 15 to 380p, Severn Trent and York- shire 13 each to 344p and 397p respectively, and South West 12 to 357p. Big rises in regional electric- ity shares were illustrated by a leap of 62 in the Electricity Package to Â£2095. The stores sector responded strongly to a more optimistic survey from the Confederation of British Industry, with many of the leading shares rising by more than 3 per centagainst a FT 130 125 120 115 Tun Exck1 InlraÂ· 600 400 200 200 indi est thei the adv sorn stro 10 a at5 T Libe hop rep< son, tor, on 1 erty if a will its. reti AmI( lato Phil and Bri< 514i con' mai Inte ahe resu recc tend inte wer attr BWn 622] COu: peri to < todi Seal is I prol Â£llr 130C 1250 1200 1150 Eq Turn Exuc FT.A All-Share Index Euity Shares Traded Turnover by volume (million) Excluding: Intra-maket bulnme & Ovreas turnover Eq Tun ExcC1 Int~aÂ· 600 400 200 2-00 indt est the~ the adv fern stro 10a at5 Libe hope repe son, tor, onl erty ifs will its~ retl AUI( late Phil and Brit 5141 con' mar Inte ahe resu recc terd inte wen attn BCn 6221 COP: perf to4 toda Seel isk NPII pro~ Erlm 2-poi: inde; est t ther thes adva form stror 10at at 5 Th Libel hope repol son, tor,' onti erty if a willi its Ji Ci retrt Atie latorr Philil and Britir 514p conti marl Ch Intel ahea resul recol terdi intel were attra Th BOC 622p Cour perfc to 4 todi Seenu is I MMT profl form 2-point rise by the FT-SE 100 index. Suggestions that inter- est rates may be cut by a fur- ther % point before the end of the month also triggered fresh advances. Some of the best per- formers included GUS \"A\", 50 stronger at 1450p, Boots, ahead 10 at 439p, and Kingfisher, up 7 at 581p. The voting \"A\" shares in Liberty advanced 35 to 630p as hopes of a bid rose after it was reported that Mr Brian Myer- son, the South African inves- tor, was behind the dawn raid on the shares last month. Lib- erty countered by saying that if a hostile bid is launched it will accept an offer from Seibu, its Japanese partner. Cadbury Schweppes retreated 6 to 412p as Allied-Lyons became the specu- lators' favourite for a bid from Philip Morris, the US tobacco and food group. Associated British Foods eased a penny to 514p as small lines of stock continued to overhang the market. Chemicals group Croda International gained 7 to 186p ahead of tomorrow's interim results. County NatWest was recommending the stock yes- terday, arguing that the interim and final dividends were secure and the yield was attractive. The sector was firm, with BOC being squeezed up 18 to 622p on thin volume and Courtaulds continuing its solid performance with a rise of 12 to 497p. MTM, which reports today, appreciated 14 to 265p. Securities house Hoare Govett is looking for acquisitions by MTM to have boosted interim profits by nearly Â£6m to Â£llm and earnings per share by 16 per cent to 9.9p. Betterware Consumer Prod- ucts put on 5 to 184p on the back of an announcement that it was beginning the first phase of its international expansion by commencing trading in France. Footwear and fabrics group Headlam picked up 4 to 62p after announcing that it was in discussions which could lead to the company making a sub- stantial acquisition. Lonrho failed to benefit from the market's gain after the company's broker, UBS Phillips&Drew, cut its profits forecast. The broker would not comment on the details of the downgrade but said it had been forced to revise its view because of the decline in pre- cious metals prices. The shares were flat at 239%/p. Press speculation over a pos- sible rights issue continued to rein back BET, which managed a gain of only a penny to 216p. Bermuda-based car auction group ADT moved ahead 20 to 508p after director Mr Michael Ashcroft increased his stake by buying in New York. Reckitt & Colman rose 15 to 715p ahead of interim results due on Thursday, as did Bowater (up 10 to 695p), which reports today.

   "text_content" : "STOCK index futures led the share market to another all-time high yesterday as investors used the derivatives market to increase their expo- sure to UK equities rather than go through the cash mar- ket, writes Jim McCallum. The September FT-SE 100 index contract set the pace for the stock market, rallying to a premium to the spot index of more than 30 points soon after opening, compared with a fair value premium of 9 points. But the strength of futures spurred only a few investors to try to profit from this discrep- ancy between the two markets by arbitrage deals. This was said to be due to lack of inter- est by larger investors and the quietness on the stock market, which meant there was insuffi- cient stock on offer. The September FT-SE closed at 2,703, up 29 points on the day and at a 23-point premium to the spot index. In the options market, activ- ity was dominated by dealing in call options, where there was modest buying against existing stock holdings. In the busiest stock options (Rolls-Royce, Forte, GEC, Scot- tish Power and Hillsdown), virtually all the business was in calls, with November and December strike prices gener- ally proving to be the most popular.",
