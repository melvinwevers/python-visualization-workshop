MONDAY Evening. Easy credit conditions were fully maintained in Lombard Street to-day, supplies of floating credit being more than ample to meet demands despite the heavy payments to be made for new Treasury bills. Overnight accom- modation against bills was freely available at 3 per cent. from the clearing banks but, as before, the week-end advances could be obtained in outside quarters at 24 per cent. down to 2' per cent. before the close. The undertone for discounts was again easier and although leading houses quoted 3 per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts the competitive rate was 3% per cent. The clearing banks were buyers of November maturities at 3% per cent. and early Decembers at 3% per cent., while there were even buyers of \"hot\" Treasury bills at 3%, per cent. The possibility of a reduction in Bank Rate was being more freely discussed. LOANS DISCOUNT PER CENT. PER CENT.

The volume of business was still described as modest. With only poor sup- port speculative selling of silver caused prices to drop %d to 20'%.d per ounce for both cash and forward delivery. Exchange Rates In contradistinction to Saturday there were only two alterations in official quota- tions, the French franc being called 175% middle, as compared with 176%. The spread, however, was widened to 1% francs. The Argentine peso was quoted 7%' points dearer at 16.92%. An interesting feature was the re- appearance of a quotation for Italian lire, this being 77%4 middle, as against the immediate pre-war figure of 81.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 11th Sept. A rush of buying orders for \"war\" stocks from all parts of the country was the chief feature of another very active session, during which fairly considerable profit-taking was readily absorbed. Much of the purchasing was believed to be based on expectations that the Neutrality Act will be amended. A further stimulus was the growing belief that there will be a long-drawn-out conflict in Europe from which virtually all groups of American industry will benefit. The final list re- corded general gains extending to $5. Prices opened irregular, but business soon became active, with the \" ticker \" fall- ing four minutes behind transactions. Turnover in the first hour was a million and a-quarter shares. Realising then set in, and at midday quotations were frac- tions to $1 higher, but Mining and Mer- chandisings were heavy. In the early afternoon prices rebounded, buying interest being focused on Steels, Aircrafts, Chemicals, Papers and Ship- pings. Motors, Coppers and Oils were also supported. The list fluctuated in the late dealings as realising, proceeded, but finished around the day's best levels in a strong close. Particular bright spots were Johns-Manville, American Can, Allied Chemical, United States Steel and Bethlehem Steel. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average soared 4.21 to the new 1939 high of 155.12, and Rails gained 0.79 to 31.30, but Utilities declined 0.19 to 23.49. Turn- over reached 4,680,000 shares, covering 981 individual stocks, of which 605 advanced, 260 receded and 116 were unchanged. Steels were again prominent on the spec- -J -I-.iL \" tacular rise of 11% points in this week's steel production rate to just over 70 per cent. of capacity, the highest for two years. In the Bond market U.S. Governments again sagged and Railroads were irregu- lar; bond sales totalled $34,440,000. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was 167.5, against 167.5 on Saturday. Railroad freight loadings for the week to 2nd September totalled 721,700 cars, an increase of 33,100 on the week and of 73,700 on the corresponding week of last year. The total is a new 1939 peak. Motor-car production last week is esti- mated by Ward's at 26,865 units, against 25,240 in the previous week. An important threat to motor-car output has bcen removed by the settlement of a strike at Bendix Aviation Corporation's plants. General Motors' sales of cars and lorries to domestic consumers in August amounted to 76,120 units, compared with 102.030 in July. Building contracts awarded for all classes of construction in the 37 Eastern States in August totalled $312,330,000, compared with $299,880,000 in July. Zinc production in U.S. in August amounted to 41,000 tons, compared with 39,700 in July, and deliveries to 49,900 tons, against 43,100. Stocks at the efid of August declined to 122,800 tons from 131,800 tons at the end of July. Iron and steel exports in July aggre- gated 513,660 tons, in contrast with 588.860 tons in June. Imports totalled 30,850 tons, against 32,590. The exchange of American cheques at the leading clearing houses in August amounted to $24,962 millions, compared with $23,849 millions in July.",

   "text_content" : "vVdIÂ·''Il I A U3 ji C11 IrljJu There was, again an inclination yesterday to nibble at equities, but the buying was of a very selective character and as a rule of moderate proportions. Would-be purchasers favoured chiefly Commodity shares-namely, Oils, Rubbers and Coppers. With new bargains restricted to a cash only basis it takes a certain time to find dealers having stock on their books or knowing where to get it. Conse- quently the early sellers yesterday of popular descriptions such as Shell, Roan Antelope and Rubber Trust sometimes secured .the best prices. By the time later offers came along the day's quota of demand had often been satisfied. In such cases there was naturally , a partial relapse in quotations. Settlement Arrangements By this afternoon members are ex- pected by the Committee to have com- pleted arrangements for closing or continuing the pre-war bargains, of which the Settlement is to be held on Thursday week, 21st September. Where bulls have been able to sell at the last making-up price, or higher, the general practice has been, I gather, to ask them either to do so or pay for the stock. There was, however, some complaint-justified or not-that certain .clients had been forced out yesterday at unreasonably low prices. It was also asserted that a few takers-in of Yankees would not give as good prices as could be got elsewhere and yet tried to insist on their particular bulls closing with them. Investment Polici A leading firm of brokers in the first wartime issue of itr. weekly market re- view suggests that the impending War Budget will follow normal lines and will result in increases in some of the pre- sent taxes, which include oil, petrol and industrial spirits, tea, wine, tobacco, beer, alcohol, patent medicines, motor- vehicles, playing cards, entertainments, silk and artificial silk, matches, sugar, chicory, cocoa and coffee. It may not be at present advisable to buy the shares of companies engaged in these vaYious in 2tries until the new- Budget is announced. Raleigh Cycle shares, however, are considered an attractive purchase, even though there is a possibility that bicycles may be taxed. Many City shops sold out of pedal cycles last week. Gas and By-Products Among retail stores, my broker friends suggest that the position of Boots should be considerably im- proved. Another sound Industrial in- vestment should be Smith and Nephew, which company provides so many neces- sities for the medical and surgical world. The growing list of Government regu- lations fixing prices of various com- modities and certain restrictions in the use of gas and electricity must be con- sidered, but gas companies are probably in a more favourable position than electric light producers, as their by- products will be in full demand. Gilt-edged stocks will be affected less by taxation than by the course of the conflict and by the method and terms upon which Government does its war financing. It is thought that Bank Rate will be brought down again to not above 3 per cent. before the new War Loans are launched. The moneyed public will meantime reserve its main energies for a patriotic and overwhelming response. Tbhe Miariat",

   "text_content" : "MONDAY Evening. The beginning of a fresh week under the new Stock Exchange con- ditions brought no improvement in turnover. Business was again im- peded by the need of adjustment of an open account to cash dealings, and prices in some of the main sections had an easier tendency. Chief among the price influences was the probability of a considerable increase in taxation in the Supple- mentary Budget. This factor was responsible for a general weakening of investment stocks. The day's good features included Textile, Shipping and some American shares. Commodity factors kept inte- rest alive in Argentine Railways and Rhodesian Coppers. Minimum prices in the gilt-edged market provided a less satisfactory basis for dealings. Turnover contracted and sales at the minima became more difficult. Consols 2% per cent. were marked down % to the fixed price of 62 and all other British Government issues remained at minimum levels. Very little business was recorded in Home Corporation stocks. Dominion and Colonial 'ssues changed hands more fre- quently, but generally at or near their minima. Gilt-edged Prices Page 4 CHILEANS RISE FURTHER Activity in the Foreign market was again restricted, and was concentrated largely on relatively few issues. Purchases of Chilean issues against sales of the same issues in New York were responsible for further improvement in London quota- tions. The 4% per cent. rose 3 to 12Y and the 7% per cent. 2% to 13%. Among Europeans, German 5 per cents. were marked down 2% to 10-. Bear closing of Germans is now said to be giving less support to the market. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 Few purchasers of Home Rail Prior Charges were forthcoming at the mini- mum prices which still obtain in the market. Accordingly, disposal by would- be sellers was not easy and little stock changed hands. The special importance of the Argentine in war-time as a food-producing country continues to attract the investor's atten- tion. B.A.G.S. 5 per cent. Preference led a further rise yesterday with a gain of 3 points to 23, while the Ordinary advanced 2% to 9. Elsewhere, Central Argentine 6 per cent. Preference added 2, to close a*t..21% anud .Antofagasta. advanced from. 5% to 6%. Canadian Pacific again followed the Wall Street quotation and improved by % to 6%. Indian Railways turned firm New York Central wer- the only stock in evidence in the Amenican group and buyers paid up to 1% more than the Friday evening closing price. Final middle quotation was 20. Pennsylvania changed hands between extremes of 23 and 24%, but the final quotation was % lower at 22%. Home and Overseas Rail prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS QUIETER Taxation and Other Fears Exercise Restraint In contrast to the cheerfulness displayed last week, Industrial shares generally were dull and prices in the leading groups be- came reactionary. Actual demand was small and the new business offering was on a narrow basis. This permitted full play to the several adverse influences which had arisen. Among these, the fear of an addition to the income-tax affected many shares of investment standing. Hints of a possible increase in the duties on beer and tobacco caused a reactionary tendency among the shares concerned. The market in Tobacco shares also was disturbed by the dearer cost of leaf owing to the movement in the sterling-dollar exchange. The high- lights were provided again by Shipping shares and by an expanding demand for Textiles. Many brokers were preoccupied with the closing of old contango accounts. Apprehensions concerning the income- tax were reflected in the adverse trend of BANKING shares, which sympathised with the gilt-edged market. The turnover was small and recessions were light, no selling pressure being encountered. Losses were mainly in the Home group. INSURANCE shares were irregular with small changes. Little demand was in evidence for ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT shares. In a few instances sellers were encountered and prices slipped back. English Electrics left off Is 6d lower at 31s 6d, while General Electrics and Siemens lost 9d apiece. Signs of weakness were apparent among ELECTRIC SUPPLY securities. While little was going on among MOTOR shares the undertone was weak, but losses were confined to a few shares. Leylands gave way 5s to 85s and falls of Is 3d each were shown by Tillings, Morris and Austin Ordinary. No outstanding movements occurred in AIRCRAFTS. De Havillands yielded 7%d to 35s, Faireys 6d to 17s 3d and Hawker Siddeleys 3d to 13s. Princi- pal change in Components was a fall of 5s to 28s 9d in Triplex Glass on quite moderate selling. SHIPPING GROUP LIVELY Inquiry for SHIPPING shares was resumed and fair activity was witnessed. Towards the close a few shares tailed off from the top. Cunards were finally 4s 9d, after changing at 5s 9d. Court Lines were in request, changing up to 15s 6d, while business was done in King Lines up to 23s 6d, Furness Withys to 24s 6d and Union-Castles 12s. Clan Lines and P. and 0. were supported. Milford Docks changed at 15s 1%d. Public interest in STEEL and ARMAMENT shares was restricted to a few issues. Cammell Lairds, on small buying, rose 3d tn 7a 1 VA. Jnhn Browns. B.S.A. and Vickers were unchanged. Buyers paid up to 31s 6d for Imperial Chemicals and 22s 6d for Borax Deferred. Imperial Chemical Preference were good at 28s 3d. British Oxygens reacted 'I.. United Molasses displayed strength and changed Is 3d higher at 26s 6d, but left off at 25s 9d with a net gain of 9d. Weak- ness anew was indicated in the fresh fall of 9d'to 7s 9d in Electric and Musical. Better trade advices regarding the TEXTILE industry encouraged good inquiry for shares, but the bulk of the business was in. low-priced shares. Bradford Dyers Preference gained is to 6s 6d and the Ordinary 7%d to 4s 7%d. Rises of 6d each occurred in Calico Printers and in u v I rx t r-n.. - - I Fine Spinners. J. and P. Coats were 9d higher at 28s 9d. In RAYONS, Courtaulds and British Celanese were dullish. Listers were marked up 9d to 4s 6d. MULTIPLE STORE issues were sold and Woolworths changed down to 53s 9d, closing at 55s with a net loss of 5s. Marks and Spencer \"A\" receded 5s to 48s 9d and Gt. Universals were 4s lower at 25s. O.K. Bazaars were Is off at 20s. TOBACCOS LOWER In relation to market values BREWERY shares, while lower, were not seriously depressed beyond falls of 5s each in Ind Coope to 82s 6d and Mitchells and Butlers to 68s 9d. Other declines were relatively smaller. TOBAccos were lower on gloomy talk of fresh burdens on the trade. Imperials were % lower at 5% and British American % lower at 4%.. Carreras \"A\" and Gallahers lost %/ apiece. Feature among dollar shares, in which a fair business was done, was a jump of 6% to 81 in U.S. Steels and a reaction of 7% to 53 in International Nickels. Bethle- hems were 102, General Motors 63 and Chryslers 102. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 SOME OILS IN DEMAND A moderate turnover of Oil shares left prices with a further general improve- ment. It was still necessary to negotiate in order to deal and the difficulty of put- ting through business occasionally caused prices to move to an extent hardly justified by the size of the bargains. Shells enjoyed fair activity, some of it attributed to buying of an investment character, and at one time they were quoted as high as 4%/i. Reaction occurred before the close and the shares finished unaltered at 4',;. Royal Dutch changed hands once or twice only and were easier at 38%. Anglo-Iranians were %2 to the good at 3%, after business up to 71s 4%d, and Anglo-Egyptian \" B \" ,% higher at 3%.. Mexican Eagles were a weak feature, losing 6d to 4s 6d, but Canadians strengthened 3d to 7s 3d. One or two of the Trinidad group showed to advantage, Leaseholds rising %. to 4% and Apex 6d to 24s. Oil Prices Page 4 RUBBERS UP-TEAS EASY The market in Rubber shares was strong. With a jump in the commodity from 9yd to 10'/d per pound buying orders came in from many centres, and more business was put through. Stock continued in small supply, and advances in quotations were fairly general. Anglo-Dutch provided a good feature. As a result of professional buying the plice rioved up 2s ltd to 27s 6d. - - -. Rubber Trust, also in request at 28s 9d, added Is 3d, while United Sua Betong put on Is 9d at 50s. United Patani rose 9d to 17s 6d and Telogoredjo finished Is dearer at 16s 3d. Batu Caves were bought as a promising lock-up among the much-under- par issues, and put on 9d at 15s. Conditions in Mincing Lane shares were the same as those ruling on the Stock Exchange. The publication of Mincing Lane official lists will be resumed as from to-morrow (Tuesday). The raw rubber market opened at 10d nominal in comparison with 9%d on Friday last. During the day rates further improved. Following are the closing rates with those ruling on Friday in parentheses: Spot, September and October 10 d (9%d). October-December 10%d (9,d), January-March 10%d (9%d), April-June 10%d (9Y.d). Tea shares were on the easy side. There were a few sellers about. Business was better, though still small. Deamoolie changed hands at 44s 9d, Kohabur 14s 6d, Ceylon Tea Plantations 30s and Empire of India 21s. Demand for Tea-cum-Rubber issues was in evidence on the strength of raw rubber. Rubber and Tea Prices Page 4 BASE-METAL ISSUES GOOD Rhodesian Coppers Up-Gold Shares Depressed Among Mines, buyers chiefly confined their attention to Base-metal issues, notably Rhodesian Coppers, in which there was a good turnover, and the Australian Broken Hills. Uncertainty continued to surround the Gold share sections. Forced selling caused by the closing of contango positions thus took its toll of quotations. This was especially so in the non- producers, and others in the more specula- tive category. Buyers were difficult to find for these issues even at sharply reduced levels. On the other hand, it was generally possible to sell the dividend-payers on a negotiable basis. In Kaffirs, the reopening of the Johannesburg market made little material difference owing to the technical difficulties of dealing\" with that centre, among which the question of rapid and concise communication loomed large. How- ever, the Cape was reported to have taken small quantities of some of the dividend- payers. Paris remained cut off as far as current dealings were concerned. Among Kaffirs, West Wits. were called % lower at 3%, Blyvoor Is down at 5s 6d, Libanon %. off at % and Western Reefs Y to the bad at %. Venterspost were relatively well maintained at 1'%, on the imminent start of production. Marievale lost Is 6d to 14s 6d and Palms Is to 4s. RHODESIANS RISE West Africans were mostly lower where changed on small sales attributed to the closing of contango positions. Gold Coast Selection dropped is to 18s, after 17s 6d. Exceptionally Bibiani recovered 6d to 26s 6d. Rhodesian Gold shares were reported to be difficult to deal in, although prices were nominally unchanged. This followed the news that the Rhodesian Government is to adopt the Union precedent and take the gold proceeds of the mines above 160s I er ounce. Among Inulans, ,nampion Reef and Mysore each hardened ,.. Rhodesian Coppers finished slightly under the best. Johannesburg was re- ported to have sold some shares on the rise.

Consol Two and a-Half per Cents were readily taken, but War Loan and Conversion Three and a-Half per Cents. were not too easy to sell at the minimum figures. Shipping shares continued their rise. Brewery stocks gave way on apprehension of additional taxation. The Rubber market hardened. There was a little doing, too, in Americans. From among the Army uniforms in the House, a sailor stood out with conspicuous prominence. The Committee's Self-sacrifice The House closed at 2 o'clock. Five minutes earlier the Stock Exchange waiters rang their bells summoning a Committee meeting at 2 o'clock. Non-members of the Committee were agreed that they had the best of the bargain by which the Committee closed the House and, self-sacri- ficingly, called a meeting of themselves at the same hour. Kaffirs and Contangoes The fact of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange being reopened yesterday seemed to make little difference to Kaffir shares. Difficulty in most cases arose in connection with ship- ping the stock. Insurance rates have been multi- plied to such an extent that, although a few nominal prices came from the Cape, the actual volume of business which resulted was trivial. A certain amount of cash selling by people un- able to give on their stock, gave Kaffirs a dull and dispirited appearance. Copper and Tin Shares in the Rhodesian Copper market have turned good. Roans touched 20s before going back to 19s 6d. There was a moderate degree of activity in yesterday's market. Shares were changing hands in toler- ably large lines. The smaller man did not appear to be dealing to any extent. People are also trying to buy Tin shares. In fact, the Base-metal group became more animate than that for Gold shares; and, from the look of the market; the present pricesfor-Copper, Tin, Lead and Zinc shares hold chances of further improvement. Why Tobacco Shares Weakened Tobacco shares weakened for three reasons. The first, probable rise in the price of the leaf, need not trouble anybody; the second, likely increase in taxation, is inevitable; the third, additional cost of air-raid insurance. The last' looks too heavy, at the present announced rates, for it to be continued without doing undesirable damage to the trade at large. Carry-over Concessions The Stock Exchange Committee per- mit contangoes to go on, provided that they are done with the same people as at the previous Account. That is to say, if a man wants to give on or to take in shares he can do so with the man they are open with. If this is impracticable, he is forbidden to try elsewhere. The open Account is very small. Clearing sheets in connection with the 21st September Settlement must be sent in to-morrow. AutOlgua",

   "text_content" : "V V XC,, -aL J-..JL.J.LJ To devise a war-time investmenl policy will not be an easy matter. The speed with which Government control or supervision of industry is being made effective is one of many im- portant factors which must qualify acceptance of the experience of 1914-18 as a guide to investment con- duct at the present time. The rapid transition from peace economy to wai economy provides the assurance that the war will be efficiently prosecuted, But it leaves little time for the in- vestor to appreciate the significance of the changes which every day are occurring in the structure, distribu- tion and costs of industry. In the past week, to mention only a few develop- ments, the control of the railways, shipbuilding and coal supplies has been taken over by the Ministry of Transport, the Board of Trade and the Mines Department respectively, a start has been made upon the control of all exports and imports, and the Ministry of Supply has taken over the control of many raw material supplies. The industry most immediately and radically affected by this last men- tioned development is iron and steel, and at the week-end the Ministry's license and other requirements were explained at length. Maximum prices have been established, and at the same time it will be necessary to obtain licenses for the acquisition of all iron and steel goods and certain raw materials. Throughout the industry an elaborate system of priorities is being worked out. This orderly revo- lution is likely to have many parallels elsewhere. The price factor is evidently to be kept as rigid as possible, and it will need the maximum of investment acumen to foresee the effect upon costs of the other changes which are occurring. Already air raid precautions must have constituted a heavy burden upon many concerns, not only because of the need for physical protection but also through the administrative decentralisation which has been thought advisable in a number of cases. The Government, it has been an- nounced, is making its economic and military dispositions upon the assump- tion that the war will have a duration of at least three years. In that time it is possible that the social and economic changes the seeds of which have been sown in the past ten days will have grown permanent roots. The war of 1914 was responsible for the introduction of a great measure of Government control of industry, the effects of which never entirely dis- appeared, and that of 1939 is likely tc make a further addition to the Govern- ment's permanent place in the direc- tion of our economic life. Moreover, the geographical distribution of in- dustry can hardly remain unaffected, Quite apart from the purely financial problems of the present time, it is hardly surprising, in view of the radi- cal economic changes which are in prospect, that the Stock Exchange is making the establishment of a new scale of share values a gradual process.",

They have since been lower, but yesterday im- proved to 5s in sympathy with the Textile share group generally. The full accounts show that the net loss of Â£149,800 for the year ended 30th June was computed after charging the rather smaller amount of Â£356,800 for maintenance, depreciation, etc., and the usual Â£128,000 for debenture interest. This compares with a deficit of Â£93,500 for the previous year, when Â£367,200 was provided for mainten- ance and depreciation. These results indicate how difficult the export trade, on which the com- pany so largely depends, had become. There is little similar indication in the balance-sheet, however, apart from a reduction of nearly Â£100,000 in stocks. The year's loss is extinguished by drawing Â£150,000 from general re- serve, but at Â£1,550,000 the total re- serves are still at an impressive figure and are fully represented by Govern- ment and other marketable invest- ments of over Â£1,700,000. These are a good stand-by pending a return to profit-earning, although the near pros- pects of a payment of Preference dividend, which is in arrear since 1935, do not seem bright.",

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL Only two important adjustments were made in official exchange rates yesterday. These were in the French franc and the Argentine peso. Both were slightly dearer in terms of ster- ling. The spread between buying and selling rates for the French franc was expanded to 1Ã½ francs, as compared with a franc hitherto. The small appreciation in this cur- rency was due, presumably, to the news that the French Government had decided to introduce a system of ex- change control in defence of the gold reserves. By the decrees now intro- duced, export of French or foreign currency and the acquisition of pro- perty or securities abroad are pro- hibited. City circles were inclined to link the appointment of Monsieur Rueff to the Bank of France with the official exchange office to be controlled by the Central Bank. Gold Holdings News from Paris indicated that all trade in gold is forbidden. Thus far nothing seems to have been mentioned about the bullion holdings of French nationals abroad. According to bank- ing circles in London, the amount of metal held here, for example, on French account must be considerable. Speculation is rife as to how long it may be before there is an attempt to secure declarations of this gold. Complications Meantime, in addition to the foreign exchange departments of the banks, bullion dealers and the discount mar- ket are finding the new regulations working anything but smoothly. Even the routine business of the clearing has become complicated. In numerous instances there is delay which, in addition to causing irritation, is leading to considerable dislocation. As already stated in these notes official decisions are sometimes changed. There is already talk of the pos- sibility that some of the forms will need to be altered.",

Trading profit, as already shown, is Â£23,800 less at Â£54,700, or a drop of 30 per cent. Larger provision for bad debts is offset by savings in other directions and the net profit is Â£22,700 lower at Â£37,200. The dividend is reduced to 8 per cent., against 124 per cent., and is the lowest since 71 per cent. was paid in 1933. Reserve appro- priations are limited to Â£2,700 to in- vestments reserve against Â£10,000 to general reserve a year ago. The carry- forward is then much the same at Â£16,100. Apart from the increase in stocks from Â£131,000 to Â£137,600 the balance- sheet gives little evidence of reduced turnover. Debtors are Â£20,800 higher at Â£211,400. The holdings of cash and Government securities are down from Â£152,800 to Â£97,200, but the change is partly set off by an increase of Â£9,600 to Â£156,700 in outside investments other than trade interests.

Fol- lowing a decade of no Ordinary divi- dends, payments were made in the three years to 1938, but the junior capital has again dropped out of the dividend list, profits for the twelve months ended 30th June having de- clined sharply. This is the result of a sharply reduced demand and lower prices. Controlled by Newton Cham- bers and Co., the undertaking owns coke ovens and by-products plant which produced profits of only Â£33,400, including investment income, as cow- pared with Â£119,400 for the previous year. After income-tax and fees, the net profit comes to Â£18,800 in contrast with Â£76,200. The Preference dividend is short-earned by Â£4,000, but is paid by drawing on the carry-forward to that extent. Last year 75 per cent., equal to Â£21,600, was distributed on the Ordinary capital. Heavy reduction in debtors and creditors reflects the smaller business, while stocks have been accumulating. The financial position, however, is satisfactory, floating assets of Â£227,300 being more than four times the amount of current liabilities.",

P. F., Hove-1 Rep~rt is overdue and no information is obtainable. You should write direct to company. Information as contracts comes within the Official Secrets Acts and cannot be disclosed. 2. Taking the long view, Carreras is worth retaining. Crest-Unless you have some alternative investments in view for the proceeds of these shares we do not think that you should be over-hasty in selling. At pre- sent you may have to take poor prices, With fixed-interest shares of sound cin- panics you do know how you stand as regards income, but with variable dividend shares no payments are not improbable in many instances so that resources may be conserved. Better hold until markets are more normal. E. H. S.-I. Payment is to be made within three months of formation of new corpora- tion. It has not been formed yet. 2. B.C. Power and Quebec Power must be regis- tered. 1. H. L.-ln view of the upward trend in New York you should retain these stocks for the present. You must register them at the Bank of England. Hollyhock-These Aircraft shares have been depressed by sales on a market lacking ready buyers. They are unlikely to recover much until they return to favour. Reten. tion is advisable. J. L. W.-Regret that we have had to drop regular returns for present, but Friday's indices are now published on Mondays. Kersal-1. Would be inclined to keep Rand- fontein G'old. 2. France Fenwicks, Court Lines and King Lines are a promising selection. Lend-We have no information other than the Treasury Order published in our issue of 28th August. Apparently the Treasury is following the procedure of 1915 when dollar stocks were acquired by or loaned to the Government to acquire funds in the United States to pay for war material. We cannot say how the authorities would regard your liabilities in the U.S., but for the present you will have to conform to the order to register your stocks. Pilgrim-1. Treasury Order does not apply to any security if the person interested therein (other than as a beneficiary under a trust) is non-resident in the U.K. and has been out of the country since 26th August. 2. Non-resident owners need not register. S. B., Liverpool-We do not know of any such lists and suggest that you communi- cate with the London office of the \" Wall Street Journal,\" 28. Budge-row, E.C.4. Scot-1. Until the financial terms under which Government control has been assumed, it would be premature to advise purchase of that Railway stock. 2. This is a finance concern and under present condi- tions it is difficult to visualise company making good profits. 3. Neither offers special attraction, but for the long shot Carreras are to be preferred. Vectis--l. The only funds possessed by these concerns are those provided by the premiums received, less expenses, and whether they will prove adequate will depend upon the claims upon them. 2. We cannot forecast which of the two will come off best, but as the premium is low you would not be risking much by insuring your effects.",

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange yesterday began its first complete week of trading under war conditions. Fears of increased taxation in the Supplementary Budget produced a dull tone. Business was as difficult as ever and the fixed minimum prices for gilt-edged stocks provided a less effec- tive basis for dealing. The best features were provided by Textile, Shipping and Rhodesian Copper shares. Attendance was good, but the adaptation of operations to war conditions tended to make members cautious until further experience has been gained. The confinement of transactions to a cash basis was also a restrictive influence. Activity is considered likely to be restricted until the clearing up of the 7th September Account which has been postponed until 21st September. Members and staffs generally welcomed the new closing hour of 2 p.m. Many are engaged on A.R.P. and other volunteer ser- vices and the earlier closing enables them to devote more time to these activities. As indicated above Rhodesian Copper shares were one of the most active sections. After an early spurt there was some selling, partly from the Cape, and closing prices were below the best in some instances. Rhokanas rose 4 to 132, Roans Is 3d to 19s 6d, after 19s 9d, and Rhodesian Anglo Americans 3d to 25s 9d, after touching 26s 3d. TEXTILES AND SHIPPINGS Lower-priced Shares Wanted Textile and Shipping shares were features. In the former group, while Coats rose 9d to 28s 9d and English Sewing Cottons 3d to 26s 3d, the chief demand was for the lower-priced issues and for the shares of ancillary industries. The demand for Shipping shares in evidence towards the close of last week was resumed. Cunards closed 3d up at 4s 9d, after being up to 5s 9d. Furness Withy rose Is 3d to 24s. The Committee yesterday repeated last Friday's notice that notwithstanding the postponement of the 7th September Settle- ment members should make every en- deavour to settle outstanding bargains as soon as possible. In the event of members wishing to arrange the further continuation of exist- ing contangoes they are asked to do so by to-day in order that clearing lists may be sent into the department by 2.30 p.m. tn-mnrrnw.",

   "text_content" : "Movements in Oil shares since the be- ginning of war indicate that investors are taking a moderately optimistic view of the outlook for the petroleum industry in war conditions. This view is based on the assumption that war-time oil demands will greatly exceed normal peace requirements. Pre-war estimates placed the United Kingdom's oil needs in war time at twice or three times the country's normal re- quirements. How near this estimate is likely to approximate actual experience it is not yet possible to guess. All that the average investor has seen so far is a considerable diminution of road traffic which threatens to shrink still further when petrol is rationed at the end of this week. He knows, however, that there is a strong equalising factor in the greatly increased demand for oil for the Air Force, the Navy and for the movement of mechanised troops. The war is too young for the degree of balance between these contrary factors to be gauged. Uncertainty of mind has been created in some quarters by the announcement that the new \" Pool\" petrol, the only grade soon to be available, will be retailed at Is 6d per gallon. To the private motorist, accustomed to paying Is 7d per gallon for No. 1 spirit, it appears that the oil trade in this country will thereby be receiving less for its petrol. This is a false assumption. The greater part of the petrol normally sold in the United Kingdom is commercial spirit, re- tailing at Is 5d per gallon. The public as a whole has therefore been paying an aver- age of less than the Is 6d per gallon now to be charred for \" Pool \" snirit.",

   "text_content" : "1 I 1 A iÂ· t e t e t e e r e 1 J e s t t e e t n e By C. B. ORMEROD The present position of the London mar- ket from a Dow Theory angle is that the bear market which started at the end of 1it6 apparently discounted the tension and uncertainty of the past two years. Whether or not the actual outbreak of war was also discounted at the low levels reached last August remains to be seen. Judging from the general action of the market over the past month or so, it probably was. The course of prices over the next few weeks will soon provide the answer. If THE FINANCIAL TIMES Rail and Industrial indices can hold above their bear market lows of 35.2 and 91.2 and gradually work upwards, the gradual development of a new and selective bull market of an infla- tionary nature will be indicated. Readers of these Dow Theory articles will not have been surprised at Wall Street's reaction to the outbreak of war. By rising above their July peaks to the accompaniment of a huge volume of trading, the Dow-Jones averages have re- confirmed the existence of a primary bull market in the strongest possible fashion. Considerably higher prices for Ameri- can Common stocks (with the possible exception of Utilities) are likely. Ameri- can business is facing prospects of immense war-time purchases by Britain and France. A war boom has started. After a 20-point rise in only a few days a temporary reaction before long is to be expected. Such a reaction, if accompanied by a lower volume of trading, would pro- vide an excellent opportunity for those not already in the market to purchase stocks likely to benefit from present conditions. WALL STREET STRONG From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 11th Sept. A rush of buying of so-called war stocks lifted prices 1 to 5 points and more. Easily absorbing considerable profit-taking in its stride, the market forged ahead and closed strong. Turnover totalled 4,680,000 shares. Industrials, particularly Steels, were in chief demand. Rails also ad- vanced, but Utilities gave way. Widespread speculation by the public was induced by an expected call to Con- gress before the end of the week to meet for a special session, probably on 2nd Octo- ber. to amend the Neutrality Act. Trade news was bright, steel output jumping 11! points to 70 per cent. of capacity, the highest for two years. Sterling closed %c lower at $4.04%. Silver was %c down at 36'c per ounce.

   "text_content" : "Ã½J./J .L.Jl JVI \"I1.JJV L JILJ..J-1 Fears were expressed in the market yesterday as to the effect of the war upon the fortunes of store companies. Uncertainty had been reflected in prices before the outbreak of hos- tilities. Chain stores were an exception but it is now doubted whether increased trade will make good higher costs and greater taxation. So far as the leading West End stores and multiple shop companies are con- cerned, THE FINANCIAL TIMES was in- formed yesterday that no drastic steps to curtail activities were as yet in contem- plation. Present intention was to carry on trade ak near as possible on a normal basis. Departments are not being closed, although in many of the large stores it was admitted that trade apart from food and A.R.P. requisites was at a low ebb. Rumours that certain stores were closing down large sections of their build- ings seem to have arisen from the fact that in some instances allied departments are being nierged, as a measure of economy. Retail food stores hope to Imaintain their full services. With their branches throughout the country their trading in an essential commodity is well spread. Anothet market factor has been the possible effect of the high premium on the compulsory insurance of stocks It was pointed out by one authority that the 6f per cent. premium has to be related to turn- over. Where stocks are turned over more than half a dozen times in a year the actual premium works out at less than 1 per cent., so that in practice the impost would not be so onerous as would appear superficially",

   "text_content" : "Great Britain's trade agreements are o go on, so far as wartime conditions permit. It is understood that the Government has reached a decision to this effect; consequently there will be no move, such is had been feared in some quarters, o denounce existing pacts. No attempt is being made to disguise he difficulties which will arise from the rigid control over this cot \"itry's import and export trade. But the official view ippears to be that there is nothing to be gained by attempting to remedy complications before they have been lisclosed. Questions will be dealt with only as and when they arise. It may generally be assumed that within he next few weeks some of the friendly countries with which the United Kingdom has outstanding agreements will wish to liscuss the effects of wartime trade con- rol on commercial relations. IMPORTS BANNED Numerous complications may be cx- pected In relation to the Anglo-American rade agreement, for instance, the ban im- posed last week on the importation of ypewriters into this country would seem o contravene Article 15. This provides hat. except in certain circumstances-war s not specifically mentioned-no prohibi- ion or any form of quantitative regulation :hall be imposed on American products. Other anomalies may occur as the British Government, forced to limit ex- penditure on luxury products in order to conserve its resources for defence naterials, is obliged to discriminate be- ween different categories of imports. The prohibition of a wide range of British exports seems to contravene the letter of he treaty from another direction. The recent ban on the export of non-ferrous netals and other commodities normally re-e-:ported to the U.S. provides an example of what may be expected. On the other hand. the British Govern- nent has declared that the needs of British exporters will be considered as far as )ossible. And it is clear that the American narket, despite the operation of the Neutrality Act, provides a deep reservoir of goods which may be freely tapped. 'here is thus no reason to suppose that Anglo-American trade is to he allowed to shrivel. It seems that the treaty still has a function to perform in easing the flow of exchanges. With understanding co- operation on both sides it may well be ldapted to the new conditions. COAL FOR SCANDINAVIA The same can be said of other trade pacts, though, as their detailed nature differs so widely, there can be no generali- sation. The agreements with Scandinavian countries provide generally for an ex- change of foodstuffs and raw materials against British coal. Although the coal export surplus may be restricted, our de- nands for imported raw materials should be maintained. The balance of trade should thus swing more in favour of the Scandinavian countries, which-so long as he U.K. can pay for the goods-would hardly be a valid reason for denouncing in advantageous' tehty. \" As to the various export credit agree nents with countries such as Turkey, Rumania and Greece, it may be presumed hat an endeavour will be made to deliver he goods so far as this can he done with out impairing the country's defence 'equirements.",

Outside money was still obtainable at down to 2.' per cent., which meant that the market financed its bonds on cheaper terms than its bills. Discount rates were again adjusted and the rate for three months bank drafts was no better than 3%' per cent. What was described as a pointer towards a lower Bank Rate was the development of a demand for \" hot\" Treasury bills down to 3%, per cent. Presumably on the news of the intro- duction of exchange control in France, the French franc was moved against sterling to a modest extent yesterday, the Paris- London rate being 175% against 176% middle. The spread between buying and selling rates, however, was widened to Frs.1 .. An interesting feature was the appear- ance of a quotation for Italian lira for the first time since the outbreak of war, the rate being 77%. as against 81 on 2nd September.

   "text_content" : "The marine insurance companies put into operation yesterday the grouping scheme which had been pre- pared in advance as a war-time emergency measure. Two important groups have been formed, in one or the other of which practically every marine insurance company in the market has been en- rolled. Each group operates from one underwriting room in Lloyd's Build- ing, one from the room of the Indemnity Marine Insurance Company and the other from that of the Sun Insurance Office. SAVING TIME AND LABOUR In this way a broker with a risk to offer in the company market need only visit two underwriting rouoms and a mutual under- standing has been reached so that not only the two, cmpnany groups but Lloyd's underwriters receive a fair share of the business on offer. The amount of time and labour saved will be very great. In addition, where previously each com- pany issued an individual policy in respect of each risk it accepted, one policy will be issued by each group on behalf of all its members. The Institute of London Underwriters has issued additional rates to attach to the general war risk schedule of rates apply- ing to all business outside the scope of the Government War Risk Insurance scheme. The rates are 10 per cent. for voyages within the area Siam, India. Netherlands Indies, Malaya, Burma and British Borneo and including voyages between the Straits and Indo-China not north of Saigon, and 50 per cent, to Istanbul from Black Sea non-Turkish ports",

Dealers want an early clarification of the position. Compulsory war risk insurance, in particular, has caused irksome problems and supports the view that maximum prices should be higher than those proposed. Complaints are heard in the market of dealers wha, having contracted before the war to deliver copper, urge that the heavy burden of war ri-sk insurance should be passed on to the purchaser. It is freely asserted that the Â£51 maximum proposed for electro wire bars is insufficient, especi- ally as the-current quotation in Belgium is Â£73 a ton. Pending announcement of approved maximum prices dealings in copper, lead and zinc remain suspended on the London Metal Exchange. Tin was again traded yesterday, 475 tons changing hands at about Â£230 for cash and three months.",
