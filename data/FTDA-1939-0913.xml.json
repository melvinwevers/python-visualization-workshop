TUESDAY Evening. The'continued ease of money and the sustained demand for bills were again the main features of interest in Lombard Street to-day, where, inci- dentally, satisfaction was expressed at the decision to change Saturday banking hours back to \"pre-war\" time. The discount market was once more busily engaged in paying for new Treasury bills in view of the heavy quota obtained last Friday and this contributed to the larger turnover of paper to the clearing banks. As a general rule, these institutions acquired October maturities at 3% per cent., Novembers at 3% and Decembers at 3%, although, in places, finer rates were conceded. Business in the \" hot\" Treasury bills was reported down to 3X/ per cent., but, pending the Bank Rate decision to-morrow, leading houses adhered to 3% per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts. Short loans were readily available from the clearing banks at 3 per cent. against bills and 3% per cent. against bonds, but out- side accommodation could be secured at 2% per cent.

Sovereigns, therefore, were again 39s 3d. Silver prices again declined slightly as a result of speculative selling on a poorly supported market, spot and forward shedding %'d at 20%d per ounce in each case. Further adjustments were made in the foreign exchanges, the largest being in Swiss francs, which appreciated 10% cen- times to 17.84%. Norwegian kroner gained 3 points to 17.84%, while the French franc was restored to Saturday's level of 176%, a movement of 75 centimes in favour of sterling. The U.S. dollar rate was maintained at $4.04 middle, but Canadian dollars weak- ened 9 cents to $4.43.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 12th Sept. Heavy profit-taking took place in the Stock Market following yesterday's spec- tacular upswing, but an active upturn in the late dealings advanced the majority of the list by fractions to 2 points. The close was again strong. It was another big day, turnover totalling 4,170,000 shares-510,000 fewer than yesterday. The opening was strong and active, but the war boom soon faltered under realis- ing. Towards midday business turned quieter as the earlier gains were replaced by fairly general losses of fractions to a point. Industrials and Rails retained slight gains, but Sugars weakened follow- ing the suspension of the import quotas, American Sugar Refining dropping 5 points. In the early afternoon the market fluctuated considerably in face of profit- taking. Subsequently the list moved up and down at levels slightly above the day's lows, with declines at this juncture of fractions to a point in Steels, Aircrafts, Chemicals and Motors, and losses ranging to 2 points in Coppers and Merchandisings. Rails, Buildings and Utilities kept comparatively bright. In the final dealings, apart from a few soft spots, quotations rose under the leadership of Steels, Rails and Motors following new buying, as well as replace- ment purchases, in these groups, and the close was cheerful. Particular buoyancy was apparent in United States Steel, Chrysler and International Harvester. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average rose 0.80 to the new 1939 peak of 155.92, Rails advanced 1.55 to 32.85 and Utilities rallied 0.59 to 24.08. Dealings comprised 986 stocks, of which 415 im- proved, 374 receded and 197 were un- changed. _ ____ ______ ________.___ ( cllirllpau~ In the Bond market U.S. Governments rallied and Rails were firm; bond sales totalled $22,020,000, against $34,440,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was unchanged at 167.5. Engineering construction awards for the week to 7th September totalled $52,006,000, against $67,009,000 for the previous week and $52,456,000 a year ago. United States Steel Corporation's despatches of finished products for the first eight months total 5,873,397 tons, compared with 4,010,558 tons for the like period of 1938. The Curb Exchange short interest on 31st August was 10,007 shares, compared with 11,612 shares on 31st July. Allis-Chalmers dividend is 25c (same as previous quarter), payable 4th October to holders of 18th September. Borg-Warner dividend 25c (same as previous quarter), 1st October, 19th September. Electric Auto-Lite dividend 75c (same as previous quarter), 1st October, 20th September; total for year to date, $2 (whole of 1938, $1). General Electric dividend is again 25c, 25th October, 22nd September; nine months' total 75c (70c year a go). AVERAGES AND VOLUME CLOSE Hails Indus.

   "text_content" : "Yesterday's last-minute rush to arrange as far as possible the imme- diate pre-war position took up a good deal of time and occasioned a certain amount of friction. The selection of the eve of the. war (31st August) quotations as the Making-up prices for next week's Settlement was a very natural deci- sion. But probably unforeseen consequences followed from it being unaccompanied by any ruling or even recommendation by the Committee that clients should not be forced to sell at much below these prices. Make-up v. Present Prices Further selling yesterday of a more or less forced character arose from the fact that since 31st August many prices have moved far away from their then levels. In such cases members were not willing to renew contangoes and thus possibly become liable to pay heavy differences quite out of touch with current conditions. For example, Western Holdings are being made up at 13s 3d, against 11s 6d on 21st August. Thus, a taker- in for 21st September Settlement will be liable to pay Is 9d per share difference to the bull. Yet W. Hold- ings closed yesterday at only 8s' 3d, against which the taker-in will have agreed to lend 13s 3d. This is an extreme case, but it is representative of others where money-brokers formerly eager to taRe in stock will prefer this time to deliver it out of the box. W. Holdings are, of course, one of the most speculative of equities. But even with high-class Industrials takers-in were not too enthusiastic yesterday about lending much above current market prices. For instance, Imperial Tobacco are being made up at Â£6 10s and Woolworth at 63s. The former closed yesterday at Â£5 15s and the latter at 52s 6d. A Helpful Move One helpful move yesterday was an informal undertaking by the Inland Revenue to allow jobbers to keep stock in their names for an additional fortnight on the nominal ten-shilling stamp. Normally after two months a jobber must either make a genuine sale and delivery of such stock or pay the full Â£1 per Â£100 ad valorem. Rather than pay the full Â£1 there would doubtless have been special selling by jobbers-to.further confuse yesterday's rather awkward markets. Spectacular Yankees Yankees have risen so spectacularly since 31st August that anyone who was forced to sell yesterday to pro- vide funds must have taken handsome profits. It was the few remaining bears who were left in \"a worse dilemma than ever by the fresh boom on Wall Street overnight. United States Steel came over at a gross parity of 96, against 53 on 31st August, and Bethlehem at 122, against 64. There is still much discontent at the wideness of the margins between New York and London quotations for Americans. U.S. Steel and Bethlehem opened here yesterday morning at, re- spectively, 90 and 116, or about $6 each below the overnight parities shown in THE FINANCIAL TIMES Wall Street price lists. These parities, or equiva- lents, are, however, calculated at a cable transfer rate of $4.05 to the Â£. The effective rate is, I am told, nearer $4.18. Exchange Actualities The cable transfer rate can only be obtained when dealers have stock already in New York available for immediate delivery. Jobbers were working yesterday on a stock transfer rate of $4.18, which reduced the net parity of steel to 93 and Bethlehem to 118.. The $4.18 to the Â£ was what dealers expect to receive at sight when they hand the securities to the bank with the necessary documents. The 13 cents difference between the cable transfer and the stock transfer rates is reckoned to be sufficient to cover the bank's expenses ini shipping and insuring the securities. I gather that it was still being argued yesterday as to whether the Govern- ment insurance scheme under which the banks are working would cover indirect losses. If a ship carrying securities were sunk an arbitrageur would have to buy shares (possibly at much above the insured value of the original ship- ment) for as prompt delivery as pos- sible in order to avoid piling up back- wardation charges. w Ubtarterifst",

   "text_content" : "TUESDAY Evening. Budget uncertainties prevented any improvement of business in the Stock Exchange to-day. Dealing remained a matter of negotiation and quotations moved irregularly. Taxation possibilities again de- pressed Tobaccos, Breweries and other Industrial sections, and the main features of strength were Textile and Commodity shares. Most members are now resigned to gener- ally inactive markets until the 21st September Settlement has been com- pleted and the Chancellor's taxation proposals are known. The number of bargains marked in all sections was 2,434, against 2,508 yester- day. Business in the gilt-edged market showed signs of drying up, dealings at the minimum prices becoming increasingly difficult. Practically all British Government securities were changing hands at and within Y of their fixed prices. Consols 2% per cent. remained fractionally above their minimum and changed hands at from 62 to 62%. Conversion 4% per cent. was fairly active at from 100% to 101. Dealers were discussing the chances of some life being imparted to the market later on by a reduction in Bank Rate. Gilt-edged Prices Page 6 S. AMERICAN BONDS UP Bonds of some primary producing countries were the outstanding features of a quiet Foreign market. Chilean issues, interest in which is dependent on the sale of nitrate, iodine and copper, made advances varying from % to 2. Argentine issues also received attention; the 4% per cent.

Budget uncertainties prevented any improvement of business in the Stock Exchange to-day. Dealing remained a matter of negotiation and quotations moved irregularly. Taxation possibilities again de- pressed Tobaccos, Breweries and other Industrial sections, and the main features of strength were Textile and Commodity shares. Most members are now resigned to gener- ally inactive markets until the 21st September Settlement has been com- pleted and the Chancellor's taxation proposals are known. The number of bargains marked in all sections was 2,434, against 2,508 yester- day. Business in the gilt-edged market showed signs of drying up, dealings at the minimum prices becoming increasingly difficult. Practically all British Government securities were changing hands at and within Y. of their fixed prices. Consols 2Y per cent. remained fractionally above their minimum and changed hands at from 62 to 62Y2. Conversion 4% per cent. was fairly active at from 100% to 101. Dealers were discussing the chances of some life being imparted to the market later on by a reduction in Bank Rate. Gilt-edged Prices Page 6 S. AMERICAN BONDS UP Bonds of some primary producing countries were the outstanding features of a quiet Foreign market. Chilean issues, interest in which is dependent on the sale of nitrate, iodine and copper, made advances varying from Y2 to 2. Argentine issues also received attention; the 4Y per cent. Conversion gained a point to 76Y2 and the 3V2 per cent. bonds put on Y to 63 X. In Austrians an anomalous movement appeared and, while the 5 per cent. bonds shed 3 points to 10, the 4% per cent. issue was marked up from 35 to 40. Foreign Bond Prices Page 6 HOME RAILS EASIER While the immediate future of the home railways continues to be matter for specu- lation, lacking a Government announce- ment of policy, Ordinary stocks are in- clined to weakness. Yesterday scattered selling left L.M.S. a point lower at 10 and Southern Deferred receded to 8, as com- pared with 9 previously. Purchasers of prior charge stocks at the minimum prices were again scarce and little business was done. In the Foreign list the speculator con- tinued to support the Argentine issues. The rise continued with a further gain to 24 by B.A.G.S. 5 per cent. Preference, while the Ordinary put on % to 9%. Central Argentine, Ehtre Rios and Anto- fagasta also made headway. A few sellers of Nord 6 per cent. bonds came to market and the closing quotation was 1 point lower at 86. Indian Rails remained firm with all markings as before. Jobbers quoted American prices 1 to 3 points higher in sympathy with Wall Street's overnight trend. New York Central was again the only active stock in London and put on a further 1% to 21%. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 6 INDUSTRIALS INACTIVE More Sellers Present, but Firm Features Not Lacking Trading in the Industrial market pro- ceeded on quiet lines and few outstanding price movements resulted. Generally the tone was dull and, with more sellers about, prices were inclined to pursue a downward course in most sections. Again it was left to Shipping shares and low-priced Tex- tiles to provide the bright features, but the turpover in these groups was com- paratively light. There was a disposition to sell BANKING shares and although the realisatiosns were light a weak undertone developed. Mid- land Bank Â£2 10s issues were down %, as were Barclays \" A.\" National Provincial (Â£1 paid) were down 3s to 57s 6d and Westminsters 2s to 69s 6d. For the most part INSURANCE shares were steady and the few recessions were merely fractional. Alliance (new) closed firmer at 21%., Business in ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT issues continued on a narrow basis and inquiry was limited to two or three shares. Among these, Ever Readys gained 6d further to 22s 9d. Fesih weakness was shown by several ELECTRICITY shares on fears of reduced revenues as a result of the black-out. The vulnerable spot was County of London Electric, which further relapsed 3s 6d to 32s 6d. Metropolitan Electrics were down 2s to 39s. Victoria Falls Powers receded 2s 6d to 62s 6d. In COMMUNICATIONS the buying of Cana- dian Marconis was resumed and the shares rose 6d to 6s 6d. Cable and Wireless Preference fell 2 to 80. Raleigh Cycle Holdings advanced 2e 6d to 45s in anticipation of a demand for pedal cycles. MOTOR shares, on the other hand, were neglected on fears of a fresh increase in car taxation. Standards weak- ened 3s 6d to 10s and Austin \"A\" 2s 6d to 22s 6d. Rovers were down Is 9d to 13s 9d and Morris Is 3d to 27s 6d. Rolls-Royce and Leylands were each %6 lower. No fresh quotable changes were made in Dunlops and Triplex Glass. SHIPBUILDINGS RISE Fresh appreciation occurred in SHIPPING issues. Demand mainly was for shares of cargo lines. Furness Withy changed up to 25s and left off at 24s 3d. Coast Lines were strong with a jump of Is 6d to 13s rather buyers. Lamport arid Holts at 9s and Cairn Lines at 6s were 6d better. Alexander Shippings were mentioned at 17s. Cunards were 5s bid. In SHIPBUIID- ING, Harland and Wolff were good, chang- ine up to 11s 3d, while interest was apae anwilth 5pecn.bod revivea in Richardsons Westgarth around 4s 3d. Swan Hunters rallied to 31s 6d. Business in STEEL issues was restricted to a few shares. On the recent meeting, Richard Thomas were firmer at 3s 6d and the. Preference Is up at lls 6d. Dealings in John Browns, Vickers and B.S.A. were. small. Indian Irons were a feature with a fresh jump of 7s 6d to 52 6d. Imperial Chemical Ordinary and Preference reacted Jd each on small sales. Borax Deferred were 2s 6d higher at 23e 9d, but Murex eased 2s 6d to 75s. United Molasses were active and changed up to 27s, but closed unaltered at 25s 9d. Elsewhere, Sudan Plantations were 2s 3d up at 29s 9d. Prices among TEXTILES advanced more sharply than the limited turnover war- ranted, but shares were in short supply, and this accounted for the streilgth of the market. Fine Spinners Preference vPre Is 9d higher at 9s. Bradford Dyers gaified 10d to 5s 6d and tohe Preference IS to 7s o6. RAYONS were leatureless. It became difficult to sell BREWERY shares owing to the widespread taxation fears. Benskins, which closed last night around 62s, changed to-day as low as 50s. This was the weak spot. Courage were 6s 3d down at 55s and Meux 3s 6d lower at 22s 6d. Distillers fell Is 6d to 90s. TOBACCOS remained weakish, but fresh recessions were light. British American closed %' down at 4, while Imperials and Carreras \"A \" were each % lower. Leading STORE issues were dull with Woolworths and Marks and Spencer lower. Changes among FOODSTUFFS were small. Aerated Breads fell 9d to 15s 9d. Feature in American Industrials was further jump in U.S. Steels from 81 to 90%. Bethlehems were quoted 115, Repub- lics 32%, Youngstown Sheet 63, Chrysler 103 and General Motors 63. Industrial Share Prices Page 6 ROYAL DUTCH ADVANCE The OIL market continued to share the favour accorded to commodity sections and several issues enjoyed further improve- ment. The volume of business still was restricted by the technical difficulties con- nected with dealing in present circum- stances but a moderate demand was encountered for several of the leading issues. Outstanding among price movements was a fresh sharp advance in Royal Dutch which improved steadily throughout the session, partly as a result of Amsterdam buying. Shells were %, better again at 4'%2 and Shell-Unions were marked up % to 18%. Both Anglo-Iranians at 3% and Burmahs at 3%. held their former levels, although declines were shown by the Anglo-Iranian Preference stocks. Further headway was made by some of the Trinidad issues, Leaseholds rising %e more to 4%', Apex 9d to 24s 9d and Trini- dad Petroleum Developments 6d to 48s. Some of the South American issues also were favoured again and Lobitos rose %e to 1\"/i and Anglo-Ecuadorians Is to 18s. Oil prices Page 6 RUBBERS FIRM Inquiries for Rubber shares were fairly general, and a moderate number of bar- gains were recorded. Quotations where altered usually continued their improve- ment, but there was some small selling of certain leading descriptions. Highlands lost is 6d at 22s 3d, and Telogoredjo were a shade cheaper at 16s, together with United Serdang at 3s 3d. Rubber Trust, however, held their ground at 28s 9d. Grand Central were in keen request, and the price jumped Is 3d to lls 3d. Malayalam added another is at 30s. Tamiang were bought for invest- ment and moved up 7%d to 20s 7%d. The market finished firm after a fair day's business. On the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange Rubber shares were steady. Anglo-Dutch were dealt in at 27s 6d and 27s 9d. Grand Central realised 12s, and there were still buyers at the close. Bikam were on offer at 2s 2d and Mambau at around 10s. In- quiry for shares showed a broadening tendency. The raw rubber market opened steadily with the forward positions dearer. October-December was 10%d, January- March 10%d, and April-June 10%d per pound. Business throughout the session was fair. Closing prices are as follow, with the preceding day's quotations in parentheses: - Spot 10Ysd (10%d), September 10d (10%d), October 10%d (10%d), October-December 10%d (10%d), January-March 10%d (10%d), April-June 10%d (10%d). Stock Exchange quotations for Tea shares were irregular. Jas. Finlay were bought from the North and advanced Is 3d to 45s. Consolidated Estates were wanted on the company's rubber interests. The price finished at 32s 6d, against 31s 10%d yesterday afternoon. Rubber and Tea prices Page 6 GOLD SHARES DECLINE Sharp Rises in Tins-Broken Hills Firm Gold shares remained depressed. Selling to close up contango positions was again thought to be the chief reason for the lower prices, especially in the non-produc- ing issues. Demand was scanty. In Kaffirs the fact that Johannesburg turned a cheap buyer towards the close did not prevent quotations being generally down on balance. Dealing with the Cape was easier than yesterday. West Africans were looking a shade firmer towards the finish. Hopes that these mines may be allowed to retain anyway the greater part of the extra benefit accruing from the sharply increased gold price were bringing in bargain hunters. Among Base-metal issues, Rhodesian Coppers were quieter, .but profit-taking reduced quotations by only small amounts compared with recent gains. Tins came into the limelight on the rise in the.output quota under the restriction scheme. Shares were difficult to buy, and prices went ahead sharply in some instances. Of Lead-Zincs, the Barrier group remained firm, the Commonwealth still being a buyer of these issues, but a corresponding seller of West Australian Gold shares. In the Kaffir group, West Wits. fell % further to 3, Libanon 9d to.6s 9d, Blyvoor 9d to 4s 9d, Western Reefs A. to %. and Western Holdings Is 9d to 8s 3d. Palmiet- kuils dropped 9d to 3s 3d and Vlakfontein %. to %. Declines in the producers ranged up to %, in Crown at 15%. DiamodLa sagged. De Beers Deferred declined to 58%, the Preference % to 8%, Anglo Trust %s to % and Consoli- dated of South West Africa Preference 9d to 5s 6d. Among West Africans, Bibiani rose 6d to 27s and Artston 3d to lls 3d, but Gold Coast Selection gave way 6d to 17s .6d. it remamnea amcuit to aeal in inooesan Gold shares and prices were marked back. RHODESIAN SELECTION UP A feature of RhodesJan Coppers was a jump, of 9d to 16s 6d in Rhodesian Selec- tion, on the theory that the shares had become undervalued compared with Roan, which, after easing to 19s, cl9sed un- changed at their recently advanced level of 19s' d. Rhokana reacted % to 18%. Chartered rose 9d to 20s. Largest advance among Tins was one of 8s to 18s in Bangrin. Pahang jumped 2s 9d to. 15s 8d, Southern Kinta % to '., Southern Malayan to '%/. In the Barrier rou Zinc Ordinary rose %i further to:3%, North Broken Hill %..to I*/, and New Broken Hill 3d to 14s 3d. Mining share prices Page 6 Complete list of Making-up Prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "Gilt-edged stocks a little easier to buy at a small advance over the mini- mum prices than to sell at the minima; Brewery shares heavy again on fears of taxation; Shipping shares once more in the ascendant but disposed to react from the best; Sudan Syndicates spurting on cotton prospects; Textiles mostly harder; Oil shares maintaining a firm front; Rubbers very quiet; Tobaccos steadier. This sums up fairly clearly the course of yesterday's dealings in the Old House. A little business during the morning was succeeded by a stag- nant patch after lunch, and at 2 o'clock, when the House closed, there was nothing doing. The Mining markets had little to distinguish them except minor fluctua- tions in Rhodesian Copper shares and more inquiries than orders for Base- metal descriptions. The Budget Barrier Announcement of the Supplemen- tary Budget and its details are awaited with an accumulating inte- rest. Not until these are known is it likely that the wheels of Stock Ex- change business will revolve with any approach to normal activity. When the provisions are published and it becomes possible to guess even approximately what a company can be expected to earn we shall see Stock Exchange business revive in the commercial and industrial markets. Until then the uncertainty of the Budget's demands will act as a barrier between enterprise and capital. Cash v. Shares The question as to which is the better to have at the moment, money in the bank or sound Ordinary shares, exercises a good many minds. In the House the opinion seems to favour the view that Ordinary shares in com- panies that deal with the essential commodities, such, for instance, as Tate and Lyle, Shell Transport, Im- perial Tobacco, ought to be better worth holding than actual cash, what- ever may happen to the dividends for a while. When the day of victory arrives Ordinary shares in such companies are likely to stand higher relatively than the prices of gilt-edged securi- ties and to be of greater value than cash at the bank to-day. The Chairman The Stock Exchange and the nation at large are fortunate in having at the head of affairs in the House so wise and capable, so hard-working and ex- perienced, a man as Mr. Robert Pearson, chairman of the Committee for General Purposes. The cool sanity that characterises his judgment and the confidence that this inspires are of a value which no exag- gerated eulogy would convey with a tenth part of the appreciation that a homely little tribute such as this will, however inadequately, express.

It is understood from Canberra that the gold-mining companies will escape the increased company taxation imposed in the Federal Budget.

   "article_dc_title" : "Closing Open Accounts",
   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange has been find- ing it difficult to make the most of the restricted scope afforded by cash deal- ings until outstanding pre-war bar- gains are completed. The Settlement was postponed from 7th to 21st September, and the making-up prices preliminary to the closing of open accounts have now been fixed. As will be seen from the full list repro- duced elsewhere in this issue, the quotations are those of 31st August. The closing of the House in the first days of September makes it necessary to lengthen the gap between the date of the making-up prices and the actual Settlement, but it will be found that there are not many drastic changes in values as compared with the previous Account. In spite of the untoward circumstances, moreover, movements are by no means all in favour of the bears. The great point, then, is that the way is cleared for the virtual elimina- tion of the small open Account which was all that was outstanding. All new business is on a cash basis, but it was permissible for old contango business to be continued and notified yesterday if members so wished. Only a small remnant of such accounts has, in fact, been carried over. That was only to be expected. The financ- ing of such commitments always entails a risk, of course, but the individual member is as well aware of the undesirability of perpetuating a speculative position now, generally speaking, as are the Stock Exchange Committee and the Treasury. The present situation, apart from the elements of danger which would lie in the financing of speculation, is such that it is exceptionally difficult to \"take a view\" with any assurance that it is likely to prove the correct one. That in itself would be a deterrent, even if any other than cash transactions were allowed. What are the factors, apart from the war itself, obscuring the outlook? Whether the brewing industry will again fall a prey to the Chancellor in his prospective search for revenue from taxation cannot yet be said, but the state of the market in the shares indicates the darkest foreboding. Ship- ping shares and low-priced Textile issues, on the other hand, yesterday re- flected hopes of expanded activity. Quite probably they will prove justi- fied, for fundamentals have not been altered, and, broadly speaking, such benefits as are to be reaped will fall to equity shares. The difficulty is to gauge the extent of those benefits- that is, profit-earning capacity-in the light of modern conditions. Of equal import to taxation are the directions Government control will take and the extent to which it will be applied. Such things will become clearer ere long, and then the adjusted mechanism of the Stock Exchange will show to the best advantage.",

   "text_content" : "A substantial increase in profit and a reduced dividend would be anoma- lous under conditions other than those prevailing. The decision of the Cannock Associated Collieries to re- strict the total dividend for the past year to 9 per cent. on the Ordinary capital, as compared with 10 per cent. for the previous period, is clearly evi- dence of caution, since profits have risen by as much as Â£38,000 to Â£207,000. After providing for Prefer- ence dividends this represents earn- ings of over 14 per cent. on the junior capital. The company, with a capital of almost Â£2,600,000, is a substantial amalgamation of three Staffordshire undertakings. Operations have obvi- ously benefited by the expansion of demand for coal this year and by the better prices ruling. Under war con- ditions the future is uncertain, although there seems no reason to fear that the collieries, producing an essential raw material, will suffer. The Â£1 Ordinary shares are quoted at 26s 3d, at which they yield about 61 per cent. on the basis of the latest dividend.",

Income is derived from the operating Trojan company, and also from the investment in Beans Industries. The subsidiary's profit in the past year jumped to Â£41,800 from Â£25,000 for the preceding period of ten months, and out of the former figure only Â£22,000 was allocated to the Holdings company. The profit increase was due not to larger profit margins but to a considerable rise in output. Conservatism, Mr. Blow emphasised, is necessary at the present time in view of the many unusual expenses incurred, including the cost of the new factory in course of erection. In general, he expressed himself very well satisfied with the progress made by the company during the year. In future, it is to be presumed, the \"more urgent work\" to which he referred will continue to take pre- cedence over the vehicle side of the company's operations.",

The company was fortunate in having its extensions to buildings and plant completed well in. time for the extra demands made on its services during the past year. Accelerated activity in aircraft and other work resulted in an enormously increased turnover, which resulted in a profit for the parent com- pany nearly double that of the preced- ing period. Recognition of the neces- sity for conserving resources is indi- cated by the substantial allocation to reserve, which has already placed the business in a gratifying position of strength. Good results have come from all the operating subsidiaries, which confirm the value of the extensions and organisation carried on during the past few years. Expansion in certain cases has-involved the formation of new subsidiaries, in order to deal with the heavy demand for certain types of highly specialised work. In view of the very serious burden of taxation the company has done well in reserv- ing enough for two years, which will reduce the drain on future earnings.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Sterling Not Blocked",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "Little surprise but considerable satisfaction was expressed in banking and Money market circles at yester- day's decision of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers to revert to the hour of 12 noon for closing on Saturdays on and after 16th Septem- ber. Opening will be half-an-hour earlier-that is, 9.30 a.m. For years the City had been accus- tomed to making all its financial arrangements before noon and the additional hour was found unneces- sary. Recognition of the circum- stances, doubtless following represen- tations, has been prompt. Before long, probably, other alterations may be made. A view prevails here and there that during the war the banks should close altogether on Saturdays. This would involve shopkeepers, other traders and the general public in some inconveni- ence. It would also cause a certain amount of dislocation in respect of discount and exchange business. Correcting Errors An impression seems to have been formed in some quarters that sterling is a blocked currency. It is nothing of the kind and the sooner that idea is eradicated the better. The rules and regulations which have been introduced by necessity may be irksome and liable to cause delays. Except for enemy aliens there is no ban on the transfer of funds for legitimate purposes. Exchange will be granted, except in special and unusual cases, to make payments in respect of pre-war debts for genuine commercial business, and for defraying proper travelling pur- uoses. There is no impediment in the way of non-British residents exporting gold from this country. Only in exceptional instances have non-residents who have sold their gold in London been refused permission to transfer the sterling proceeds abroad. Two other points which require emphasis once again are (a) that traders and private individuals should continue to deal through their own bankers and (b) that postal, orders are legal tender. In regard to (a) there has been a tendency to go to authorised dealers only. This is not intended by the new regulations. With regard to (b) there are still cases where shopkeepers and others are improperly declining to accept postal orders in payment.",

   "text_content" : "Both in .matter and brevity the ad- dress of Mr. Eric Miller at yesterday's meeting of the Bajoe Kidoel Rubber and Produce Company testifies to the abnormal conditions now prevailing. The point of most interest to share- holders is that the estates are in good order and under capable management, and will be kept going efficiently at minimum expense. Unlike many in- dustrial undertakings, producers of primary commodities, such as rubber, will find their business an essential factor in conditions imposed by a war economy. The estates are in the Netherlands East Indies, and a well deserved tribute is paid to the Dutch authorities for fair treatment, which is only to be expected from a nation whose ideas of freedom and equitable dealing are very similar to those held in this country. Like other plantation concerns, the company found its unit cost increased for both rubber and coffee owing to smaller crops. The lower price for coffee, combined with the effect of propaganda by Brazilian producers, has considerably raised the offtake of coffee in the United States. The crop was nevertheless disappointing, and is not likely to be improved much while production remains far in excess of actual or potential consumption. On the other hand, the outlook for rubber may be considered more promising.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "The proposal of Cinzano to seek powers to issue bearer share warrants if required concerns the public in this country, as it affects the \" A\" Ordin- ary shares, which are dealt in on the Stock Exchange. Certain com- plications would beset the holder registered here who desired to change the character of his security. The company is registered in Canada and transfer from the existing register here to that in Montreal would be the first requisite. On conversion, the matter of stamp duty would be im- portant if it were desired to negotiate the bearer warrants in London. Before he could transfer them, the owner would have to pay the rela- tively heavy duty of 4s per Â£10 nominal. This would cover the war- rant for its whole life, and the holder probably would be able to get back part, at least, of the duty in a con- sequential higher price for the bearer form. There is no compulsion to make any change at all and the new privilege doubtless has been sought by investors having specific reasons for preferring bearer shares.",

H., Leamington-It is impossible to fix selling limits, as dealings in these shares are mainly by negotiation. They should, however, be worth holding. The capital structure and earning power differs materially since the last war. H. D.-Many of these are speculative shares and not in demand just now. Only alterna- tive to selling at a sacrifice is to retain them for the present. Fall in No. 3 is due to sales by holders who believe that all the favourable factors have now been dis- counted. Whether Nos. 7, 11 and 15 do well under present conditions will depend upon what contracts come the way of the com- panies. Our view is favourable. J. M.-The last news was that delivery delays would prevent completion of the plant until November or December. It is possible that the war may cause some further postpone- ment. Ken-The utility concern has large holdings of depressed U.S. public utility shares, none of which is likely to benefit from war con- ditions. The Holdings company is interested largely in first-named concern. As both shares come within the Treasury Order as to registration we see no object in averaging.

   "article_dc_title" : "Tin Export Quota up 20% to 80%",
   "text_content" : "The International Tin Committee decided yesterday to raise the export quota for the third quarter of the year by 20 per cent. to 80 per cent. of standard tonnages. Tin was unchanged at Â£230 a ton for cash and three months, after a turnover of 525 tons. A number of Tin shares were marked up sharply. The Committee's decision supersedes that announced barely ten days ago whereby the release for the months of July, August and September was advanced from 45 per cent. to 60 per cent., an amount also scheduled for the final quarter of 1939. No change has been made in the fourth quarter allowance, but according to a statement issued by the Chairman of the Com- mittee yesterday the position will be reviewed \"if that should appear at any time to be advisable.\" The 20 per cent. quota increase to the highest level since December, 1937, involves a theoretical addition to the monthly permissible exports from signatory countries of about 3,470 tons to 13,850 tons. gIS -v .voIU LV e e o t eI current quarter period the increased quota might seem to indicate the need for a violent upswing in pro- duction. This need not be so in all producing areas as large stocks of concentrates are known to have been accumulated in Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies. As Billiton tin is expected to be sent to Singapore or Penang for smelting instead of to Holland, a sharp increase in the supplies of Straits tin should be quickly available. HIGH EASTERN PRICE Â£257 a Ton f.o.b. In the London market the Com- mittee's decision is regarded as a measure to relieve the threatened scarcity of supplies and check the rise in prices. Although the official London Metal Exchange price has not exceeded Â£230 a ton-the Buffer Pool maximum-this refers to common tin. English tin is quoted at Â£240 a ton, and in the East Straits tin has been traded at Â£257 f.o.b., equivalent to about Â£270 c.i.f. in New York. Although there is some surprise that the Committee has been forced so soon to revise its quota arrangements dealers have recognised that steps would have to be taken to increase supplies for reasonably early delivery especially in view of the phenominally heavy buying in London and the United States recently. In the five trading days since the London Metal Exchange reopened last Wednesday more than 4,000 tons have changed hands, an amount sometimes not exceeded in the whole of a slack summer month. Owing to the rigid export licens- ing system business in London has been predominantly on home and Empire account. Consumers have been anxious to secure the supplies available in this coun- try, believing that additional metal may be difficult to get below Â£230 a ton owing to the heavy war risk insurance rates on shipments from the East. HEAVY PURCHASES Stocks Falling American consumers have also been active buyers. This is partly due to the upward trend of U.S. industrial activity- as shown by the 12 per cent. rise in steel operations last week to over 70 per cent. of capacity-partly to a desire to hold larger stocks in case war should interfere with or delay deliveries. Recent heavy purchases have reduced substantially the supplies at the disposal of the Buffer Pool. And the latest quota decision has presumably been influenced by a desire to prevent an undue scarcity of supplies which would both denude the Pool of stock's and impair further its ability to control prices. It is already apparent that the present price range of Â£200-Â£230 a ton aimed at by the Pool is applicable only to the less sought-after brands of tin. There is nothing sacrosanct about such limits, which may be varied by a resolu- tion of the Committee. The possibility of such revision cannot be excluded in view of the depreciation of sterling and the fact that dealings have been taking place at a substantial premium. Comin l t th d f h",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT PARIS, 12th Sept. The Bourse has proved resistant to the shock of exchange control. Pending de- tailed interpretation of the decrees, brokers have suspended transactions with persons outside French territory. Trading in foreign securities, except between Frenchmen, is prohibited. The Bourse authorities have decided not to allow commitments to be increased beyond the volume at the last Settlement, and excess positions must be liquidated at the first Settlement. On the Coulisse the Carry-over has been suspended. The exchanges are stable with apparent equilibrium, but business is thin. Control is gradually organising, but is not ex- pected to be in full operation until next week. Local American brokerage houses are not accepting buying or selling orders pending official clarification of the new decrees. It is expected that they will close down eventually. COPENHAGEN BOURSE COPENHAGEN, 12th Sept. The Stock Exchange, which had been closed since the outbreak of war, was re- opened to-day. Strict regulations were in force to prevent speculation. Dealings automatically ceased when the maximum and minimum variations fixed from the last quotation on 31st August were reached. Turnover of bonds totalled Kr.1,300,000. Practically all were kept at the official minimum level, which allowed a fall .of 2 per cent. Turnover in shares was small. In the absence of sellers banks sold a quarter beyond the 2 per cent. limit, so that dealings were stopped. Shippings jum d the full 15 -er nll V V ce . a owe .

   "text_content" : "Outbreak of war has raised in acute form problems with which property- owning companies have been struggling for many months. In some instances at least the actual outcome of the first week of war has proved less detrimental in its effects than had been feared. From the City itself there has been a large-scale exodus not only of the smaller businesses but also of the larger under- takings. On the other hand, there is already a drift back. Not only individuals but also some of the greater concerns which had split their organisations into several parts and evacuated to areas out- side London have begun to consider the possibility of returning. In this two major factors have to be weighed. The first is the difficulty in transacting business under the new con- ditions. Offsetting this, the second, the undesirability in the national interest of returning to the City since Government policy continues to favour dispersion. There is also possibility that events may prove London to be by no means the least safe area in the country in view ds its defences. From a revenue viewpoint there is no doubt that property companies in London generally are suffering. On the other hand, since capital values are represented more by the sites than by the buildings upon them, it is held that their position is by no means as vulnerable as might appear superficially. Companies with properties well spread in the London area have not found that leases are falling in with undue rapidity. In some cases people who had intimated their intention of terminating their agree- ments have decided to renew them, at least for the time being. There has been no tendency to break agreements or to endeavour to compound liabilities.",

   "text_content" : "Hotel companies, which have been in a depressed condition for many months as a result of the political uncertainties which culminated in the outbreak of war, anticipate that when the community settles down to war-time conditions thev may enjoy more .active trade. Those with properties in safety areas are already feeling the benefit of the numbers of people who have left London and other densely populated centres. This does not make good the extremely poor trade which is passing in London, but it is thought that this may improve later on. It is pointed out that there will always be a large population in London, notwith- standing efforts to disperse its inhabitants. When the community becomes more accus- tomed to the nightly \"black-out\" there will probably be. a greater tendency to patronise hotels. War-time experience generally indicates that places of enter- tainment flourish at such times. Freer spending is general. It is not anticipated that stringent restrictions will be placed upon hotels. Even under a rationing scheme it is likely that it will be possible to pro^nce good and attractive menus. On the other'hand, it is realised that the lavish expenditure which characterised 1914-18 will not take place upon the present occasion. Hoteliers are awaiting developments. Much wilt depend-upon the vulnerability of London. - '",

   "text_content" : "Shipping shares generally were again good on the Stock Exchange yesterday, with cargo carrying descriptions in phrticular request. As the supply of shares was limited quotations were marked up accordingly. Textiles improved, but Tobaccos and Breweries were lower on increased taxation fears. All members were not pessimistic regarding the prospects of tobacco companies, the view being taken in some quarters that sales will considerably increase during the war period. Brewery shares were practi- cally unsaleable. Rubber shares improved on the belief that war conditions will create a more favourable market for the producers. Gilt-edged descriptions remained at or around the minimum prices, at which deal- ing tended to become more difficult. The market impression is that the minima will be made more effective by a reduction in Bank Rate. The Stock Exchange generally was quiet under the influence of Budget uncertainties and the Settlement due to take place on 21st September. It is possible that the Committee will to-day issue special regu- lations relating to the pending Settlement which was postponed from 7th September. CONTANGO RATES In a notice issued yesterday members were reminded that the Committee decided on 7th September that the continuation rates for the extended period 7th Septem- ber to 21st September should not exceed 2 per cent. above the rates at which the securities were carried over from 24th August to 7th September. The Stock Exchange position now in course of settlement has been greatly re- duced by compliance with the wish of the authorities that continuations should be closed wherever possible. Sharp rises in Americans and in some other speculative sections have assisted the closing of bull accounts. Contango rates charged were in many sections below the 2 per cent. over the end- August rates fixed as a maximum advance by the Committee. In the Foreign Bond market and the Oil share market the general rate was about 1 per cent. up. Among Mines from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. more than at end- August was charged for the Carry-over and the same increase ruled for many Industrials. Jobbers in many cases were not doing contangoes in the normal way. In such cases accommodation was frequently given by the broker concerned. CLEARING ARRANGEMENTS In order to facilitate the work of the Settlement Department of the Stock Ex- change in connection with the postpone- ment until 21st September of the Settle- ment of bargains open for 7th September Account, members and firms must send in their clearing lists by 2.30 p.m. to-day. The Settlement Department has also prepared for guidance a list of clearing securities, published on Page Five, which may be affected by the Defence (Finance) Regulations.

Industrials this time were not so prominent as Rails, which rose sharply, while Utilities recovered. Busi- ness continued extremely active, turnover totalling 4,170,000 shares, or 510,000 fewer than yesterday. The initial realising was based on the theory that a technical reaction is now overdue following the lengthy advance, the result of which has been to raise some pivotal shares by $30 to $40 since the beginning of hostilities. Speculative enthusiasm was also cooled by reports that the proposed amendment of the Neutrality Act would be fought by a number of prominent Republicans in the Senate.

As previously stated, it is not the intention that priority shall be exercised over the whole field of industry. There will be no general issue of priority certificates in connection with Government work, states the Ministry of Information, and such certificates will only be issued where difficulties arise between the com- peting demands arising from an immediate shortage or non-availability of production capacity, labour, raw materials, transport or any other cause. In the case of difficulties arising in the execution of a contract or order, con- tractors should refer to the Government Department concerned in the isque of the order (or the appropriate Government De- partment in the case of civil industry). If necessity is proved, the appropriate Department will receive authority from the Ministry of Supply to issue priority certificates. If difficulty is found in the supply of a raw material which is subject to the control of the Minister of Supply inquiries should be addressed to the appropriate control.",

The suspension makes immediately available some 800,000 tons of domestic sugar held in reserve, apart from large surpluses from Cuba and other countries. However, Cuban imports may be restricted by the imposition of the full 11 cents duty made mandatory by the suspension of the quota.-Reuter.

   "text_content" : "It is understood that the Board of Trade is now relaxing its previous attitude in insisting rigidly upon com- pliance with the exact terms of applica- tions for war risk insurance under the compulsory Commodity Insurance Scheme. Where the original applica- tion was made in error for an amount in excess of actual requirements, per- mission to modify the amount for which application has been made is being considered. EFFECT ON BUSINESS This does not, however, remove the concern which is being felt in business and commercial circles over the main features of the scheme. In some cases where merchants have financed large purchases of stocks by bor- rowing they are unable to pay the very considerable sums demanded as premiums. Jewellers are finding it particularly diffi- cult to find the big amounts of money representing the premium on their stocks. The operation of the scheme has been described, in interested circles as an un- equally applied tax on capital. It is understood that strong protests are being made by representative institutions to the Government and that pending the result of these many from whom premiums are due are refraining from any action in the matter. LLOYD'S STILL IN LONDON A report circulated yesterday to the effect that Lloyd's has removed to premises in Berkshire is incorrect. The headquarters of Lloyd's and the under- writing business of the marine insurance companies is still centred in Lloyd's Build- ing in Leadenhall-street, and only in a very grave emergency, it is understood, will the underwriting room tid other business departments remove from Lloyd's Build- ing to the country. FARMS EXEMPT Certain agricultural and horticultural products on the farm are to be excluded from the scope of the War Risks Insur- ance Act. They include growing crops, plants and trees, and also live stock and crops so long as they are on farms occupied by the farmer who has produced them.",

His speech will be made on the motion for adjourn- ment. This means that there can be a general debate, but the Government hopes it will be short. Emergency legislation will be taken, including the Control of Labour Bill, and this will occupy the House again to- morrow, when Parliament will rise until the following Wednesday. Questions are also to be put to-day to the Prime Minister regarding the Govern- ment's plans for a Ministry of Shipping and, possibly, the insurance of property against war damage. A Government Committee is studying this latter question, but the urgency of the matter is being impressed on the authorities by many Members of Parliament."

The Texas Railroad Commission has voted to increase the daily allowable pro- duction of East Texas crude oil by 110,000 barrels, making the State allowable output until 1st November'some 1,527,000 barrels. The action, which seems to have been promoted by the prospects of an increased European demand, is tending to throw doubt on the much-discussed probability of an early advance in crude oil prices. Domestic production of petrol in July. according to the American Bureau of Mines, totalled 51,896,000 barrels, com- pared with 50,861,000 in June.

The French Government had pre- viously informed the U.S. Government of its plans, in accordance with the terms of che Tripartite Agreement.

In addition, there is a carry-over of some 95 million bushels, so that the country is in about the same position as a year ago when a bumper crop brought in 360 million bushels. Crops of secondary cereals are also stated to be excellent.",

   "text_content" : "The annual general meeting of Clifford Motor Components, Ltd., was held yester- day at Birmingham. MR. ALBERT GOOD (the chairman) presided. The Secretary (Mr. W. G. Elcock, F.C.A.) having read the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors, The Chairman said:-I am glad to see the members who are here to-day, and if the attendance is small, a sparsely attended annual general meeting is usually a sign of general satisfaction. We are here for a specific purpose, and therefore I propose to carry on our meet- ing in a normal way without harping on the dreadfully serious situation. I know we shall all do our best and I know that we shall go on until we arrive at a successful issue. I should wish to say that, while we have managed to issue the directors' report and balance-sheet this year before the end of July, it was accomplished with difficulty and undesirable encroachment on the week-ends and other free time of the staff -for this reason we propose next year to send out the report, etc., on 1st September. It is my privilege to move the adoption of the report and accounts, and the recom- mendation of the Board in respect of divi- dend, etc., and I may say that the results of the year's operations which they show make it a pleasant privilege. These accounts have been in your hands for some time and I assume it will be agreeable to you that I take them as read. We have had another record year of progress. Good use has been made of the several extensions to buildings and plant of the operating factories and the aggre- gate turnover has been enormously in- creased over and above the previous year -which was in itself a record-and, as you see, the dividends receivable from them consequent on that turnover gives the parent company a net profit of Â£90,806, as against Â£47,616 for the last year which, I am quite sure, you will regard with satisfaction. DIVIDEND AND BONUS It is gratifying to your Board to be able to present such figures to you and to re- commend the payment of a final dividend of 12% per cent. plus a bonus of 10 per cent. which, together with the interim dividend of 7% per cent. paid last December, is equivalent to a cash distribution of 30 per cent., less tax, for the year (as against 20 per cent., less tax, for the previous year) and further to propose the allocation of Â£45,000 to general reserve, with an in- creased carry-forward of Â£22,051. It will be appreciated that our recommendation to carry this sum to general reserve further strengthens the financial position of the company and I am sure you will agree this is a judicious and right thing to do, par- ticularly at this time. This reserve will then stand at Â£85,000, or just 50 per cent. of the share capital-I think a strong situation. The additional amount carried forward will assist to keep us well in funds and help towards the further outlay on new plant and machinery we contemplate. The policy of the directors to plough back in-o the businesses of the subsidiaries a considerable proportion of the profits by way of extensions to buildings and plant and general development over the past three or four years has made possible the greatly increased turnover with augmented profits and dividends. The year has been a period of anxious activity on the part of your Board, who have continually under consideration pro- jects for the increase and widening of the base of your company's businesses, which is their definite object and policy. AERO VALVE FACTORY FULLY EMPLOYED I reported last year that the Aero Valve factory of Motor Components was fully equipped and assured of full work for a couple of years or more. The demand upon us for these highly specialised valves increases, but the space at our disposal allowed only comparatively small exten- sion of existing shops. Consequently we have had to look elsewhere. I am glad to say that we have been fortunate in being able to acquire for cash the very fine modern works and equipment of the New Imperial Motors, Ltd. This building consists mainly of a single ground floor light and lofty shop covering 1% acres, with commodious offices and plenty of room for any possible extension; the whole site contains five acres of free- hold land at one level. This acquisition in our opinion is ideal for our purposes- present and prospective. A new subsidiary company---Clifford Aero and Auto, Ltd.-has been formed to take over and operate part of these new works. About one-third of the factory has been rented by Motor Components, Ltd., enabling that subsidiary to put down addi- tional plant to cater for the increased de- mand for their product. The rest of the works is engaged in the production of aeroplane parts and assemblies, and orders are already in hand to occupy them fully for more than twelve months ahead. The existing plant has been rearranged on an entirely different layout appropriate to the new class of work and other special plant and equipment is being installed and brought into operation as quickly as possible. The motor cycle part of the business re- maining at 31st August has been disposed of and transferred to Coventry, where the manufacture of New Imperial motor-cycles will be continued, but in which we have no further concern. STRONG RESERVE POSITION Will you now please turn with me to the report and balance-sheet. The profit and loss account and balance-sheet of the parent company are clear and I do not think there is need for much explanation of the figures which speak for themselves, but I should wish your consideration of the consolidated statement printed below which shows the present nosition of the - - --- - - - - - - -- - - - Ã½ - I - whole group. The aggregate profits shown of Â£96,022 are after providing for depre- ciation-less income-tax-and N.D.C. You will notice that the reserve for income-tax and N.D.C. at Â£70,952 bulks large and in this connection I should ex- plain that your Board have decided to re- serve the income-tax due in 1941 on the profits earned in the year under review, therefore the income-tax reserve covers for two years-this and the previous one. I am sure you will agree this to be a prudent course. N.D.C., of course, corresponds to the profits of the year on which it is payable. Our liquid or floating assets less sundry creditors stand at Â£148,237 and the total of fixed and liquid assets Â£362,307 or rather more than double the share capital of Â£170,000. The conservative policy of the Board, to which I have previously referred, has enabled us to finance entirely out of our own resources the acquisition of the New Imperial works on which you will see we have so far disbursed Â£72,727 and we shall have the cash available to cover the cost of the further equipment required and sundry extensions to the other factories now in hand. THE SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES I am able to report that all the subsi- diaries and the associated company- W. G. James, Ltd., London-have satisfac- tory order books and are working to full capacity. Their well-earned reputation for quality ahd accuracy, and the confidence of their customers are fully maintained. MOTOR COMPONENTS (BIRMING- HAM), LTD.-The Burbidge and Cherry- wood Road factories are very busy and likely to remain so for a considerable time. The new department established for specially high precision work, which I men- tioned last year, has done well and is developing rapidly. CLIFFORD COVERING COMPANY, LTD.-Our hard rubber automobile steer- ing wheels have met with great success and it has been necessary to further increase the plant and buildings at Tyse- ley to give the additional production called for by our old clients and the several other motor manufacturers who have adopted them. VALVES, LTD.-This Coventry sub- sidiary continues its steady, course and judging from the present pressure of work may look forward to further advance. CLIFFORD AERO AND AUTO, LTD.- This new subsidiary, as I have mentioned previously, already has orders on hand which will ensure them operating at full capacity for at least a year, and it can be reasonably expected that they will make a substantial addition next year to our turn- over and revenue as I have said. There are already 220 workpeople employed and the number will, of course, be augmented as new plant is installed. I must mention armaments profit duty. It is to be expected this year that one of our subsidiary companies will come within the limits of its operation. The prevailing taxation is certainly heavy and future calls uncertain, but I feel sure that we are all willing to share the burden which the defence of Home and Empire and the fulfilment of the nation's obligations must inevitably cast upon us, and that nobody will wish to evade their responsibility or benefit unduly by national necessities. TRIBUTE TO MANAGING DIRECTOR, EXECUTIVE AND STAFF Before I close I wish to pay tribute to the untiring energy and capacity of our managing director, Mr. Joseph, who is, further, one of the original founders of the business, which during 25 years' service he has nursed from infancy to what I may term its present lusty adoles- cence, and also to the other executive directors, Mr. Evans and Mr. Murphy. Each and all of them put heart and soul into the business and have demonstrated the old copy-book adage of our school days, \" Success is by industry achieved.\" I also wish publicly to express the appreciation and thanks of the Board and the share- holders to all the others of the subsidiary and associated companies, managers, fore- men and workpeople who pull together as one big team and exhibit an interest in their work worthy of all praise. This esprit de corps is something to be en- couraged, and some measure of the pros- perity of the company to which the workers so greatly contribute automatic- ally benefits them. I am pleased to say that our employees have procured a very fine sports ground within comfortable reach of all the Birmingham factories which will provide them with the opportunity for healthful recreation and social intercourse most helpful in the furtherance of the team spirit, comradeship and mutual good will. A pavilion and dressing rooms will be pro- vided at the cost of the company with a certain grant to help them on the way, but apart from this it is under their own management and will be self-supporting. I now beg to move: \" That the directors' report and accounts be and are hereby adopted, and the recommendations to pay a final dividend of 12% per cent., together with a cash bonus of 10 per cent., all less income-tax, be approved. Mr. S. C. Joseph, in seconding the adap- tion of the reports and accounts, paid war 1 tribute to the assistance and co- operation he had received from all his colleagues. The report and accounts were adopted. A proposition was submitted by Mr. S. C. Joseph and seconded by Mr. W. Lawley that the remuneration of the three non-executive directors be increased by a sum equal to 1 per cent. of the net profits of the company in each year, to be divided as agreed. This was carried unanimously. Mr. V. G. Hassell Medley was unani- mously re-elected a director. The meeting closed with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.",

   "text_content" : "MR. ERIC MILLER'S SPEECH The twenty-eighth ordinary general meeting of the Bajoe Kidoel Rubber and Produce Company, Ltd., was held yester- day at 19, Fenchurch-street, E.C. MR. H. ERIC MILLER (chairman of the company) presided. The Chairman said: Under the prevail- ing conditions I am sure you will not ex- pect me to make any lengthy speech to you to-day, all our minds being centred on matters of far greater importance than the domestic affairs of this company. The business of the meeting is quite simple-namely, the approval of the state- ment of accounts and balance-sheet and the reports of the directors and auditors- to be followed by the declaration of a dividend. When the Board met to decide upon their recommendations they came to the conclusion that, in view of the financial strength of the company, it would be in the national interest, as well as in the interest of shareholders, to distribute rather more by way of dividend than the amount of the credit balance for the year of Â£5,907 14s 2d. Having been most con- servative in our financial policy in years of prosperity, shareholders reap the bene- fit of this in the solid front presented by our balance-sheet. You would observe in the accounts of our local companies that, before arriving at their net profits for the year, substantial appropriations were made to cover sundry items of expenditure which might have been capitalised. The figures of crops harvested and accounted for in the year under review and in the preceding year are fully detailed in our report. HIGHER SELLING PRICE We accounted for much smaller crops of both rubber and coffee; consequently the unit cost of production was increased, but on the other hand the average net selling price for our rubber was somewhat higher. Coffee results were particularly dis- appointing, but this would come as no sur- prise to those of you who have read my speeches in recent years. The lower price, coupled with a certain amount of active propaganda on the part of Brazilian pro- ducers, raised the consumption of coffee in the U.S.A. by nearly 1% million bags, and as there was no aggregate falling off elsewhere, world offtake was correspond- ingly increased. The production capacity is, however, still far in excess of any likely consumption. It is early days yet to attempt to fore- shadow the effect of the war on the con- sumption of rubber, but the International Rubber Regulation Committee should be able to keep this industry on a fairly even keel. REJUVENATION AND REPLANTING Our estates are in good order, under capable management, and will be kept going efficiently at a minimum of expen- diture. We have done a considerable amount of rejuvenation and replanting in recent years, the reports on which are encouraging, and we feel that the Bajoe Kidoel Company will weather comfortably such difficulties as may have to be faced as a result of the state of war now exist- ing. As you know, our estates are situated in the Netherlands East Indies, and although these are under a foreign flag we have always been fairly treated, as one would expect at the hands of a Govern- ment and people who share our own ideas of freedom and decent relationship with neighbours. It is these for which we are fighting, and whoever can discriminate between right and wrong must have faith that we will ultimately prevail. The Chairman concluded by moving the adoption of the report and accounts. Sir George Maxwell, K.B.E., C.M.G., seconded the resolution and it was carried unanimously. The retiring director, Mr. James Stephens, was re-elected and the auditors, Messrs. Ford Rhodes and Ford were re- appointed. The meeting ended with a cordial vote of thanks to the managers and staff in the East and at home.",

   "text_content" : "The question of synthetic rubber as a rival to the crude material is ever present in Mincing Lane. As a serious competitor to the plantation product the artificial commodity is usually ruled out because of its high cost. It has, however, certain qualities which are absent in crude rubber, among which is resistance to oil. Some market interests hold that it may be possible that natural rubber can be modified by some process, presumably a chemical one, by which it will become endowed with the peculiar properties of the synthetic substitutes. Dr. H. P. Stevens, consulting chemist to the Rubber Growers' Association, does not attach much importance to this viewpoint. This is what he says in a recent number of the \"India Rubber Journal\":- \" If I were in control and had the future security of the plantation industry vis-h. vis the synthetic substitute to safeguard, I would not waste time and effort in a vain attempt to endow natural rubber with the properties it has not got, and which it seems unlikely to acquire. I would rather concentrate all my resources on reducing the cost of producing and marketing natural rubber, and in finding and developing new outlets for it. \"There are, I am convinced, consider. able possibilities in both these directions. I have not recently visited the East, but I have followed developments, and I think it is true to say that there has not been made a single radical change in produc- tion methods (latex excepted) since I visited the plantations before the war.\"",

   "text_content" : "MR. F. L. BLOW'S STATEMENT The third ordinary general meeting of Trojan (Holdings), Ltd., was held yester- day at Winchester House, Old Broad- street, E.C. MR. F. L. BLOW, J.P. (the chairman;, who presided, said that shareholders were, of course, aware that the income of the company was derived first from the divi- dend arising out of its investment in the operating company, in which they held the entire capital, and, secondly, from its investment in Beans Industries, Ltd. Dealing with the accounts of the operating company, Trojan, Ltd., owning very fine works at Croydon, from the profits of that company a dividend was allocated each year to the Holdings company, and he wished to correct an apparent misconcep- tion' in some quarters that the profit of Trojan, Ltd., was much about the same in each year. That really related to the Holdings company, in which the amount of dividend for the year was the combined amount received from Beans Industries, Ltd., and Trojan, Ltd. For example, if they looked at the balance-sheet of the operating company they would find that the profit for the past year was Â£41,822, and that compared with Â£24,995 for the previous period of 10 months only, and accordingly they would see that there had been a substantial ad- vance in profit. From that profit of Â£41,000 odd there had been allocated to the Holdings company Â£22,000. Of course, the directors were pursuing a very con- servative policy at the present time in view of the many unusual expenses that were being incurred, including the new factory in course of erection. They felt that it was very essential that they should keep on the straight and narrow line of financial safety. INCREASED OUTPUT He would like to emphasise the fact that the increased profit had not been the result of a larger margin of profit but was due to the fact that they had increased the output considerably. They would note in the balance-sheet of the operating company that stocks and work in progress was Â£69,000, as compared with Â£88,000 in the previous year. That was due to the fact that they had been able to finish work quicker. Generally, he thought he might say that the directors were exceedingly well satis- fied with the progress that the company had made during the year. Their policy, of course, had always been actuated by prevailing conditions, and there had been times during the year when they had put all the pressure they could on the vehicle side of their operations. At other times they had had to meet a demand for carry- ing out more urgent work requiring the whole of the efforts of their technical men and all available labour. From the profit and loss account of the holdings company they would note that to the net figure of Â£20,590 there were certain deductions for directors' fees and administration ex- penses, and adding income-tax refund, transfer fees and the balance brought for- ward, there was available Â£20,291. The Preference dividend, and an interim divi- dend of 3 per cent. on the Ordinary shares had already been paid, and the Board now recommended a final dividend of 7 per cent., making 10 per cent. for the year, a rate which had been paid each year since the establishment of the company. The Chairman concluded by paying a high tribute to Mr. Basil Monk, the managing director, to Mr. F. J. Dykes and to the whole of the staff for their un- remitting services. The report was unanimously adopted.",
