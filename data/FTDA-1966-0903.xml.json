   "text_content" : "From Our Labour Correspondent BLACKPOOL, Sept 2. The decision by miners' leaders here to-day to \" acquiesce \" in the pay freeze nmakes it almost certain that the Trades Union Congress will decide next Wednesday to suppotA the Government's prices and incomes policy. When the Amalgamated Engineering Union's delega- tion to Congress meets here to-morrow Sir William Carron, the president, is expected to insist that the union's 1.lm. votes must be cast in favour of the Government in the economic debate next Wednesday. 'So the 447,000 votes of the National Union of Mine- workers should ensure victoiy for the Government, but the majority may only be narrow if the Electrical Trades Union decides on, Sunday to cast its 294,000 votes against the pay freeze. Although some members of the AEU delegation will demand that the union's vote should go the other way, Sir 'William is likely to say that the issue has already been decided. He will point to the AEU's own motion on. the Congress agenda which pledges \"full support for the Labour Government's national economic plan, including the productivity, prices and incomes policy.\" Wilson's Task Made More Agreeable Mr. Harold Wilson's task. in addressing Congress next Monday will therefore be a more agreeable experience for him than seemed likely when unions opposing the pay freeze were gaining most of the publicity last month. He will know that Britain's second, third and fourth largest unions support him--these organisations being In order of size:' the U te 7iOsOtrong GOeV.dMu W and the The largest union, the Transport and General Workers', with almost 1.5m. votes, will, of course, oppose Mr. Wilson. And one of the most interesting events at Congress next week will be Mr. Frank Cousins' reappearance as leader of the TGWU delegation. Another notable event will be the speech which is to be delivered by Mr. Victor Feather, assistant general secretary of the TUC, in the absence of Mr. George Wood. cook, the general secretary, who is in hospital. Feather to Reply to Cousins Mr, Feather, who stands a good chance of succeeding Mr. Wood* cock as TUC general secretary in four years' time, will reply to Mr. Cousins's speech on Wednes- day on behalf of the General Counoll: The way in which he handles this clash with the TOWU leader will give his audience a fair idea of his ability, Mr. George Brown, Poreign Secretary, to-night sent Mr. Peather a telegram of congratula* tlions on leamins that he had been chosen by thi TUC Generol Council to be its spokesman in the economic debate, The man chiefly responsible for winning over the NUM exoutive to support the Government is Mr. SId Ford, the union's president. He was opposed In the debate by the NUM's Communist general secre- tary, Mr. Will Paynter, but the executive decided by 14 votes to 9 to accept Mr. Ford's advice. The meeting began with Mr. Paynter insisting that the NUM delegation at Congress was under an obligation to oppose the pay freeze because of a resolution passed by the union's annual don- ference in July. This resolution. which was de- bated before the Prime Minister announced the wages standstill. expressed opposition to \"the pro- posed legislation which will make compulsory the early warning system and vetting of all' wage claims.\" Mr. Paynter pointed out that a motion to this effect had been put on the TUC agenda by the NUM, and Mr. Ford agreed with him that the mineworkers were bound to vote in favour of it. But Mr. Ford, ah chairman of the meeting, went on to give a ruling that the executive must also decide how to vote on the pay freeze supe befause this ha not ep ed ML cont of th 'NVM xdcutlve *M iletiged this ruling, but were defeated by 13 votes to 8. Overriding Policy Decision The executive then passed a resolution supporting the TUC General Council's decision to \" acquiesce\" in the ineasures an- nounced by the Prime Minister on July 20. This led the Left- wingers on the executive to com- plain that the union would be voting in two opposite directions next week. But Mr. Ford said afterwards that the overriding policy decision taken by the execu- tive to-day was of support for the General Council and the Govern- ment. As it happens the NUM's motion on the Congress agenda stemmin from the union's conference dece. sion last July will probably not be debated next week. This is because there'are so many motions on the Congress agenda dealing with the Government's prices and incomes policy that most will not be put to ongress Only two or three com- poite motions on this subject are likely to be debated. The great majority of mine- workers avoided the pay freeze by securing a wage Increase of between 4 and S per cent, last June, But about 10,000 weekly-paid industrial staff, mostly foremen, have had their pay rise frozen for six months because the agreement for them was not signed until the wages standstill had been announced."

The pound fell over the day by slightly over -Ac and closed at just below $2.781. There was, however, a pronouqced speculative flurry in gold shares.

This was reflected in London yesterday by an increase of nearly 6d in the Treasury Bill Rate, at Â£6 15s. 0.06d, the highest level since the 1920s. The Treasury has admitted that, in addition to the published U.K. gold loss, \"there was some recourse during the month to Coen tral Bank facilities.\" This means that, as on previous occasions, the official figure gives little clue to the real drain. it is clear that the Government's July package of deflationary mea. sures has not yet reversed the out. flow of teserves from London. It has, however, slowed it down con. siderably. It was authoritatively Indicated that pressure on spot sterling was much lighter than In July, and sell11g 'less than might have been expected. It is also pointed out that, quite apart from the present economic uncertainties, July and August are seasonally raYwourable months for sterltht. .In the face of a very firm official bealed Ulps\" policy no reliable estimate can be made of what has aetually been' happening to the reserve& in the last few months. The August drop Is, however, the sixth successive monthly fall. The total published drop since February amounts to Â£177m., and the re- serves now stand at Â£1,126m. After allowing for Central Bank support the real loss could have been as much as three times the published -flghs. Some further official information on the nature of the recent ptessures on the re- serves will be given in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin due the week after next, although the full story may not appear until later. There are apparently two masons for the continued loss of reserves. One is the persistent shortage of dollars on the Conti- nent, which has been reflected both la further increases in interest and In Continental sales of itling.

The market, of course, is short of stock but there was plenty of investment buying from the public and the institutions, which pushed the index up another 2.7 to 307.2. The real feature .of the day, however, was gold shares where U.S. speculation drove prices up sharply. Whether the present wave of euphoria will persist into the new account will depend, first, on how Wall Street behaves next week and. secondly, on what the Prime Min-. ister says to the TUC at Black- pool. Both rallies and falls have a habit of feeding on themselves but it is hard to see prices rising very much further unless there is good cheer from both these quarters. More interesting is whether the index will break down through the 291.6 it hit on Tuesday morning as the squeeze begins to bite in earnest Much will hinge on the attitude of the iristitllt; n. whh f.._ tÂ» * . in very short supply during this i' week's rally, and may decide that a it is better to pay 10 per cent too 0 much for the right equities than b risk not being able to buy them t4 at all. I; Town & City - The tone of the Town and City E report is unashamedly bullish. t; Although the chairman admits that o economic circumstances are not on his side and that corporation tax E will be no friend, he forecasts both c a.\" satisfactory \" increase in profits tl and. subject to the state of the d standstill, a higher dividend. There f are two main reasons backing up F such optimism. First, Town and p City is barely affected by office. q building controls and, secondly, d the Â£7%Ym. of developments com- si pleted last year cannot have con- o tributed a full year's income. B In fact, assuming effectively un- &i changed minorities (adjusting only p for corporation tax and a 16 per ti centa\"gro4 divlde, it looks as Ri \"Town' ad City needs to puh profits before tax up from Â£1.95m. to Â£1.25m. Half of this Increase d should come from the 1963-66 e development programme, while P there is a further Â£10im. in the y pipeline at the moment, 74 per 5 cent. attributable to Town and a City. If half this is income-pro.- l ducing in 1966-67 and can show a v net 3 per cent. return, the group tl will be just about home and dry. cl However, this is not the end of y the story. During 1966-67 a P further Â£12m. worth is estimated 14 to get under way including ci Â£4iVm. of shops in develop. si ment areas Which look immune to tl any possible restrictions, and the a following year this figure rises to a Â£15m. As before, just under three. o quarters of the profits will go to Ut the company. g It is one thing to know the size a of Town and City's programme h and that most of what Is in hand las been already let. But the more mportant question is what sort of eturn this Â£27%m. will show. The ost of money from the Prudential an hardly be below the going per cent. plus rate, but given & C's strong industrial and com. nercial bias 3 per cent. net still ems a reasonable hope. Moro- ver, now the group has also tarted dealing as a sideline-the 100,000 invested in such properties gntributed Â£25,000 to profits last tar-there is a certain margin for rror. Thus in five years' time earnings ould be up to 29 per cent or so o put the shares at 7s 3d on a orospective 7%Y per cent. yield. and there will be another Â£24m. of developments still to become ncome-producing by then, though ocal authorities and other outside kolders will claim just under half he proceeds. With the share price it a five year \"low\" too much low seems to be being made of the sroblems and low immediate yield f 4.3 per cent. and not enough of he very solid potential. See also Page 10 Bath & Portland After Amalgamated Roadstone's iterim figures, the drop in Bath nd Portland's half-year profits aomes as no real surprise. Profits efore tax are down from Â£305,000 : Â£136,000 and the interim is cut !rom 6 to 4 per cent. There is ittle hope of making up the lost ;round so profits before tax for the fear \"are unlikely to exceed\" 570.000 against Â£721,000, though *hey should bounce back to square ne next year. Like other aggregate producers Bath has been upgrading its :apacity against the day when he clamps come off, thus boosting lepreciation and interest charges. Bath also has difficulties of its own. Ileavy rains in the first half made 'ortland stone particularly hard to juarry, while there have also been he interruptions on the contracting ide. In addition, the restrictions n office building in London and irmingham have removed the tone subsidiary's main market, and rofl8t last year probably around he Â£100.000 mark. Uncovered This loevo the question of the lividend. On a full tax charge arnings would be around 11.2 Ã½er cent. compared with last ear's 13 per cent. dividend. 1o 'the final could go down is well, especially in view of the Board's warning of a more conser. ,ative dividend policy.

   "text_content" : "By Our Conunodtites Staff LONDON Metal Exchange copper prices firmed up towards the end of last week largely because dealers thought it wise to cover their positions before the holiday week-end. Their foresight was fully vindicated. On Saturday, 6,000 miners walked out of the Mufulira, copper mine in Zambia and the strike has since spread to most of the Copperbelt. Latest reports indicate that 35.000 men are idle. The miners are demanding that savings in the mine pnion s fndu totalling Â£6m. shouldbe rfunded before they join the Government's national pension scheme. LME copper prices have of course risen, last night the price of cash wirebars closed at Â£397 10, a ton, Â£13 up on the week. Nevertheless the increase has been tempered by the fact that Zambia still has a copper stockpile of some 30,000 to 40.000 ton. accumulated durina the boycott of the Rhodeslan ra route. With the strike ION of oduesion add ing up to some 2, to a dy it win be a little timne before a gap appears in the pipeline to the consumer. Tin prices have been much steadier this week and have not approached Â£1,200 a ton the price at which the International Tin Agreement buffer stock manager may give support to the market, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The current feeling is that only steadily cheaper offerings of tin from the U.S. national stockpile is likely to drive the LME price down to the Â£1,200 a ton mark. Lid and zinc prices show Uttle change. Oenerally they have tended to move In sympathy with copper. COCOA-Prices have falleo ap thi week. Lat nht the 4eqtract Dri awed at '\"> M w-; tail| of 16Wsd on was y I ediate rea7 both onand U .-alon market spokesman put it \"Specu. lators have finally had enough,the iiarket Is highly demoralised.

This pro ct ad already pushed pp to a speculative plateau from which it Is now descending. The fall is also being accentuated by the credit squeeze; the shortage of money appears to be forcing dealers to liquidate their stocks. Even quite substantial buying by manufao turers for proceasing has so far failed to stop the market tumble. COFFIE-The International Coffee Council decided this week that its members may export up to 46.5m. bags of coffee in the 1966.67 season which begins October 1.

   "text_content" : "Stock markets hays beeQ i. brighter mood this week-the last of the Account-so much so that Tas FINANCIAL TIMueS dus- trial Ordinary share Index shows the substantial rise over the four business days of 13.1 at 307.2. This understates the extent of the rally which has occurred, as wnen business was resumed after the August Bank Holiday, an early fall in the share index took place and from that level the recovery amounts to 15.6. The more resistant behaviour of Wall Street since the Bank Holiday has helped sentiment, particu- larly, of course, in the Inter- nationals, including Oils, but it is strongly doubtful whether Wall Street has been a major factor in the London recovery. Bargain-hunting After the Fall What appears to have happened is that small public and institu- tional buyers taking a long-term view have been attracted into the market by the low level to which prices had fallen. This more than offset the selling, and reversed the downward trend. This in turn encouraged jobbers, who are pre- dominantly short of stock, to mark up prices. The leading equities have responded with particular vigour because of the substantial bear position in them. As on the fall, volume has been quite out of proportion to the gains, and busi- ness has been small. Most equity sections have parti- cipated, and the gains in Nationa- lisation Steels, on speculative buy- ing because of the big \" discounts,\" and Oils, on Wall Street, have been notable. Machine Tool shares have held up well despite the news that home orders of machine tools in the second quarter of the year were 7 per cent. down on the first, with the trend continuing in July and August. The 27 per cent. slump in all hire purchase vehicle contracts entered into in August also had only modest effect, a the Motor and HP flnance groups were already depressed. The tenor of the interim statement of Imperial Chemical Industries, due next Thursday, is likely to be im- portant to the equity market. Rank Organisation's Record Year Thanks to the fast-growing Rank Xerox copying system, Rank Oranisatlon was able to raise its profits after tax in 1965-66 from Â£4.78m. to Â£5.46m., providing a cover for the maintained 21 per cent. dividend of about 1% times with the benefit of investment allowances and about I* times without the allowances. This is not extravagant cover and the Board's statement that the dividend m rite is lowa than they would have a recommended but for the \"freeze \" ti probably has rd t the hugs cash flow (m. aat Â£13m.) -and the expectation t results for nl 1966-67 should show a further imn S provement. The aroup has had a hi record year in sal and profits. P Pretax profits of Rank Xerox P intly owned with Xerox Corpora Y on) were more than doubled at P L14.78m., and the outlook for this O1 company is obviously still excellent. V It will be interesting to hear from c the chairman how the roup's other hiterbsts, notably um industry, television, hotels, etc., are expected to fare, but on balance the chair- man is obviously optimistic. At 25 10%d-dividend yield 4.1 per cent.-Rank \"A\" are probably I discounting the increase in dividend S r-- - - - - - - - \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t vhich should come when the freeze ods, but the full potential of tank Xerox has yet to be realised. Optimism of Dowty Group Chairman Few chairmen are likely to be ible to speak in more confident vein than Sir George Dowty, of Dowty Group, does in his annual statement. Last year the group's profit before tax declined by 17 per cent., mainly because an ibnormal rise in costs contributed to tighter margins. Sir George now lays that, \"after action taken to unprove economy,\" there is every reason to expect a return to the former level of profitability during the current year. Orders on hand are again at an all-timq record. Demand for the company's avia- tion products-pitch propellors, jear boxes, fuel systems, etc.-is te highest for many years '\"and we foresee an increase in the pre- ient level of sales.\" Many of the company's products are fitted to Rolls-Royce and other world- famous aero engines. Sir George claims that pit closures and the critical shortage of labour must lead to further oeHg n in the more irpnt- ble tinesand therefore to a con inuing demand for Dowty mining -roducts. New forms of apppor ve been developed for use o mine face ends and roadways. Sales of hydraulic equipment for industrial purposes increased by 12 per cent. during the year. New products are to be marketed this year by severalof the group's como panies. At 15t I d Dowty yield 6 per cent., and if tber shoufd be a return to 196465 it should be covered about 1% times. Lower Profits from Tate & Lyle Although the Anancial year of *ate aad Lyle does not end until September 30, 4the Board in its interim statement this week has commendably indicated the likely outturn. The group is, of course, suffering from the slump in the world price of raw sugar, and this is the dominant reason for the expected fall in profits after tax attributable to Tate and Lyle from Â£4.10m. to Â£L.50m. Maintenance of the 10 per cent. dividend would cost gross Â£l3.7m., and on this basis it would be short-earned, but the Board is \"reasonably con- fident\" that tax of Â£302,000 deducted from the 2 per cent. interim already paid will not have to be accounted for to the Inland Revenue. As known, Board policy is to continue a steady dividend, and there seems every reason to look for the maintenance of the 10 per cent. rate for the year. The depres- sed level of the world raw sugar price has resulted in lower proFts from the Caribbean and African interests and the same factor may well have been at work in reduc- ing the engineering profits sub- stantially in the first half of the year. Tate and Lyle, now yield- ing 7.5 per cent. at 26s 6d, has the ranking of a high-class equity. and has this s week attracted long- term buyers speculating on a recovery in the world sugar price. Way Back for R. Westgarth These must be painful days for be Board and shareholders of Leaum Westh. The 10s dinary shares ll at 3s 0%d or bout onequarter of balancesheet set value. The net current asset alue is more than twice the share Wice. Last year, the company sade a loss. after deprecition, of 732,000. and passed the dividend. nd, basically, this is the reason or the depressed share price. The company, which is well- nown in partiul ar for its marine liesel ennes, blames the year's ass on, inter alia, steeply rising osts (plus shortage of skilled Â»bour) on work taken of necessity in a fixed price basis-a common omplaint in the shipbuilding in. lustry. The solution is seen an ncrease in output of engines within he present facilities, thus reducing mit costs. If this policy succeeds, he engianemaking subsidiary hould become profitable again. Cutting out the manufacture of *otadng nachinery-turbo.wenea ors-will, it is hoped, enable the lartlepool subsidiary to function rofitably on its heavy engrneering ad repairig business. The com *any clearly has a dficult row to toe, but the chairman anticipates ubstantial progress this year in storing the group's fortunes pro. ided the Government is more sto essful in curbing inflation. Redland's Dividend Problem In 1965-66-to March, 31-Re&d ad Holdlags, the building materials group, earned 0ots iter corporation tax of 24Sm. or its Ordinary capital, on which ross dividends (18w per cent) rould cost Â£231m. The thin cover ad the adverse impact of the Gov. rnment's restraints on the build. ag industry suggest that mainte. ance of the dividend rate this year must be in doubt. Mr. A. F. P. roung, chairman of the company, lot unnaturally finds it difficult to. make forecasts about immediate Mrospects. The profits earned in he U.K. for the first three months if the crrenatyear are wll below he 'excelleni\" rtsults for the orresponding period of last year, ut it does not necessarily follow, ie says, that this proportionate . luction will apply for the fun year. Mr. Young claims there are tcady signs of awareness on the at om the Government that some. bm mustbe done fthe houing 2es of the nation are to be met It any time in the foreseeable ature. The firmness of Redlands his week at 15s-yield 6.2 per ent.-owes something to confi. lence in eventual resumption of he company's excellent growth ecord. Onlooker",

   "text_content" : "Financal Times Reporter Trade Indemnity disclosed yesterday that it had 870 cases of bad debts in August valued at Â£212,450, compared with only 537 cases valued at Â£159,383 in the same month last year. \" The figures have been steadily rising each month this year. The number of Collections have rien 16.6 per cent and values are up 23.9 per cent in the first eight compared with the same period of 1965.\" said Mr. H. B. Dowell, assistant manager. Collections in the first eight months totalled 5,774 (last yeai 4,953) and values Â£1,311,033 (Â£1,057,812). The previous numerical peak was in August, 1962. when 869 collections were valued at Â£98,226 The highest value of bad debts was in January this year when 706 cases took the total to a record Â£214,814, That figure was inflated by one bi| collection worth about Â£70,000, Ih explained. The average collection was arount Â£100 to Â£200 but inflation and risini prices tended to make the averang rise over the years. It was expected that this year would result in a ve high incidence of debts and collec tions. `The effects of the July measure have not yet been felt. It is bounc to have an effect on bad debts. A good deal of July contracts are barelb at the stage where the first payment! are due. \"The incidence of collections Ih high for August and we think it counic keep up at that level throughout tin winter,\" Mr. Dowell said.",

It appeared that no instructions bad been given to safesuard ari. culture.

The three-week Stock Exchange Account ended yesterday with equities adding to the rally which bega n Tuesday and showing what looked to be their best tone of the week. A notable feature was the burst of strength in Gold Mines set off by US. buying via Switzerland; the gold price question is likely to arise at the International Monetary Fund annual meeting later this month. At 59.3, a rise of 1.7, the Gold Mines index enjoyed its biggest rise since January 8, 1965. Buyers and sellers of equities were fairly well matched in the morning and a 0.1 fall in the share index at 10.30 a.m. was followed by a 0.4 rise at noon. In the afternoon, however, prices began . to push ahead, and at 2.45 p.m. the index was 1.7 up and finally 2.7 up at 307.2. Investment buying on public account provided the main drive; most of it was small, but there was the occasional substantial order which, in the current thin state of markets, made jobbers look round for stock. Sellers were inclined to withdraw their limits and stock was in short supply. The gold reserve figures had no notice- able impact on prices. Yesterday's further recovery in the index brought the rally since the mid-morning turn of last Tues- day to 15.6, or about 5.3 per cent Over the Stock Exchange Account, the index has risen 0.2, after'having been 15.4 down. Gains (24 per cent.) in all F.T.-quoted stocks were once again well in excess of falls (6 per cent); on Thursday, gains were 30 per cent. and falls 7 per cent. Markings of 8,.304 (against 8,519 on Thursday and 8,122 a week ago) represented a quiet day's business.

After a cautious start, many Houses found that while both clearing banks and outside banks were calling. fresh business was often available. Experiences varied but by midday some Houses had made fair progress. Rates of 6* per cent. or 6* per cent were bid for day-to-day loans in the earlier part. But as money came on offer rates tended easier, and in the afternoon balances were often taken at down to Si per cent. and the basic Sj per cent., with margnal sums at 5 per cent. Privilege facilities were used only in small part and sometimes not at all, though it did not appear that any substantial sum remained unlent at the close. There was a fair turnover in bills.

The pound opened at a little below $2.78*, and the rates fluctuated about this level throu9g- out the day. News of the fall in the U.K. gold reserves brought little reaction in the market, though the spot pound gained a point or so. to fall back afterwards. Forward rates were on the whole steady, and while the three-month discount widened less than 1A cent to just below I cent, the six-month rate was little changed at 1A cents. It was thought the authorities intervened with small selling of dollars at six months, in support of the spot rate."

   "text_content" : "DESPITE the fears currently being expressed on Wall Stiiret, and elsewhere about the out- look for the U.S. economy the American oil companies are hoping for their best ever year. A recent survey carried out by the Oil and Gas Journal,shows that in the first six months the 25 largest ponpanles increased their profits by an average of 14.3 per cent. over the compar- able period 1.. 1965. There are two main reasons. In the first place sales are significantly higher than the forecasters expected. At the beginning of the year it was widely believed that U.S. demand would not increase by more than 3.5 per cent, but in fact it has gone up by 4.8 per cent. Secondly prices have remained firm. and even increased in some places. Less Satisfactory In Europe and other areas outside the U.S. the situation is less satisfactory. But even so the big international com- panies have done almost as well as the \"domestics.\" Jersey Standard, which owns Esso, increased its earnings by 11.1 per cent. to $561m., Gulf had a 20 per cent improvement to $252m., while Mobil's profits rose by 14.2 per cet. to 1lowever e new b'lod has appeared on the horizon of all those companies with overas interests so a tax diapute with the U.S. Government over the prices which the companies' producing affiliates in the Middle East and Venpuela chargb their marketing sub- sidiaries in the U.S. .Basis of Charge In the producing countries the companles are taxed on the basis of the official posted prices; less a imall discount, although these bear no relation to the open market prices, which are much lower. There is noth- log the companies can do about the open market, but they can attempt to mitigate its effects by charging their own- affiliates higher prices than would be the case in a normal arm's lepgth transaction. Many of them do this and the U.S. In- ternal Revenue Service esti- mates that some companies have been importing oil into the U.S. at 25 to 40 cents above the open market price level. The IRS argues that this is tantamount to transferring tax- able income from the U.S. to a foreign country, and it looks as if the companies may have to face- a back taxes ia1)i: sgoing back to 1959. ABCO Petrol Although few people have heard of ABCO petrol its sign ,was raised this week over a motor centre at Harlow New Town, which all the major com- panies will be 4studying with interest over the next few weeks. The centre. which claims.tobe the first of its kind in the world, carries self service further than ever before in this country. In addition to self-service petrol pumps there are . self-service lubrication and maintenance bays. and self-service' car wash. ing facilities. ABCO is an independent company, but just under 5O per cent. of its shares are owned by Sinclair. one of the largest oil companies in the U.S. The oompany has about 80 sites in the London area, and with Sinclair's financial and man- agerial backing it is just begin- ning a major expansion campaign. Most of its supplies are imported, but it also has agreements with refineries in this country owned by other companies.",

   "text_content" : "The British Railways Board established a lead over ).K. private enterprise shipowners in the \"short-sea\" field this week with the announcement of its order with John Readhead and Sons, of South Shields, for two 4,000-ton \"cellular\" container hips. These ships are the first of their kind to be built in Britaintr and demonstrate how eager British Rail is to develop its U8m. scheme for Parkeston Quay (Harwich) as a modern freight-handling and passenger port. Quick Turn-round Both ships, costing together lI%m., will come into service early in 1968 and will operate a container service between Harwich and Zeebrugge. Each vessel will carry 148 30-feet long containers and by this bulking of cargo into unit loads British Rail expects each ship to be dis char#d and re-loaded in port within five hours. A conven- tional cargo ship of about the same size would take a day, and possibly two, to turn-round in port: by contrast the British Rail container ships will be able to make one round trip between Britain and the Continent each day. The lower transport costs in- herent in this system should en- able cheaper rates to be offered to customers, says British Rail. The service, in fact, will be dqor-tb6door at a through price, with sea transport integrated with rail and road services in Britain and on the Continent. The container-ship, in fact, will be only one lim* in a chain of transport from thseller to the customer.' In Britain the rail service linked with the Harwich- The 7,000 0re. tons paeenger-cacontaeaer ship Sper%, which made her maiden voyage from Hull to Gothenburg in the England Sweden Line service this week. Zeebrugge container-ship ser- vice will be. operated by flat- wagons each capable of carrying two.containers at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour, maintain- ing .a shuttle service between PartCeston Quay and an inland rail terminal to be built at Stratford (London). British Rail expects that large customers-manufacturers. leas- ing 'companies and. forwarding agents-will provide their own vontaiers, but British Rail itself will build 750 containers - which must cost over Â£500,000-as a nucleus for the service and to help smaller customers. Despite the obvious economic advantages of moving cargo in containers, British Rail and other ship operators realise that not all cargo can be handled on this basis and Harwich ob- viously remains willing to ser- vice non-containerised goods. The remainder of the Â£8m. Parkeston Quay project in- cludes the provision of modern passenger and vehicle handling facilities. The Harwich-Hook of Holland passenger run will be operated by two roll-on 'roll-off passenger-vehicle ferries, aug- mented by passenger ships In peak seasons.",

I am sorry to have to report that in pilte of our un. cessing efforts the results for the financial year under review are still at a low level. Accounts The Accounts of British Tar Products Limited for the year ended 31st March 1966 show a Trading Profit of Â£46,726, a reduco tion of some Â£10,500 compared with the previous year. However, owing to the lower chargo for Depreciation and the faut that no Taxation is payable, the Net Profit is some Â£6.400 higher at Â£22,653. The Consolidated Profit, after taking Into account a Loss of Â£6,464 incurred by the Subsidiary Company, is Â£41,119. The Company's liquid position Is strong, the difference between Current Assets (Â£161,304) and Current Liabilities (Â£30.140) being Â£130,464.

We are now in process of puttinj into effect these recommendations which they confidently expect will enable so, both, to Increase our turnover and t' the same time, 'miterially iuq our \"manufactur Ing and se vicing costs. Accord. ingly, the board have decided to centralise the Company's affairs by closing its Sheffield Office and transferring the administrative activities previously conductedo ithere to our Works at Cadishead on the Manchester Ship Canal. We pla also to Introduce new secount. ins and costing methods which should lead to greater efficiency. We are also placing a much greater emphasis on Marketing than has been in the past. To this end it is proposed to make changes in the Executive Organisation which will strengthen the selling offectiveness of the Company.

The expansion In this business reported last year has. however, not been maintained but there is still reason to hone that certain promising out. lets abroad will lead to an Increase In our export of this product. It should, however be noted that our norts have so far been frustrated y reason of prospeoliv buyers being unable to obtain Import liences, a situation which Is doubt. 1l@s the experieneo of others seek' Ing exports to certain countries, The volume of production on our Hydroa ntion Plant has eon* tind to fal short of capacity and in ordr to itille our e nt to bettr advanta our, P v. pIeni a t I quo F o il- adatag to it eaipitny a.nni r ni 1601 1 constInty sk or c Vw 0lird: trmeni of eontainat mara Ifrem various ouros 1hhi plantl In regulat, Usr., As, romO it January lIast ttI nur our on,.

   "text_content" : "Plantation shares were waker again this week. The PT-Actuarles Rubber index lost jut over a point at 99.94 and Teas dropped apoint to a new all-time low of 66.74. The institutions am. still biding their time, while there are at present precious few other buyers around. The selling has been real enough, widespread, and in- discriminate. This suggests the reason for the market's weakness could be the same influence that the general equity market saw last week-some forced selling dictated by the squeeze on liquidity. On this basis it is possible that with the end of the account yesterday the. wprst may be over. Moreover unless the unit trusts are per- manently disillusioned with Planta- tion shares any further drop in prices could tempt them back into the leaders. Other Factors Against this, however, there are a number of- less encouraging factors. First the greater fall in the general equity market has narrowed the yield differential between the two. As long as the FT-Actuaries 500 share index yields over 6 per cent. it is bard to see Rubbers yielding under 14 or Teas under 16 per cent. drawing much support away from the general market. Secondly the in- herent risks in investing in Plantation companies are not getting any smaller. True, Malaya and Singapore have the return to normal relations with Indonesia to look forward to. But the rubber price, the most direct lever on profits, has been letting the side down. From a peak of 20.9d a pound cif in February, it is now 18.9d a pound, and since pro- ducers margins are little more than 6d a pound at the -best of times even maintained profits from rubber could be thin on the ground this year. Corporation tax. moreover, has already made divi- dend rates look unsafe. Indian Problems India, too has its own problems with its internal unrest and pre- carious economic health. The basic trouble here is that while world production of tea must tend to rise (just given the potential in Africa), any real gowth in consumption is proving difficult to find. The most tantalising market is; India itself. After all the relative prosperity of the Pakistan producers has a lot to do with the way internal Pakistan demand is rising, and even a minute rise in per capita consumption in India would make all the difference. But at present this particular relief seems some way off. Where does this leave plantation shares? The key is clearly selec- tivity.. In rubbers this means stick- ing to the oil palm producers where the long-term prospects are reason- ably good. In teas the choice is qully narrow. The latest results show bow misleading last year was the old m o buying quality teas Aum producers, in fact, bhv dbnen quite as badly as was fared. Two weeks ago.Jereuant started the 4a. rmling with a down by twothirds fr I9 . Last week \" 1m 1 Ta'iedldais revealed protE down from Â£29000 to Â£2741000 and the dividend cut from 7% to 5 per cent. just covered by earnings of 5.45 per cent. Yield at 7s, therefore, is 14.3 per cent. At the same time, AMs , Coeuol dated warned that its profits for 1965 will be \"small:' and this week 'another quality producer, Namdsag has added to the gloom. Pre-tax- profits are down 'from Â£230,000 to Â£157,000 giving earn- ings Of 12.7 per cent. and the-divi- dend is cut from 25% 'to 12% per cent. making yield at 10s 6d just 12 per cent. Makmas in the-same agency group, usually reports hand in hand with Namdang, but this year its results are delayed for a few weeks though whether it has done any better is a moot point Low Yields Curiously enough, these Assams are still resolutely holding on to very low yields, by tea standards. One explanation could be that there is not a good market in the shares at the best of times, and the price has not really been tested. Other- wise there would have to be a rea- sonably clear indication that Assam profits are going to jump back this year. It is true there are reasons for steering clear of other Indian producers. Both South India and doars gardens are getting lower prices so far, though overall out- put appears to be up. Secondly, producing lower quality, cheaper tea looks to mean that they cannot hope to emerge unscathed from the devaluation of the Indian rupee in the same way that Assam producers may optimistically hope to. And so far this season Assam has seen bota higher prices and larger crops on average. But this is by no means the clear sign of returning prosperity that the share prices need. So far less than half the amount bs tea has been sold com- pared with last year, and the real stumbling block tends to be the post-Christmas period when prices have shown a tendency to fall off. Two Sections On this basis there are only two sections left in teas worth looking at. Ceylons are.still something.of a speculation, but the remittance situation should now be getting better, crops are ahead of last year and prices so far less than a penny a pound lower. Finally, Pakistans have none of the devaluation prob-. lenis of Indians, and so far at least 1966. promises to continue their unbroken run of good seasons over the last five years.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR MINING EDITOR POTENTIAL BUYERS of South African Goldt waiued this week until the dust of the recent bout of forced selling had cleared. Then, cauitiously they began to take advantage of a situation which had thrown up some attractive yields on shares in an industry quite untouched by U.K. economi troubles. Yesterday's sudden burst of strength marked the start of the annual gold price talk season in front of this month's meetings of the International Monetary Fund. Gold hoarding; the flow that is leaving London for higher prices in Sbuh-east Asia; the chances of a diversion of South African production from London to France and Switzerland; these were among the talking points in a share market already holding the seeds of a recovery. Recovery is very much in the minds of Ventersost holders who have seen their shares fall from last year's high of 30s to only 15s recently. The decline was hastened by the unexpec- tedly sharp cut in the June divi- dend and this week the chair- man, Mr. R. A. Hope, has made a bfave attempt to give share- holders some guidance on future dividend prospects. If all goes well, the outlook is for a gradual improvement in the current Is 8.4d dividend rate over the years to June, 1969. No further prediction can be made because by then Veriterspost will .be operating in the practically untouched southern area of the property. Currently yielding 10.1 per cent at 16s 10%d, the shares may not be over-priced, but it should be remembered that the actual mining life of Venters- post is now down to about a dozen or so years; The hoisting of men and ore being controbed from an onderground winding chamber at Venteroost. The mine is one of the man, members of the GoM Fields r up and this week the parent as outlined the' way in which It is to use the n5.5m. of neo money being raised by the rights issue. About half the sum will go to the Australian activities, notably in repaying money borrowed for building up to 60 per cedt. the stake in Meant Lyetl and for the Mount Goldsworthy iron ore project. The latter needs Â£lm. for the first repayment on its Â£5m. loan. It has been the first of t4e major consortiums to start shipments of ore from the vast Western Australian iron ore field. These have been closely followed by deliveries to Japan from the Hamersley undertak- ing of Rio Thito-Zhie Corpora tion in which, incidentally. America's Kaiser Steel has a 40 per cent. stake and not 60 per cent as was inadvertently stated here last week. Useful Source Gold Fields has also con- firmed that it is to give Austra- lian investors the opportunity to participate in the fortunes of the group's main subsidiary there. Consolidated Gold Fields (Australia) Pty. This will pro- vide another useful source of funds, but no details of the pro- posed share issue for cash have een announced yet. The issue is intended purely for Australians. In any case it could not apply to U.K. inves tors during the current Treasury clamp-down on the outflow of funds. Holders here of Western Minlal, for example, have been barred from subscribing to that Australian company's rights issue. Details will be coming along next 1o1nth of the new set-up planned for the Patido group. At the top'is the Canadian which controlse TI. In turn, the latter controls Con. solldatd Tia SmeHle and ritish Ti lavetment. The idea is to merge CTS with General Tin and make CTS the continuing company. The trouble with the tin smelting business is that over- seas Governments have a ten. dency to get in on the act with their own smelters. Because of this competition CTS has been seeking opportunities to broaden its activities. The merger plan will help this diver. sification because of the result. ant acquisition of control of British Tin via the 50.77 per cent. stake in the latter held by General Tin. British Tin is, in fact, the key to the scheme. The company's name is just a little misleading now that Tin shares represent (on June 30) only 29.5 per cent. by market value of the invest- ment portfolio. Policy has been to place more emphasis on north American holdings and the latter now account for Â£4.3m, out of a total Â£12.6m. invested. The policy means a lower return on money, but the com- pany reckons that this will be justified in the long run. Mean- while, the burden of corpora- tion .tax is a factor in the forecast of a substantial reduc- tion in British Tin's dividend. On this basis, the yield of only 6.2 per cent. on the shares at 16s 3d is not very encouragina. But net assets equal nearly 30s per share and there is a healthy cash position.",

Wil my father aot tax relie ? 3. Will estate duty be payable and it so, Is there a way round this problem? 1. You get relief only in the sense that you deduct tax from any payments under the cove- nant, so that it does not cost you anything from a tax point of view provided you have enough investment income to cover the payments. 2. Yes, he will be able to deduct the mortgage interest from his income for tax pur- poses. 3. Yes if the property passes on the death of your father. We think it is bound to do so, as even if he passes the pro. perty over to you in his lifetime he will still remain in the house for the rest of his life, so that it will be a gift from which he is not totally excluded. We would suggest that there should be a deed of trust under which from the start you both own the house in equal shares; then there will be no duty on your half on your father's death. COPY OF WILL I am having some dilliculty in obtaining a copy of a will, in which I am given a legacy. Can I Isist on getting one ? You certainly have a right to a copy of the will, but of course at your own expense. However, you could only enforce this right through the Courts, which would be prohibitively costly, so that if you really want a copy of the will it would be easier and cheaper to obtain one direct from Somerset House. *a o id bdo t ourse is to sue the sec person-the \" buyer from you the rights and wrongs of the \" dumped\"think the catr on leandst belonging: to you.

No charge Is made for this servce. with his solicitor threatening to sue; this will probably produce either (i) action to remove the car or (ii) a clear statement that you can do what you like with the car. If (i)-well and good. If (ii)-then you can go ahead and have it towed away. But we would not advise you to do anything until this position has been established. HOLDING TITLE I wish to buy a shed from a man who put it up 30 years ago on a piece of lsad, the owner ofwhich was then, and still s, unknown. Can I get a good title to it? Strictly, in order to make a title under the Limitation Act, 1939, by adverse possession, it is necessary to show (i) who was entitled when possession was taken for the first time and (i) that all such persons have had their rights barred by the statute. However, a 30 years posses- sory title is a reasonably good one, even without strict proof of those entitled being forth- coming, and although you will not get an absolutely good title, you should get a reasonable holding title. Such a purchase is always something of a gamble, but the risks here appear slight. VALUATION My house If due to be take. over under a coamplsaor purchase order. Most - accept the counel' valua. flon?

How- ever, I Intend to make out a seven year covenant to my fiancde payable on or about April 20. This will enable her to obtain the full benefit of her personal allowances as a single person for the year 1967/68. I intend to restrict her income In this manner to Â£450 in order for her to be ble to claim small income allowance. Ts will offset my own loss of earned income allowance dring the year. My problem I will my earned Income\" allowance be restricted for the next six ears whea, after we are arried, the covenant becomce ineffective for lncomeab*x .purposes? My own- sofattl to this is ti rwaiete tÂ« covenant after the first ea iwes, min that the IWinand R!*wne would not aski for aelaynmet of tax in rsp0ecto (h6 claim made 7by mv nflde .for 1967/68. preelate your opinZn o'is scheme and ToUt advice oh clauses etc. hieh should be Ipserted in -te Deed of, Covenait and the Deed of Waiver. If the covenatted payments continue to be made after marriage, then notwithstanding the husband and wife are taxed as one, the strict legal position is that earned income relief would be lost, if you were to deduct tax at the standard rate from the payments. Accord- ingly, in our opinion, you should avoid making the covenanted payments after marriage. However there must be no arrangement when the Covenant is made, that payments will cease before the expiration ps the period stated on the face of the Covenant, since if you have the right to cease to make payments after marriage, the Covenant will be ineffective for tax purposes. But it will be in order if you continue to be liable, but simply fail to dis- charge your liability. Alternatively you could express the Covenant that your obligation continue only so long as your intended wife is single. In view of the foregoing we would advise you against having a Deed of Release, releasing you. from your obligations under the covenant after the marriage, for this would invite the contention that the arrange- ment throughout was that the Covenant should cease after the first payment ripfired, if necessary to the Lands Tribunal. We think it is always advisable to have a pro- sessional surveyor acting on your behalf in the negotiations with the District Valuer, and the expenses of the negotiations will be paid by the local authority. DUTY DANGER In the matter of the entire ex. elaton of a husband from beneft from his wife's income for estate duty purposes (Duty Danger, Jane 11) how Is the question of payment of surtax regarded? It would seem that there would not be ay violation of the principle it she Wped her share of the surtax as it would be a tax on Income which he had not received. If there has been no election for separate assessments, for surtax, the liability for surtax is that of the' husband, notwith- standing that the liability may arise in respect of the wife's income. The husband has normally no right to recover the surtax due in respect of his wife's income, from his wife. Accordingly the payment by the wife of part of the surtax bill may involve non- entire exclusion of the husband from income producing assets given by him to his wife. An election for separate assessments for surtax would obviate this risk. RE-REGISTRATION 1. My wife and I have made similar wills leaving our estates as a life Interest to the other. Do shares have to be re-rexstered when one dies la the name of the survivor or In the name of one or names of the two executeor (renambdenmen)? L WIll a comanny accept a copy of probate? If not can further copies be obtained from Probate Office which would he accepted ? 1. The shares should be re-. registered in the name of the executors of the will, who will become trustees of the life in- terest of the other spouse. In order to do this, the executors in general have only to sign a simple form of request to the company. 2. No; there is one original of the probate, and this is sent to each company in turn, and each company will stamp it as having noted the right of the executors either to be registered themselves or to transfer the shares at their option.",

Stock Market un- certainties and depressed prices are not confined to London as the gyrations on Wall Street this week and the downward pointing graphs of other bourses show. But the argu- ment in favour of \"inter- nationalising\" a portfolio is still very viable. The Hudson's Bay Company has virtually the whole of its assets in Canada where retail stores contribute 70 per cent. of profit from turn- over that increased 6.7 per cent last year; fur sales rose by 14 per cent. This is an investment slanted towards those more concerned with capital growth than income. The yield at Three leading greetings card publishers, Wilson Bros., W. N. Sharpe and Fine Art Develop- ments between them' have doubled their pre-tax profits in the past five years. Whether the same rate of growth can be sustained may be debatable, but even the squeeze should not make severe inroads into what should still be a progressive trend. Wilson Bros.' 4.3 per cent. yield is fully justified. Its dis- appointing results for 1964-65 illustrated how moving to new premises can be costly. But recovery has been swift. Its 1965-66 results showed pre-tax profits 21 per cent. higher at Â£306,000 and full benefits from the move have yet to come. But the interesting feature is that the old premises at Chiswell Street, Londonl (in the books at Â£1.97m. after a 1964 revalua- tion) have been sold for Â£3m. The value of my Greef holding has fallen sharply. What do you advise? We advise you to keep your Greef-Chemical holding as the price is now around its lowest of recent years and could well benefit from the pending re- valuation of .the trade invest- ments. These are in the books for Â£3m. on a 1960 valuation. They comprise 1.4m. British The ardel I toh festure are bad o ans nwir gves by The Flscl Times laveWtmit urea to rdeaf lquirim.

Although no application had been made to change the domicile to Canada up to the date of the last meeting this possibility acts as a prop for the share price."

For a company which exclu- sive of the Chiswell Street premises (which produced no income last year) earned over 40 per cent. on its remaining capital employed, surely a 10 per cent. return on the new money is on the cards.

Only Philblack is quoted. As a pointer to what the revaluation will show, if the investment incomie they provide is capitalised at say a 7 per cent. yield the value works out at around Â£3.5m. and gives a net asset value of 7. 3d a share. Consoldated Gold Flelds Â£1 Ordinary have fallen from an equivalent peak of 120s 3d to 104s 9d partly as a result of the weaker trend in the gold market and partly because of therts issue to raise Â£5.5m. These funds are required to finance projects in Australia, Canada and South Africa. It is expected to maintain the dividend next year on the enlarged capital so the 5.3 per cent. yield looks safe. year pre-tax profits rose 8 per cent. to Â£553,000 from turnover that was 7 per cent. higher-a good effort where marg.is are concerned. Nor did the divi. dend spoil its glamorous record. It was hoisted from 130 per ent, to 14%6 per cent. and has now risen for the tenth year running. Moreover, cover is still a wide 2.7 times after corpora- tion tax. This year will see a full contribution from a useful addition to the group last year and there are plenty of resources with which to pursue expansion. The shares at 1Ss on a P/E ratio of 8 look fair value. There is no real reason while Fine Art Development's yield of 6.7 per cent. at 5s 6d should not be more in line with the others. Profits in 1965-66 again moved sharply ahead and but for the general malaise in markets these figures should have had a better response. This would mean that the present price is fully supported by assets. Also the dividend cost is almost covered by the franked investment income, there is no bank overdraft and no outstanding capital commit- ments. The share price has suffered from some bad news and re- ports from, other chemical com- panies but Greeff with its rather special position in the industry looks relatively cheap on a 7.3 per cent yield at 7s 6d.",

Royal Worcester is well diversified and is benefiting from extra capacity at its ceramics subsidiary. A large proportion of its turnover goes overseas and with demand still buoyant further progress, can be looked for. Finances have been strengthened by a deben. ture issue and the shares are a good recovery prospect. Your Views on Casnoas At a six year low the shares of Cussoas Group are possibly a little overdepressed. The group's nine year growth run in profits came to an end last year due to losses from a new addition to the group but else- where things are going well.

Finances are strong and dividend cover good. At 8s 9d yielding 6.3 per cent the shares could be worth picking up. Will my Walken Oils recover? They should do given time. Walkers (Century) Oils has a ten year uninterrupted growth record which for a start reflects a well run business specialising in industrial and general lubri- cants. The outlook for industry in general warrants some im- mediate reservation but the group reckons it can keep up its solid progress. Finances are in good shape and dividend cover twofold after corporation tax. The shares at 7s 6d down firm 10s to yield 4.9 per cent. deserve retention.",

   "text_content" : "BY a rqwoliem09 ALMOST ALONE sauon the western Mediterranean islands Menorca remains untouched. For the moment it cbntinues to live a life of its own, although it is only 40 miles as the gull Ries from Majorca, which long ago decided that large hotels and villa-type holiday camps would help the local economy. It might have been expected than Majorcan tourists would come over to the smaller island for a taste of the simpler life, but this rarely happens. Most of the aircraft at the airport of San Luis arrive direct from Barcelona; many of the visitors are Spaniards taking a few days off from the summer sweat of Madrid; and the only major ship in the harbour when I was there contained some American sailors disgruntled at a lack of bright lights. Fine white beaches Visitors should not expect any great luxury and they will search in vain for night clubs with more than the thinnest layer of sophistication. But in return they will find stretches of beach with fine white sand almost totally deserted. These are the glory of the island and they vary considerably around the coast. Near Port Mahon, the capital, they are beginning to be developed, particularly in the south-east corner of the island. Along the south coast the scenery becomes more rugged and the beaches turn into small bays confined by high cliffs sprinkled with pine trees. Although there are plans for hotels in many of these places, they are still on the drawing board, and except at the height of the season there should not be anyone very much on the beach apart from the proprietor of the traditional roofed stall who serves alcohol and ice cream when there are takers and sleeps when there are not. in the north the coastline is generally unvisited even by the Menorquihis:' the approach is made by dirt road through farms and, apart from a few ardent fishermen, no one seenm preared to make the effort. Port Mahon itself rears up steeply from the harbour. Until recently it contained the only accommodation' suitable for foreign tourists, but there is scarcely much point in coming to an island with beaches of Menorca's quality to stay in town, even if it does have narrow winding streets and a myriad of cafes. A new hotel, wrth swimming pool, has just opened .down the coast at S \" ENORCA , RM0Too IINI 0 10--- --- OS S'Algar called the Residencia w-c harges Â£14 a week full boar.

The cafes, too, have a more eastern style, with drinking mainly done in the open air around the squares under the palm trees. Local dishes Ciudadela seems more fond of its stomach than Mahon. Lobsters and crabs locally caught and grilled over charcoal are highly recommended, and there are a number of cafes in the harbour which have a tradition' of' eooking 'for the fishebene themselves and con- squently set their standards hi They tak some winkling out, biit result is worth the effort.-.-, , Mahon has given its name to mayonnaise, or sauce mahonese, which is attributed to one of the Ducs de Richelieu who when visiting the island declared him- self bored with plain salad and told his cook to do better. Mayonnaise was the result, and on Monorca no vinegar is added to the olive oil and eggs, only fresh lemon juice. One of the best places to try it is the Rocamar Hotel in Mahon, which probably has the best cooking on the island. The greedy will also be glad to know that the island has its own gin distillery. The local brand Lord Nelson, named out of deference to the admiral's brief stay outside Georgetown (now called Villacarlos) with Lady Hamilton, costs about Sd a shot in the smaller cafes and is normally drunk with lemon peel and soda water. There is also a locally distilled liqueur Estomacil, which is recom- mended after too much Lord Nelson. Villas for hire Although the cost of living is cheap enough in Menorca for the U.K. travel allowance to go a long way, those who want plenty; of spending moncy may well prefer to hire a villa. A large riiuiber of these have been constructed by the sea at Cala 'n Porter some 15 kilometres south west of Port Mahon by Gale Developments; the rental charges per week range. from Â£0-Â£20 according to the num- ber of bedrooms\" and can be paid for in sterling before leav- ng the country. Those taking villa holidays can travel out by charter plane from 'Gatwick Airport at a return fare of Â£36. The normal method of travel is by BEA or Iberia Airlines to Barcelona and thence by Spantax to San Luis Airport, cost about Â£41. Travel- lers, though, are advised to check on connections to avoid a boring wait at Barcelona. Although Menorca is a small island, hiring a car is highly recommended and is essential for visiting the smaller beaches; the charge for a Seat 600 is from Â£2 15s a day upwards."

   "text_content" : "Editor of Amateur (Jardemng AT SHOW after show In recent weeks my eyes have been assaulted by the vivid colour of dahlias. massed in bewildering banks of bloom which made analysis and selection impossible.. Anxious to keep myself .up to date I deter- mined to spend a .quiet afternoon during the Bank Holday week-end at a good dahlia narsery and see if there wais, anything really good that I had overlooked at the shows. Some of the answers I have come up with are rather surprisingf. I can find no tangerine dahlia that pleases me so much as Chinese Lantern. now quite an old variety by dahlia standards, nor any light yellow that seems better than Glory of Heemsteds, which is a real old stager. So. of course, is the light pink Gerrie Hoek, one of the sirs dahlias to be likened to a. water lily because of the broad petals and rather open formation of the flowers. It is still a lovely variety and should be in every garden. Elegant Flowers But since Glory of Heemstede was introduced this very attractive water lily shape has been greatly developed and many flowers even more elegant, though with fewer petals, have been produced. What you think of these depends a good deal on what you want dahlias for. If as cut flowers, the lightly built blooms of shell pink Vicky Crutch- field and amber-apricot Waveney Pearl are just the thing, but if dahlias are required solely for garden display the fuller blooms of the conventional \"decorative\" and \" cactus \" types may be more suitable. One very distinctive newcomer in the water-lily class is Flutterby. It has very long stems and the broad yellow petals are lightly flushed with scarlet. Another new, variety that should be first rate for cutting is Cimarosa. It has ramrod stems and very bright rose pink flowers. Rose , Polly Peachum, looks just as fine a cut flower and sufficiently distinct in colour to be worth buying. Both varieties are on my list. So is Madrigal which I think is the orange dahlia I have been look- ing for. It is a good clear dolour, has neat flowers and produces plenty of them. It is said to make good sturdy tubers, too, which means that it should be relatively easy to store in winter. I wish dahlia growers would give a little more information about this important point for it is one quality that cannot be assessed by looking at the growing plant Only when it is lifted in the autumn does one find out just how good-or poor-those vital tubers are. I am torn between two excellent white decorative dablis, Roanie Olivier and Tinker's White. The first has' the water lily type of flower and holds them1 well no above'the leaves' which are rather. a pale areen. Taker's White- hit fuller flowers and darker foUIa which come farther up the stei, giving the imptession of a mdch more leafy plant. Both are lovely dahlias but I fancy that Tiker's White may have the tougher con- stitution. * For years I have grown Newby for its neat ball shaped, salmon. apricot flowers but I think at last it must be replaced by what seems to be an even bettir variety in the same style. This is called New- church and it is very like NeWby but has better stems for cutting. The very attractive orangepink Katisa is also on my list, a well as Mandy, a brilliant little dahlia which, roduces an abundance of scarlet fowers. In the paler shades I still like Angela Yates which is amber tipped with white, the very old Mary Richards, white tipped with lilac, and Lady Tweedssmur which is lavender throughout. The last is extremely like Lady Crdssfeld which is just a shade more lilac in colour. One would not need both in the garden and it is just a ques- tion of whether one prefers the slightly warmer shade of Lady Crosseld or the colder colour of lady Tweedsmuir. White and Lilae A dahlia that has done very well for me is Candy Floss with almost globular white and lilac flowers. Another very attractive ball dahlia is Globular which is white so heavily flushed with red- dish-purple that from a short dis- tance the effect is of an all-purple flower.. Framboosje may be a rather difficult name to remember and worse to pronounce but it is worth remembering for it belongs to a very distinctive raspberry-red ball dahlia. The colour .seems lo fade rather quickly but*stita best this is a very attractive dahlia. Another vpd io with a Dutch naMe is K Taarhee hisbiathe. spiky cactus type of Sfower and is a really deep bright yellow, Oaveiza shades deeper than Hoek's Yel- low which is more of a primrose. Autumn Lyric is a beautiful newcomer to this' spiky-fowered class. It is a neat, well-rfoned flower subtly blending apricot, yel- low and salmon. I like it very much. And here again I am torn, be tween two \" cactus\" whites, Tu-tu and White Rays. Tu-tu has larger flowers but both are well within the size that is acceptable for gar- den and cutting. I have chosen Tu-tu but the nurseryman's pick is White Rays. He may well be right."

The fact is, however, that such a racy- looking, inexpensive car as the Austin Healey Sprite does have a particular appeal to the younger generation, with their undeniable urge to \" aet on with it\" -and overtake anything in front at all costs. - But there are also numerous mature sports car enthusiasts whose regard for the Donald Healey reputation ensures their loyalty to the marque bearing his name. From a road tet recently of the latest (Mark III) model, I believe the Sprite will retain their allegiance. Restyled body This, thi smaller of the two- model Austin Healey range, originally appeared as a some- what spartan two-seater, but with restyling of the body have come improved creature com-. forts. These include the pro- vision -of winding windows, locks to the doors and an ex- terior lid to the luggage boot -formerly one had to burrow behind the seats to reach its interior. Yet, despite these amenities, the Sprite remains very much what a sports car used to be, rather than developing into the madern style GT coupd. Its hard ride has not been sacrificed and it corners very reliably, with almost no body roll and following accurately the desired line of travel, Suspension remains on under- - seung semielliptic springs at the back, with a- onepiece axle. Steering is by rack and pinion, and i s - light as one would expt on so mall a -car the e ient brakPiingi by ldscs at the front and ,dr tpe the back. - The engine is a bOfti-up version of-the \"A\" series' unit fitted in several BMC .rdduc- tions. With .twin carbUitters and other modifications, it will propel the Slprite at frac- tionally over 90 m.p.h., while 60 m.p.h. can be reached in 15 seconds. This brisk performance is accompanied by reasonable fuel consumption-one can ex- pect to average 30 or more miles per gallon. Motorway cruising at a just-legal 70 m.p.h., well within the Sprite's ability, can usually be accomplished without dropping below this li1ure. IAdmittedly,he engine makes ts presence heard whrn revving bard, and the exhaust .note is none too hushed: on the test ear the intermediate gears set up a whine in addition. The short and handy gearlever saicked from one ratio to another very neatly, but- the driver still has to double-declutch to get into bottom. A lively, model More rearward travel on the seats would be appreciated by tall persons, and a slightly smaller steering wheel would give short drivens better for- ward visibility without detract- ing from the Sprite's excellent controlability. Behind the seats is a small upholstered.compart- mient which is decidedly for carrying luggage aid not passen- ger, even a child. All-weathqr equipment seamed wets and wind-pEaof, and frly easy to assemble single-handed' ever its two-piece frame. When stowed in the boot, where the spare wheel also resides, none too much room is left for baggage. But one has to bear in mind that this is a sinmall, cheap and lively sports model; and not expect all that and touring car amenities,; too. Wheel grip Motorists who were bogged down ducing the Bank 'Holiday deluge must hope that. ooner rather than later 4-wheel drive will become much more readily., available on cars of medium price.

The title means splinter, sliver, as well-as glitter, brightness, refulgence, gaudiness, and also rumour, uproar, crash, sudden burst.

The piece lasts about ten minutes. The web of sound is attractive in timbre. The general 'feel' of each episode comes across, if not the logic or. sense' of the music. It is a work hard to imagine with- out the compose-conductor him- self in command, holding'the reins of. nine inter-acting freedoms.

With Miss Burton it is all determina- tion and timing. Perhaps by now that delicat frail frame has filled out a little to help her withstand the buffetings of opponents and the elements whose force last year in a gale literally blew the tiny creature of her feet. Before she can have another crack at Miss Congdon, Miss Burton must again beat Diane Brider (Devon), who held matchpont against her last year. Miss Molesworth's likely semi-final oponent is Binnie Orchard, the strong, hard-hitting Surrey girl who scored a rare win against Miss Congdon in the Nestle tournament last year. Despite the fact that junior form is notoriously unpredictable it will be a major surprise if Uoyd and Miss Congdon do not retain their titles. To me the chief interest will be in seeing what promise there is among the others for the future and to judge how this year's standard compares with that of previous years."

   "text_content" : "by DAVID PALMER At 10 o'clock this morning, the serene calm of the Solent will be shatterad by 47 giant power boat setting ofT on their annual 198-mile shindig from Cowes to Torquay, and the sixth Daily. Express Power Boat Race will be under way. The field is remarkably open for the Beaverbrook Trophy and Â£1,000 prize for the first boat home, Sbnp-uTom Atl~ and has: to some extent. been depleted by accident. during the earlier part of the season. Last y*ar's winner, Dick Bertram's Brave Moppie, sank during the U.S. Sam Griffiths Memorial Race in. February, in which two out of 31 entries finished, and damage estimated 4t Sim. was done to boats. Sir Max Aitken's Merry Go-Round, which captured the world diesel record from Brave Moppie in March .of this year with an average speed of over 60 tn.p.h., will also not be starting, having been dropped on to a quay after the Miami-Nassau race in April. But the U.K. entry is neverthe- less strong. Don Shead's Levi- designed Delta 28, with twin Daytona engines producing 1,200 -I' - h.p., has already proved its relia- bility by winning the Wills Inter- national in June and the Senior Service Trophy in July, the latter at an average speed of ovet 50n m.p.h. The Gardner brothers' Surfury, which was right up in the hunt until a minor engine failure in last year's race, is back aainp with increased poweor(l,0 b.h.p.) and these two boats reprem sent the spearhead of the U.K. challenge. An unknown quantity is the brand-new Flying Fish, de- signed by her owner, Peter Du Cane. With 1,350 h.p. she is the most powerful boat in the race. An older Du Cane design, the bulky Tramontana I could upset the odds if it blows hard, while considerable interest has been aroused by the all-British News of the World, designed by Colin Moodie and Antony Seedel, built by W. A. Souter of Cowes, and powered by four Poden diesels. But the favourite for the race is the 1,000 h.p. American boat Ghost Rider, owned by Hugh Doyle and driven by the very ex- penenced Jim Wynne. Wynne has still to win a Cowes-Torquay race, and, his success in the. Miami- Nassau race in April, when most of the U.K. entries had to retire, gives him a head's psychological start over his rivals. Merrick Lewis, second in last year's race in Thunderbird, has elected to drive his new 1,000 h.p. Thunder- bolt, and can be expected to be near the front The other main overseas chal- lenge comes from Italy, led by Sonny Levi in his own designed, 1,200 h.p. Delta Synthesis"

Dishes of the World-Bond Land The Gas Council has created recipes of James Bond's favourite dishes and is feeding them to Food Fair visitors at Olympia. The project is called \" Food For Love.\" I asked the Gas Council if they meant the dihes had aphrodislao qualtiesbut they said onl!' \"tat they couldn't be responsible for any that might have nor the con- sequences.\" On the whole, they felt Bond probably did pretty well without help from food or wine. In fact, most of the Bond recipes are simple for those who want the lot-scrambled eggs and bacon be- ing a typical example. But here is the sort of thing one expects from this hero. CRAB AND CREOLE RICE 1 crab 1 pinch saffron 1 tablespoon chopped pimento 2 small onions finely chopped 4 tomatoes cut up Y0 teaspoon pounded ginger 1 pinch of thyme 1 clove of garlic, pounded 4 oz butter % pint water. Remove the crabmeat from the shell, keeping it in fairly large pieces. Melt one oz of butter, add all the ingredients except the crab- meat, saffron and pimento, and toss well in the butter with- out browning. Add about 1/3rd pint of water and leave this mix- ture to simmer gently for about an hour. Pass it through a fine sieve or timmy, pressing it to obtain a thick sauce. Melt the second ounce of butter in a cas- serole, add one teaspoon saffron, one pimento cut' into small pieces and the crabmeat, lightly brown, then pour the sauce over them and cook the whole for about 5 minutes. Serve hot with Creole Rice (cooked rice with chopped green and red peppers and sweet corn added)."

   "text_content" : "SHARB PRICES in New York have been falling steadily since last February and the fall has accelerated during the past few weeks. In London the break began only in mid-June but has been much steeper: by last week- end both markets were rather more than 20 per cent below their peaks. Then, on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average suddenly dropped by another 13.5 points, its sharpest fall in a single day since the famous Black Monday of May, 1962. Prices in London were marked down on the Tuesday morning, but both markets then began to rally strongly, a movement which continued until yesterday, when Wall Street lost some ground. iaterest rates There was no obvious reason for Wall Street's sharp drop at the beginning of the week. A good deal of publicity was given, of course, to Mr. Truman's warning that tight money and high interest rates might eventually lead to a serious depression, but this only deepened anxieties that already existed. Despite the continued buoyancy of the economy and the fact that the greater risk at present appears to be inflation rather than recession, U.S. in- vestors arC plainly not happy about the Administration's policies and the business out- look. Foreign affairs, particu- larly the war in Vietnam and the strains within NATO, may be one source of dissatisfaction. The continuance of the balapce of payments deficit may be another. But it is the squeeze on credit and the steady rise in interest rates that has most up- set the investing public. Not that the squeeze has been particularly fierce-certainly not so fierce as hard-money men have been recommending as a cure for inflationary price rises. Loans have become harder to obtain because the authorities are no longer prepared to satisfy fully the enormous demand for credit. But interest rates have risen to levels not seen for many years ,past; this has not only created difficulties for certain sectors of the economy-savings associations, for example, have been unable to keep up in the race for deposits and a shortage of mortgage finance has caused a sharp drop in housebuilding- but has stirred uneasy memories of the past. The prejudice against dear money in the United States is deep and wide- spread. President Johnson, in particular, was once opposed to high interest rates and only a few months ago was quarrelling with the Federal Reserve Board on this point. His present readi. ness to acquiesce in the upward drift of rates has perturbed people of many shades of political opinion. Tax outlook The credit squeeze cannot be discussed in isolation from the case for a further tax increase. The President has been waver- ing on this Issue since the begin- ning of the year. hinting first one thng; and tein anothetr Byi early summer it was the general belief that he had decided to shelve a decision until after the Congressional elections in November but might well in- crease company taxation-per- haps through a reduction in de- preciation allowances to curb the investment boom-early in 1967. This, however, would levefseve#rl crucial months dur- ing which inflationary forces nIu&,r, w P.ad -and might retult in the, ji itlon of a Ibke oudslatjt just the wr=ng point of the business cycle rise in nterest rates, therSfore aart from its imme- diate impact on share prices, has come to be rewarded as a sym- bol of the Administration's failure to regulate the behaviour of the economy in the way that Americans have gradually come to regard as normal add a standing reminder of the possi- bility that uncontrolled expan- sion may tumble over into severe recession. The firmer tone of Wall Street in the middle of the week was due not only to a feeling that the fall in prices had gone too far for the moment but to a vague expectation that the Administration may soon an- nounce further economic mea- sures of one soft or another: a tax increase that had the effect of bringing down interest rates might well reassurn investors and strengthen the market. But until the President's intentions are clearer, investors will probably continue to live on their nerves and prices may move sharply in either direction. London prospect London, while reflecting Wall Street's uncertainties, has troubles of its own to consider. First, a fall in British company profits is not a future possibility but a short-run certainty. Re- ported profits as a whole are still slightly up on the year, but pro- fits being currently earned have probably fallen already and may soon fall more sharply. Second, the credit squeeze here may soon become much tighter than in America-the banks are already hard up against their lending limits, and the selective employ. mont tax becomes payable at the beginning of next week. The strength of the technical rally which got under way on Tuesday was impressive: the Industrial Ordinary index has bounced back above 300 as easily as it slipped below it last week and is now over 15 points above the worst. But the sharpness of the recovery was due mainly to the fact that there were bears to be squeezed and that a little institutional buying found job. bers short of stock. There is no firm evidence that the market has yet found its feet again, and a further fall cannot be ruled out as the squeeze becomes tighter. It would be surprising, however, if prices were to stay far below their resent level for very long,",

   "text_content" : "Â·~Y JO A Rdo THIS week's figures for hire- i purchase and credit bust. ness in the motor vehicle trade are the first concrete signs in the credit field of the Govern- ment's July moves. The total of all vehicle contracts during August were down 27 per cent. compared with a year ago, with a particularly drastic drop in motor-cycle and scooter business. It is too early to say, of courde, whether the Government's attempt to cut consumer spend- ing by Â£l0n. over the next 18 months through stiffening the HP. terms is on target. One month alone is not enough to go on- and August, according to the motor trade, is a particularly erratic month. Nevertheless there is no mistaking the speed with which this part of the Great Squeeze, at any rate, is taking effect. Cumulative Effect of Restraints What the Government did was to raise the down payment for cars. motor-cycles and caravans from 25 to 40 per' cent, the highest level, as the table shows, since Mr. Butler's 1956 squeeze, and the repayment period was cut from.27 to 24 months. The down payment for domestic appliances (with the exception of cookers and water beaters, which do not come under the controls) was raised from 25 to, 33 per cent., with a six-month cut in the repaymeot period, .Furniture, too, was. subjected to stiffer terms. What adds to the severity of these measures is the camulative effect of 'the restraints imposed by the Government over the last 18 months. In February this year the maximum repayment period was reduced from 31 to two years (27 months for cars) and minimum down payments were raised by 10 per cent. Coming on top of the earlier measures announced in the 1965 Budget, this meads that the doirn payments for cars has doubled and that for a television set or a washing machine has gone up by over three times. So it is not surprising that the new contracts made in the motor vehicle trade last month were at their lowest level for an August since 1957, since in fact HP be- came such a large factor in car sales. Reports that some dealers are doing everything they can to help purchasers find the heavier deposits, even 'at the risk of bend- ing the rules, illustrate the diffi- culties in which the car trade, particularly on the used side, finds itself. For whereas only one in four, or less, buyers of new cars require HP finance, the ratio is the other way round for second hand cars. Not un- naturally i is dealers in this market who at present are find- ing the going most difficult. One problem was that prices were already weakening before the July measures came into force. This was' partly the result o1 the leadingceilingÃ½ imposed o finance houses last year (and re imposed since) which prevent! them from going above the level reached in May, 1965. By th< early months of this year some of them were already over thb mark and by the end of Jung the debt, owing to them totalled Â£863m., against Â£807m. at the beginning of the period. Sc rationing was the order of th< day, and one of the ways in which tite finaice houses did this in the car market was to be much more selective over trade- ins for old cars. They also took a harder look at some of the fringe dealers. Now even the most optimistic dealer would admit that business was slow and a car which might have fetched Â£500 as recently as June will now $o for Â£50 less (varying, of course, according to make). This should have its i effect on the new market since I potential buyers will have to put up more. But so far the new car market as a whole, as opposed to the level of HP con- I tracts, has been holding up sur- , prisingly well. July registrations were only 1 per cent. below the 1 1965 level and although the August figures are not yet avail- able the general feeling is that they too, should only show a smal drop. Full Impact by End of Year Clearly it is early days yet for the weakness in the used car market to work its way through -the predictions for registra- tions in the last few months of the year are still surprisingly cheerful, What is more puzzling is why the HP figures for new cars-well down over the last three months-have not shown up more in the overall sales figures. One possibility is that deliveries to companies, which form a substantial part of total sales, are bolstering the figures, more than usual since private buying is very much slower at this time of year while company buying is far less seasonally affected. Whatever the reason the full effect of the measures should be felt in the new car trade by the end of the year. There is no such delay for the manufacturers of domestic appliances. Their fate for this year is clearly written on the wall already and it is not a happy one. Washing machines have suffered worst, with sales down 17 per cent. in the first six months of this year compared to 1965. Although there are no hard figures for the last six weeks the gloom has deepened. The manufacturers have not been helped by the destocking being done by retail outlets as they prepare for a hard winter. June Disappointing for Refrigerators In the first six months of the year refrigerators were not being hit so badly, with sales,down by only about 4 per cent. But June was a more disappointing month and here, too, the credit restric- tions are feared, although rather fewer are bought on credit than is the case for washing machines (where HP accounts for well over 50 per cent. of sales. At least the worst time will come first if past experience of credit squeezes is anything to go by. The National Institute Economic Review predicts that rather over half the total effect of the latest HP restrictions will take place between August and December. Curiously, the im- mediatq psychblogical reaction to a credit squeeze tends to be broader than the actual measures warrant. And cookers, even though they are not actually in. cluded in the HP restrictions, could well suffer in the short term. As far as the rest of coin- sumer durables are concerned, television manufacturers, after a promising mid-year rise in rentals, have now been sharply *4, hit bythe rise in deposits. In the domestic appliance field there are sparks of hope despite the overall picture. The sialler appliances, food blenders, coffee makers, hair driers and the like, always tend to benefit when the more expean sive durables become difllcult to buy and shoppers lower their sights. On top of this, sales have already been booming over the last 18 months (those of coffee makers, for instance, were up 80 per cent. in 1965) and manu- facturers report that this tread ') is continuing. Even for washing machines and refrigerators the credit squeeze is not likely to affect all parts of the market equally. Here again, past experience sug- gests that the top end of the market tends to come out better than the more popular section. The more expensive machines' are on the whole bought for cash (one maker of dishwashing machines, for instance, reports that less than 20 per,canU of his sales are on credit terms). The washing-machine market any- way is experiencing a tendency for buyers to trade-up, while the lower end of the market, which is by now to a large extent a replacement one, is suffering from a lag in the cycle. Furniture Drop Forecast While the makers of the larger domestic appliances were re- signed to an unexciting year be- fore the July measures came along, the ' furniture industry was quietly enjoying. steady sales. During the first six months deliveries rose by 3 per cent. even though the credit side of the business (roughly 30 per cent. of turnover) had fallen - back. Now the Furniture De- velopment Cpuncil is gloomily forecasting a 15 to.20 per cent. drop in credit sales during the second half of the year. Furni- ture is , usually one. of the markets most sensitive to a credit squeeze, and even the joint promotional campaign which the industry is starting soon (after a similar successful attempt in the spring) will not be enough to deflect the normal f' pattern. As far as the finance houses are nbacerded, ' thd' vehicle market, which, accounts for threequarters of their business, is the crucial one over the next 18 montth. Durab1le have f6r some time been. a. small and declining chunk of their buni- ness, For the rest of this year the will be occupled enough with -cutting their leiding below the credit ceiling again, and in this sense the July measures came as something of a relief. even 'If they were a little more severe than the finance houses required. But by the beginning of next year most houses should have fqnds available for mov- ing elsewhere. Manufacturers looking for medium term finance (particularly in the leas- ing field) could find that the finance houses will step into the joint-stock banks' shboes,.",

   "text_content" : "BY EDMUND PENNING-RQWENtISE ALTHOUGH in Britain we I rather pride ourselves on I our catholic taste in wines compared with other countries- * and our merchants certainly pro- vide us with an incomparable , choice-are we not perhaps too. t much accustomed to using a French and German wines as i our yardsticks and accepting the ' others only if they are cheaper? I believe this is so, and the result 1 is that while we like to think we have the best wines here, I in fact we seldom drink the finer table wines of what may be con- veniently called the lesser pro. ducers. These include Australia, Austria, Hungary, Italy,Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. Growers and merchants in any of these countries will tell one the same story. Gently but firmly the ,picture of the discriminating English connoisseur is trans- formed into a caricature of a carpet-bagging bargain hunter on the run between price-cutting off-licences. Present company excepted, of course. Too Ribky It is the finer wines that are most affected, begause they are i naturally more expensiv and more often than not are bottled at source. Recently I was talk. ing to an Austrian producer of excellent dry white wines. He did sell a little of his wine In cask for bpottling inside the country. Would he ship thus to Britain? No, it was too risky. There was the long journey via the Danube and the Rhine to - dww Hamburg, and thence across the North Sea. On the voyage the delicate white wines might get out of condition. The casks might become ullaged and the wine flat and oxidised before it was bottled. And, he murmured. there were other dangers in shipping an authentic wine not in bottle. One knows, of course, what these dangers are I No doubt it is very flattering to the French in particular to. compare most wines with theirs. They at least have no doubt as to their superiority. as may be seen by their, attitude even to- wards German wines. It takes an exceptional Alsace grower to admit that perhaps some of the really finb Moselles and Rhine wines are the equals of a good Alsace Riesling. And. Common Market notwithstanding, I am given to understand that passing a camel through the eye of a needle is child's play compared with passing a case of German wines through the French Cus- toms, so formidable are the administrative hurdles. The Ger- mans admit the French wines all right, but what' often happens thereafter is another story. It is by no means the rule that the finer beverage wines of these lesser countries are bottled at source, but for the reasons given above they tend to be, particu larly the white wines. There is another reason. The quantitles involved are so small that It would not be worth importing such wines In cask. Wines bottled In the country of origin must be disproportionately ex- pensive because of the extra charges. Bottling costs are often higher abroad, and whereas freight and insurance on wine shipped in cask may work out at about 4id a bottle, it could be as high as Is for wines imported in bottle. The duty on foreign bottled table wines is now 3s 10d -5d more than for cask wines; and for nearly two years now the import surcharge has borne heavily on foreign.bottled wines, as it is based on the total in- voiced price, which will of course include bottling and freight charges. All this tends to make these wines look expen- sive. Even Swiss wines, moder- ately priced for the most part at home, appear distinctly expen- sive by the time they reach English wine lists. Subsidies On the other hand, the Eastern European countries, anxious to sell their wines to the West, appear to subsidise the price. For example, some excellent Slovenian wines bottled at source, may be found here at moderate prices considering the heavy delivery costs they must have to bear. Austrian wines too, may be found very reason. ably priced. Others, however, will be In the 15s to 20s bracket. Are they worth it? I think they are, for they provide a different wine experience in each case. We in Britain do not need to be so provincial as to drink only burgundy or bordeaux, or even only ohiantl. The best Swiss Valais wines, as made by the Wloulloud estate of Diolly, an gg M- -A __li authentic Austrian Gutnpolds- kirchner, or a Hungarian. Dibroi Hdrslevelu, a Rioja of itH' age or a mature DAo Resorva of Portugal-these are wines worth looking at. Particularly when bottled at source they may often provide much more interesting drinking than a great many French or German wines with more familiar names. Not, of course, that one needs to make a fetish of foreign bottling. Indeed there are good arguments in favouring bottling here, although .the Bordelais have been suggesting lately that all appellation controlde claret should be shipped only in bottle; an impractical sugges. tion, it seems to me, unless Bordeaux wants to price itself out of the middle price-range market, and add to the pros- pects of some of the other wines mentioned here. Certainly it is not worth importing in bottle wines like Chianti, Hungarian bulls Blood or the bulk of popular Yugoslav wines, so long as the wines are properly",

From 10 p.m., crews in the cold mill department at the giant Port Talbot stelworks began a reduced production programme which involves operating 17 instead of 21 shifts and means a cut in pay packets of up to Â£5 a week. In a fntnml stomta tf. aftW . In a formal statement, SCOW said that the department had been working slack for some time qnd a hoped-for upturn in the order book, bad not materialised. Motor Supplies The comnt psy supplies about 25 per cent. f Britfsb-mide.sheet steel and is a major supplier to the motor industry. Thp introduction of shorttime working follows a series of con- sultatlons with trade uniois. Most of the men belong to the British Iron and Steel Trades Coftedera- tion and the Transport and General Workers' Union. Mr. Jim Williams, the confedera- tiod's divisional organiser, txplained: \"The men will now be workina 4%shifts a week instead of .5% shifts. The reduction in earnings is something we just could not avoid. The company has not got the work for the' men.\" It is understood that SCOW is hoping that the reduced scale of operation will not last more than three monthai though this depeids very much on the general economic climate., The deeion to cut-back comes at a time when nearly 7,000 opera- tives are already on short-time in the ion 'and steel industry, on averag lotitn 8B hours a week eah,' Norat.BEasst oatroducers are among the steelma wo have reduced shifts. Steel production so far this year has been about 9 per cent. down on the corresponding period a year ago 'and producers are apparently ung oply about four-fifths of aomal capacity. Total steel output this year, if SCOW is an indicator, may, at the bAst go o b ighbi thea 24.5m. tons-some 500,000 tons below the most pessimistic of the f6eeasts made at the tutrn of the year and 2.5m. tons below the record lovel reached In 1965. Disturbing Factor One \"disturbing factor\" in view of this lower tempo of output has been a continuing surge in imports. which in the first seven months of 1965 were up by a third. Within the total imports to date. sheets have risen 59 per cent. to 205.593 tons.. Shipments from the Continent appear to be responsible and a close watch is being main- tained for signs of dumping, par- ticularly in view of the fact that ,thbigher level is dlifcult to recon- cile with the imptort sutcharge (due to be lifted this autumn). A further,disappointment is that exports of. Brtish steel have not been going so well. Up to the end of July, shipments fell 15 per cent. to just over 2m. tons, though sheets alone have gone out in higher quantity (contrasting with the fact that the amount being imported has risen sharply)."

   "text_content" : "By Our Labour Staff The decision by the Ministry of Health-announced yester- day-to authorise pay iacreases back-dated for three months for general practitioners, bhospital doctors and dentists from December 31 does not violate the pay freeze. The increases are worth up to 16 per cent. in the first year with a further 16 per cent. 12 months later. But the protest campaign planned by junior doctors at Southampton hospitals is to go ahead despite the announcement, a spokesman said last night. \" We isked for a pay rise from April I and our campaign will go on,\" he iaid. \"We' are 'also protesting about present conditions 'of the hospital service generally.\" The doctors' move will have the iupport of consultants at the hos- pitals, a spokesman for the con- iultants said later. Asked to comment on a state- ment by the General Practitioners Association that the Ministry was 'lifting die freeze\" in order to \"cut the ground from under the feet of the newly-formed Junior Hospital Doctors Association,\" a Ministry * spokesman said the authorisation was purely a techni- al step which bad been expected. Certainly the Ministry's action seems fully justifed by paragraph 21 of the White Paper on the prices and incomes standstill. The White Paper states that agreements should be deferred for six months from the original opera. tive date. If that date was before luly 20, 1966. then the increases -although still due after six months-should not actually be handed over before the end of the year, According to a Ministry of Health .statement, \"these increases were originally due from April I but, as with other commitments not implemented before the Prime Minister's statement of July 20. the operative date was deferred by six months. The authorisation now given to 'Boards means that hospital doctors and dentists will receive the increases due at the earliest possible date consistent with the general incomes stand- still.\" , Similar instrucions were being given to cover general practi. tioners. the statement added. The New Rates 'nThe new salary scales, tor the main hospital grades, are as fol- lows: House officers-Â£1,100 rising to a maximum of Â£1300; senior house ofcer-Â£1.450 rlising to Â£1,650; registrar-Â£1,650 rising to Â£2,050; senior registrars-Â£1.950 rising to Â£2,550: medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons- EÂ£1850 rising to Â£3,250; and con- suitants-Â£3,200 rising to Â£4,885. Meanwhile, it was announced that the Minister has accepted an invitation from the JHDA to address junior hospital doctors on the future of the hospital service and the long-term prospects for junior staff. The meeting will be on September 15 at Birmnbgham."

Modern Designs What really put ga fire sales in the map. and started the steep upward climb after a long period of doldrums, was the new conception in design 'as epitomised by the \" Debonair ' fire. Flavel's \"furniture piece with the wood surround and the \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t staight, modern lines of electric fires. The success of this, and other gas Ore designs that departed so much from tradition, should have been a healthy lesson to cooker manufacturers. How- ever, as lona as gas cooker sales have held up-and, as our table shows, they have tended to do so-manufacturers have been reluctant to make any changes that the future might necessitate. Gas Boards and the Gas Council personnel have been less convnced that gas cook- ing can keep its end up, and are only too keenly aware that it has been coasting somewhat on its past favouritista and the fact that older generations have liked it and taught their daugh- ters to do the same. Now there The gas men ao the other band, are roughly where they were seven or eight yars ago with little to attract the modern cook in the teeth of electric competition. as long as one excepts the few marked signs of progress such as automated, Dr' set cooking anid barbecue roast- ing, etc., operated by electricity and geared to a few models here and there. Such attempts at sophisticated gas cooking as have aee launched are very much in the expebsive cate- gories and are. on the whole, unnecessarily complicated and ill-designed. The Oas Council, indeed, has obviously given up its longhbeld hopes that manufacturers might think about to-morrow as far as gas cookers are concerned and has, at considerable ex- pense, commissioned izdepen- dent design consultancy othe subject New Materials Aiming at the new buying generation, the object is to ex- plord the potential of new materiale-stainless steel inl stead of the familiar vitreous enamel-design and function. Electric cookers have overcome the old complainte about their functions such as slow heating- up, lack of instant control and the rest Now gas has to meet the en6my on its own ground of cleanliness, modernity, efciency and-considered to be very One c pe of thigs that -re a*in e favour of young mothers towards electric cookers h the fact that dials are placed hith on a splashback panel, out of the reach of children. There are, of course, many other ptos for electricity and cons for gas cooking creeping into conversa- tions with salesmen, and the main idea now is to scrap all the old concepts and to bring about a total reapptaisal In gas cooker design within the limita- tions set by the smallness of the average British kitchen. This, and the fact that cookers are less\" fiexible \" than refrigerators which can, for example, be tall and slim instead of squared up. The design consultancy advice would be on sale to all who seek it But the Gas Council is being forced to set its hopes for a revolution on newcomers to the industry-Hoover, Thorn and the like-as well as On existing manufacturers. So far, there is little sign of such hopes materialising into practice, but the future may hold surprises. Rebels Favoured So far, Thorn has shown little evidence of encouraging pro-. gress at its recently-acquired Glover and Main subsidiary. GEC is leaving Cannon to con- tinue to plough its own in- dividual and inventive furrow but not encouraging initiative In lower-priced models where the main backwardness exists. Radiation, too, is concentrating rather on developing old designs than on rethinking and, although there has been some effort at improved, budget- priced cookers. there has been little real imagination brought to bear on any sector. Thus the future is for those who rebel. And, in so doipg. they will have the support of the Gas Boards which are deterioined to keep ga ~cokinpg on the map.- The example is that of the American attern. where gas has come to dominate in the heating sphere but has lost almost entirely to electricity in the kitchen, In to-day's High Speed world.\" waiting for the boost to sales that might be stimulated by natural cheaper gas. is not enough. Such consumer bene- fits ate probably ten years away. And, in ten years. slumping' sales could well destroy a market almost irreparably."

Britain aims to help developing countries increase their trade despite her balance of payment difficulties, Mr. Sidney Golt, Under-Secretary at the Board of Trade, said here to-day. He told the 55-nation United Nations Trade and Development Board that Britain had to give priority to policies to right the -). alance in her payments account and which helped her exports. \"Never- heless. It remains a major objective to help the developing countries It heir efforts to Increase the volume as their trade.\" he added. Mr Golt, who leads Britain's dele. pation, said British overseas aid had ncreased from Â£81m. in 1957-58 to more than Â£200m. in 1965-66. \"There is clearly a limit to the volume of assistance which my country can afford.\" he declared, adding that what Britain could do after 1967-68 would depend directly on the recovery of its economy.- Reuter.",

   "text_content" : "~b~v BE~I WRIGWLÂ¶, A brisk south-wAterly binglng torrential overnight ran d=ay the start of the third round lath, Carling World Golf C(hamponihi p at Royal Birkdale by three quarten of an hour yesterday and discom- sited the early contenders jut when they.hoped to strike a shrewd blow at the leaders. By the end of the day, Kel Nagle had regained his lead by one shot with a round of 73 and total of 215. What's more, four more of his countrymen are ranged behind him in the first ten-Bruce Devlin. \"A for 217. Peter Thomson, 73 for 218, Barry Cozon, 74 for 219, and Colin Johnston. 74 for 219. But Billy Casper the American Open Champion. is the man who has made the greatest progress, and he is happily aced, breathing down Nagle's neck' the best of the weather at the bac of the field, Nagle was out in 35 but even he showed that he could be affected by sheer weari- ness and finished with four 5's at the last four holes. He drove into a bunker at the 16th and was plugged. At the 17th he badly hooked his sour-wood aimed at the green and at the last hooked his six-iron into more sand. Sad to say, Britain's chances of a famous victory now look ex- tremely remote. Peter Butler had a disastrous 79 and faded into the pack. Bernard Hunt was little better-77 for 221--and Neil Coles is the best placed of our contenders (75 for 218). Early on, as Billy Casper and Argentina's Roberto de Vicenzo. winner of close to 40 open titles. strode purposefully down the third fairway with a birdie and eagle respectively already on their cards, the weather relented, as if in deference to their skill. And nothing encourages these great transatlantic performers like a touch of sun on their backs, even when it is forced to penetrate several lavers of damp cashmere. Casper. with his deceptively casual elegance, and De Vicenzo, with the sheer majesty of his power, duly treated us to a magnificent exhibi- tion of professional golf of the highest quality. Duly Casper greatest progress Casper never looked lIke making any sort of serious blunder and finished in 69 for a total of 216. De Vicenzo's putter bertyade hima just once, at the 17th, where he took 6 to Casper's eagle 3, to hinish with 71 and 218. Both are poised to snap at the heels of the eadenrs to-day. De Vicenzo drew first blood with a 1-iron shot at the 493-yard first hole that pulled up a foot short of it, but missed the green at the short fourth, where Casper made his par three with a superb 2-iron shot. The North Americas drew abead at the sixth, when he wedged close to the hole on thiS aupve plÂ»te*u green, and his rival not. And so it.weat on-rather more like a match than a medal round-- with each man inspiring the other. De Viceno persuaded a 14 foot putt into the bole for his birdie at the 8th. but faulted at the 9th- a hote that has cost him dear here before-by hooking into the willow sqrub and taking five. Pirst round to Casper-34 to 35; *The 11th hole produced another birdie for Casper, who hit another immaculate 2-iron and five foot putt. De Vicenzo took the short 12th, where his rival hit a rgaher hurried 4-iron shot left of the green. The 15th, 536 yards into the teeth of the wind, provided a fascinating contrast in styles. Dc Vicenzo fashioned his birdie with two massive blows with a driver, a 7-iron chip and five-foot putt. Casper, immensely powerful for all his relaxed striking, hit the putting surface with a drive, 3-wood and 9-iron, and rolled in his putt from 35 feet. De Vicenzo drew one shot ahead again at the 16th, where Casper's iron faded into a grecnside bunker, but then the South Ameri- can hit his second bad drive. Another book, two wedge shots to the green and then three tired putts made a poor contrast to Casper's marvellous eagle. He hit his 3-iron at this 510-yard hole like a bullet, as if to emphasise the stupidity of those who only regard him as the world's best putter. Ironically he then proved himself to be just that by holing out from 30 feet."

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN IT IS TO BE hoped that' the weather will be warm and sunny at Sandown this afternoon for the Variety Club's sponsored meeting in aid of children's charities. In any event, the quality of the racing is such that there is certain to be a large attendance, but it will be disappointing if the stars of stage and screen who have promised to appear personally and so lend glamour to the occasion are un- able to divest themselves of their mackintoshes. With upwards of Â£13,000 offered in prize money, competition for all six races will be keen, and, in consequence, winners will be hard 'to find. However, Lord Rosebery's 'Mountain Ash may got backers ofil to a good start in the Variety Club Nursery Handicap (1.45) for though this chesnut colt Is by Abernant, whose stock are not usually noted for stamina, he ran on gamely here over seven furlongs at the last meeting when defeating Bayarin and Queen's Proctor and both of these have won since. Welsh Warrior, a grey colt, also by AbernanL, trained by ex. speedway rider, R. Mason, at 3uilsborough, Northamptonshire, is the probable favourite for the Billy Butlin Selling Plate (2.15), as he is entitled to be on the balance of form. Piggott rides, and the combination may be Just too good for the Irish-trained Gay Cloud. The Michael Sobell Handicap (2.45) is a trappy affair, but perhaps 0. Barling holds the key hre with Placo. Miss Togs, a Urs ful two-year-old last season, ran sufficiently well behind Loose Cover at Brighton the other day to suggest that she will go close for the Truvox Handicap (3.15); and though Costmary with Piggott in the saddle will no doubt be the most popular choice for the Customagic Handicap (3.45), 1 doubt her ability to concede 7 lbs to the Northern filly, Lucaya, and 11 lbs to Fortezza, of whom I just prefer the chance of Fortezza. The smallest field of the day will be in the last race, the Variety Club Stakes (4.15), but what is lacking in quantity is more than compensated by quality. In spite of the presence of older horses. Princelone and Pugnacity the winner is likely to be one of the three-year-olds, Tesco Boy, or the filly, Last Case. I hate to oppose Last Case, but bearing in mind the performance of Tesco Boy when finishing second to Straight Die at Brighton at the beginning of August over a dis- tance that was patently too far for him, and his easy victory over Thursday's winner, Promontory, at York later in the month, he is awarded the vote. At Lanark, Master Barry, who disappointed when well backed for a hatdicap at the last York meet- ing, but who had run extremely well on this course earlier when finishing third to David Jack and Haymaking for the Magnet Cup, may win this historic Silver Bell for S. Hall's Middleham stable which landed this valuable prize last year with Current Speech."

   "text_content" : "By Our Air Correspondent Handley Page, of Radlett, which is now working on a new light general-purpose transport aero- plane, the HP-137 Jetstream, ha% strong hopes that the Government vill make a grant of over Â£lm. owards the aircraft's launching :osts. It also hopes to announce ;ome major export orders soon. At present, the HP-137 Jet- stream-a twin turbo-prop Turbo- neca Astazous) capable of carry- ing up to 18 passengers at 300 m.p.h.-is a private venture by Handley Page. By the time the first aircraft is felivered to the first customer, .arly in 1968, the company expects to have spent Â£5m. on research and development. and on tooling for quantity production. Of this total, research and development alone is expected to amount to around Â£2%m., and it is up to 50 per cent. of this figure that the Government is expected to finance, under the general agree- ment with the aerospace industry Flying in May The HP-137 Jetstream is considered promising. Prototypes are now under construction, and the first is due to fly next May. Order for 20 aircraft have been received already from North America. and further big export orders are expected to be announced soon. By the time the first prototype flies, the company may well have commitments for around 200 Jet- streams. Such Government aid will be a coderable success forthe company. Under Government policy o onfin ing orders for major new aircraft to the two big manufactrlng garoups, Handley Page was without a mamor Government order for some time, until It was recently given the Victor bomber conversion contract. The policy also obliged it to look for new work In the smaller transp port aircraft market, in order to ensure that any new venture would be within Its own financial resources. This is why the company elected to design the HP-137 Jetstream, Currently, the company is planning production of the aircraft at the rate of ten per month, with an. ultimate production of around 500 aircraft envisaged.
