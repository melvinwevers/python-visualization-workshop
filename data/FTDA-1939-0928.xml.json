WEDNESDAY Evening. Owing to the shorter business hours the City had hardly learned of the drastic taxation proposals in Sir John Simon's first war Budget, but, from earlier discussions, the increase in the standard rate of income-tax was larger than expected. In view of the state- ment that the time for issuing loans has not yet arrived, to-morrow's Bank Rate decision will be awaited with consider- able interest. As it was to-day, business was reduced to a minimum because of the doubts exist- ing regarding Bank Rate, and quotations for bills varied according to the views taken. For example, four months paper -a Janua:y maturity-was called 4 per cent. to under in one quarter and 3% per cent. in another. The general rate for three months bank drafts, however, seemed to be 3,',, per cent. There were no sellers of the \"hot\" Treasury bills, but a tenta- tive rate of 213';. per cent. was mentioned V \" if business was to result.\" One or two clearing banks refused to go below 3% per cent. for December maturities, but others endeavoured to get this usance at 3 per cent. with no success. Short-loan conditions continued com- sortable, particularly as the market has few bills to pay for until Saturday. Borrowers were again able to satisfy their W requirements in outside quarters down to 2% per cent. L S DISCOUNT PER CENT. PER CENT.

Leading bullion brokers reported an active day's business following on the Chancellor's statement in the House of Commons yesterday. In the silver market business was on a very small scale, and prices were again unaltered at 23%/d per ounce for cash and forward delivery respectively. Lira Easier Developments in the foreign exchanges were few and far between to-day. Not one of the official rates was altered, the ' U.S. dollar being $4.03, the Canadian dollar $4.45, the Dutch guilder 7.52 and the Belgian belga 23.62%. Among \" free\" market rates that for Italian lire again moved in favour of sterling to 78% to the Â£, while Brazil milreis cheapened to 3%d. Quotations in respect of forward dealings in official currencies were unaltered.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 27th Sept. The Stock Market closed mostly higher in busier trading, with the final tendency cheerful. Net gains ranged from fractions to a point, with losses of equal extent in Industrials. Total turnover reached 2,340,000 shares-630,000 above yesterday. The opening was generally firm and with trading active the \" ticker \" soon fell three minutes behind. Initial advances were spread over a wide front during the morning, virtually all groups participating in the continued upturn under the leader- ship of Utilities, Rails and Steels. Although profit-taking was well absorbed, the market subsequently turned quieter, and at midday gains of fractions to a point were recorded by Utilities, Rails, Rubbers and other Industrials. In the early afternoon particular strength was shown by Utilities and Rails, but with profit-taking proceeding in the recent war favourites price movements were irregular. At this juncture gains in Rails, Utilities and Farm Implements ex- tended to $1 and in Rubbers to $2, but Steels were fractions to $1 down and Minings up to $3 lower. Rails, though lower than previously, were assisted by an estimate that this week's figures of freight car-loadings will show an increase of around 7,000 cars. While the gains in Utilities, Rails and Rubbers were substantially reduced in the later operations, buying support appeared elsewhere in the list, notably among Motors. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing aver- age reacted 0.46 to 153.08, whereas Rails C_ ^\"0 ^21/Al d1^DJ0JrQD^AnnrA~r rose 0.17 to the new 1939 high of 35.90, and Utilities advanced 0.42 to 25.28. Deal- ings comprised 939 stocks, of which 381 improved, 354 declined and 204 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Governments and Railroads kept firm. Turnover in bonds was $20,910,000, against $16,920,000 yesterday. Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was 170.7, against 171.8 yesterday. Illinois Central Railroad has ordered 2,500 freight cars costing $7,000,000. Railroad August net earnings compared with a year ago:- Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe, $1,983,000 (inc., $168,000). Chicago and North Western, $1,132,000 (inc., $582,000). Chicago Rock Island and Pacific, $113,000 (dec., $107,000). Louisville and Nashville, $1,449,000 (inc., $141,000).

   "text_content" : "The past two days' hope of a merci- ful Budget has flattered only to deceive. The Chancellor has brought the needs of war finance home to us with a vengeahce. A good many members waited in their offices to follow Sir John Simon's speech line by line on the news-tape machines. The more they read the more their faces fell. It was, per- haps, fortunate that a tacit under- standing had been reached that all post-Budget dealings should be post- poned until this morning. There are some hard knocks for markets to with- stand, but needs must when the war whip drives. Brighter Rails There was a further brightening of prices in the Home Railway market. Apparently it was hoped that the Budget speech might contain some direct, or indirect, encouragement to stockholders to hope for \" a square deal \" even under war conditions. With very little stock tempted out Southern Preferred was bid up 4 points more to 57. At this price it shows a yield of 8J per cent. On what- ever basis Government decides to remunerate the railways, this stock should surely get its full 5 per cent.- a rate that was forthcoming in even the difficult conditions of last year. Good Yields L.M.S. Four per Cent. First Prefer- ence at yesterday's improved price of 52 still shows a yield of nearly 8 per cent. Berwick (L.N.E.R.) First Guaran- teed at 621 offers a return of Â£6 8s per cent., while the Second Guaranteed at 57 yields fully 7 per cent. On all these stocks the maximum dividend was likewise paid for 1938. American Transfers The new plan (of which advance particulars were published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES) for transferring American stocks to New York by cable was not yet in operation yesterday. Arbitrageurs and jobbers expected to have the details and relative forms this morning to enable them to form a final opinion on the scheme. It was unanimously admitted that the idea was a good one. Indeed the American proposal copies a procedure already practised between the over- seas and London offices of many dominion companies. The only serious criticism I heard was that the half- dozen American banks responsible for the plan.were.-perhaps charging too much for a service involving them in no risk of any kind. On a share quoted at $10 a transfer charge of li per cent. ad valorem cer- tainly seems too high, especially as dealers will apparently also have to pay cable costs, including the trans- mission of a photo of the stock certificate. However, at over $100 (which would cover many of the Wall Street leaders like Steel, Bethlehem, Chrysler, etc.) the transfer charge would fall to J per cent. or less. Plan's Advantages The overwhelming advantages of the plan are that, firstly, war insurance of around 2 per cent. on transatlantic shipments of the securities will be wholly saved and that, secondly, diffi- culties arising out of possible loss of the bonds or securities will be obvi- ated. The first factor should enable at least 1 per cent. better prices to be secured by sellers of American securi- ties in this country. The value of the protection afforded under the second heading will be recognised by people acquainted with the present position. About a year agu it was ruled that new certificates for lost American bonds or shares would in future be issued only against a perpetual indemnity by an insurance company. brI Miarial",

Submarines off the American coast have been reported. In the African local trade, voyages within the Union of South Africa are now subject to a reduction which brings the basic rate from 30s per cent. down to 15s per cent. Moreover, the reduction of 50 per cent. on the cargo rate previously apply- ing to sendings by registered post and to securities is now extended to \" bonds,\" but this is apparently elucidatory, since \"bonds\" and \"securities\" are synonymous in the sense that both are evidence of money invested.",

   "text_content" : "WEDNESDAY Evening. Although taxation uncertaintie: were still restricting Stock Exchangi business, to-day's pre-Budget market: were cheerful. Prices in most sec tions closed at substantial advances British Railway stocks being particu larly good. The closing of short positions b2 jobbers or interests outside the Stocl Exchange certainly contributed to thi improved tendency. Some encourage ment was also derived from yester day's statement by Mr. Churchill it the House of Commons. The House closed so long before thi Chancellor's proposals were known that no attempt was made to maintail a market until the Budget speech ha( been made. Bargains marked in all markets totallei 2,530, against 2,418 yesterday. Gilt-edged stocks were better again t, the extent that dealings were less a matte of negotiation. Local Loans and Consol 4 per cent. could both be sold more readil: at their respective minima of 73% anm 98%. Conversion 4% per cent. at 101Y% wa further above its fixed price of 100%. A notable development was the practica absence of special bargains at high prices Gilt-edged prices Page 4 ARGENTINE BONDS BOUGH1 Argentine bonds were a strong featur< of a quiet Foreign Bond market. Thi same regard for the country's economii part in the war which appears to be stimu lating purchase of Argentine rails was re flected in steady inquiry in the bond mar ket. Argentine 3% per cent. changec hands up to 65 and closed 1 point highe; on the day at 63, while the 4 per cent 1933 issue closed 1 point up at 81 Elsewhere the investor remains shy ol European bonds and the only movementl were occasioned by precautionary mark ing down of prices. Thus Belgian 4 pel cent. 1936 lost a further 2 points to clos4 at 52 as a result of continued fears oi invasion. Foreign Bond prices Page 4 L.M.S. 1923 OVER MINIMUM The Home Rail market was one of thi brightest sections of the Stock Exchange with demand on a broader basis. It wai generally anticipated that some light or the plans for Government compensation t< the railway companies might be forth coming in answer to a question to be askec in the House of Commons to-day. L.M.S 4 per cent. Preference, 1923, could be sohl at 35%, 1% points above the minimun price recently fixed by the jobbers L.N.E.R. 4 per cent Second Guaranteed which yesterday rose above the minimun for the first time, continued their improve, ment to 56%. Sellers were able to obtair 55 as compared with the minimum price oJ 54. -Brum. 4 per cent. Preference alst advanced again and was finally 1 point tc the good at 52. The Ordinary stocks showed more sub. stantial improvements. Southern 5 pei cent. Preferred Ordinary were up to 57, a. compared with the overnight close at 53 and the Deferred Ordinary put on % to 10 In the Foreign Rail list some buying was again centred on Argentine issues B.A.G.S. added % at 9%. Elsewhere Can. pacs were in demand and improved to 6% American Rails were quoted nearer tc parities on the new scheme to avoid Atlantic shipment. Prices on Wall Streel made a further advance with gains ul to $4. Home and Foreign Rail prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS BRIGHTER Prices Improve on Better Sentiment Industrial shares as a whole made a better showing. The marked improvement in the tone of this market was attributed to the encouraging nature of Mr. Churchill's speech and to a more hopeful feeling regarding the new taxation pro- posals, which, of course, were not known during market hours. This change of sentiment found expression in the firmer trend of some of the popular shares, not- ably the taxable groups such as Tobacco and Alcohol issues. Strength also developed in Rayon and Chemical descrip- tions. The upward movement was not accompanied by any particular buying and so far as could be ascertained the actual volume of business passing was small and moreover it gave no indication of any ex- pansion of demand. THE FINANCIAL TIMES Industrial index was 84.6, against 83.5. Quotations were firmer in the BANKING group, where Midland (Â£2 10s part paid) and Barclays \" A \" were each % higher. Further gains of Is and Is 6d took place in Barclays \" B \" and Westminsters, while Union Discounts were up Is 6d to 36s 6d. Martins (part paid) were sold again, realising 6%. A few Colonial issues were better. Not many changes occurred in the INSURANCE group. Royals, Sun Fire, Londons and London and Lancashire im- proved. Prudential \" A\" sagged to 19%. Public interest in ELECTRIC SUPPLY issues remained too limited to affect prices generally, but Metropolitans were lower at 35s 6d, bargains down to 32s 6d being re- ported. Yorkshires were marked up 9d to 29s. Gas Light and Coke weakened 9d to 14s 3d. Leading ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS turned firmer. Associated rose Is to 32s 3d and G.E.C. 9d to 63s. English Electrics rallied to 27s. No definite tendency was shown by the MOTOR group. Austins in one quarter were called '/%. firmer at '%g. Dennis were favoured at 17s and Morris at 24s 3d. On the other hand, Leylands and Rolls-Royces each reacted '/e and Napiers fell 6d to 5s 6d. Imperial Airways attracted at 31s 3d, but other AVIATION issues were quiet. Hawker Siddeleys changed up to Is 9d and Fairey to 14s 9d. In COM- PONENTS, LJunlops were armer at o3s UE and Triplex Glass steady around 25s. Lucas were sold and closed 2s 6d down at 48s 9d. SHIPPING descriptions were inclined to firm up on Mr. Churchill's speech. Furness Withys gained 6d to 22s, while Elder Dempsters, Coast Lines and Cairns were 3d better. Union-Castles were dull ana Lamports 6d lower at 6s 6d. Elsewhere Cable and Wireless changed at 43Y% an the Preference at 77. Vickers were good among STEEL share. and left off 4%d up at 156 4%d. John Browns attracted at 25s on the Firth- Brown interim dividend, the latter remain- ing at 65s. Baldwins, Stantons and United Steels were inquired for. Imperial Chemicals spurted Is 6d to 26s 9d, while Borax Deferred and British Oxygens were firmer, as were Turner and NewallB. A TEXTILES showed improvement, notably Coats, Sewing Cottons and Patons and Baldwins. British Celanese were strong in RAYONS, the First Preference gaining Is and Second Is 3d. Courtaulds closed 9d up at 26s 3d. Among STORES, Woolworths and Marks and Spencer rose '/,e each and Gt. Universals 9d further. Whiteleys were steadier at 6s 6d. During the afternoon ToBAccoS took a turn for the better and Imperials, which at the outset were only 5'/i%., advanced to 5%,. British-Americans closed %, better at 4%a and Godfrey Phillips gained %. to 1%. Distillers were Is 6d to the good at 86s 6d. BREWERIES where changed were firmer, with Ind Coopes 2s 6d higher at 75s. FOODSTUFFS were dull. H.P. Sauce de- clined and Liebigrs were 16% and regis- tered shares 15%. Ranks, Cerebos and Tate and Lyle were firmer. American Industrials were very quiet. During the early afternoon Bethlehem were 118, U.S. Steels 96%, Nickels 50, General Motors 67, Chryslers 110 and North America 27%. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 RUBBERS DULL Another dull session was passed in the Rubber share market. The commodity was inclined to harden during Stock Ex- change hours, but with the terms of the Supplementary Budget not available, buyers held off, except in one or two in- stances. Hongkong were wanted, and hardened from 46s 3d to 47s 6d. A small investment purchase of Emerald raised the quotation 7YAd to 16s 10%d. Bah Lias were also bought for investment and finished Is 3d dearer at 23s 9d. The leading counters were in- clined to ease, Anglo-Dutch losing Is to 24s, while Allied Sumatra left off at 15s 3d, against 15s 6d yesterday. Mount Austin closed 9d cheaper at 10s. In Mincing Lane the shares remained quiet, though some buying orders came to hand. Bukit Mertajam were wanted at Is 10%d, Linggi at Is 8d, Merlimau 2s 3d and New Hayoep 7'Ad. Jong Landor were offered at 14s. Tea shares on the Stock Exchange were firm. Borelli put on %a at 2'/., and Con- solidated Tea and Lands were a good market at 27s, changing hands at 26s 10%d. In Mincing Lane Makum were in request at 14s 9d, Moabund 19s 9d and Dimbula Valley 16s. Rubber and Tea prices Page 4 BETTER TONE IN OILS Oil shares took a turn for the better after a few days' dulness, but, with busi- ness small, improvements were not of much consequence. It was not thought that the oil industry would be directly affected by the Budget, an increase in the petrol tax being considered most improb- able at a time when the Government is likely to be the largest consumer. Shells were the most active stock in the market and a fair turnover enabled them to recover %s of their recent loss at 4%/.. Royal Dutch hardened to 38%, but came on offer on Amsterdam account during the last half-hour of business and finally were 3/ down at 37%. Trinidad Leaseholds regained %. to 4% and Apex Is to 28s. British Controlled Preference were 3d firmer at 4s 6d. Lobitos recovered '. of yesterday's set- back at 1%, while Anglo-Ecuadorians held their ground at 20s. Mexican Eagles were steady at 4s 6d and Canadians ld harder at 8s 3d. A moderate turnover of V.O.C. between 24s and 25s 6d left them.unaltered on balance at 25s. Oil Share Prices Page 4 KAFFIRS FALL FURTHER Continental Selling Again an Adverse Factor Dividend-paying Kaffirs remained under the adverse influence of sales attributed to Continental investors, afraid of stricter registration requirements or actual mobilisation of their foreign holdings by their respective Governments. This did not indicate any broadening of business with the Paris Bourse-virtually brought to a standstill recently. Selling orders generally came direct from holders, often emanating to-day from Swiss and Dutch sources. Although the lowering of prices made some shares easier to place, this did not prevent further sharp declines. Small support from the shops was reported in a few instances. Losses of Y2 were marked in Central Mining Bearer at 13%, Rand Mines at 7 and Crown at 13%. East Geduld at 10% and Geduld at 6% each fell %. Union Corporation gave way % to 5%, and simi- lar declines occurred in Consolidated Main Reef and Modder East. Rand Selec- tion weakened Va2 to '%, following the postponement of the dividend decision until December. Non-producers kept fairly steady. West Witwatersrand dropped % to 2%, but Western Reefs, Western Holdings and Marievale improved on balance. After a dull opening West Africans were inclined to firm up, with the result that Ashanti gained %' to 3%,, while Amal- gamated Banket, Marlu and Bibiani each strengthened 3d. In the Rhodesian group, Cam and Motor lost % to 1%, but Globe were %a better at 1/i. New Zealand issues were unaffected by the fresh taxation measures, which mean that the mines will be allowed to retain about 191s 6d per ounce for gold in New Zealand currency (equal to rather more than 153s sterling) subject, of course, to existing taxation, already substantial. Rhodesian Coppers were lowered at the start, and subsequently showed little movement. Rhokana receded % to 11%, Roan 6d to 17s 3d and Selection Trust 3d to 11s 3d. Of other Coppers, Mount Lyell rose '. to %o.. but Rio Tinto yielded % to 11%. A few Tins sagged in a quiet market. Siamese eased 's and Southern Malayan %a, both to 1%Â¼. Southern Tronoh fell %. to A and Tronoh 'a to \"rA. Among Lead-Zincs, North Broken Hill at 1% were unaffected by the year's preliminary profit figure. Mining share prices Page 4",

   "text_content" : "To-day will show to what extent the more cheerful tendency observable in* yesterday's Stock Exchange markets is justified by the proposals of the Chan- cellor of the Exchequer. The general trend of newspaper suggestion hinted that the Government were going to let us down a little more lightly than might have been expected. On the strength of this, a firmer tone de- veloped in the Consol market and in some of the Industrial departments as well. Three or four of the British Govern- ment stocks became saleable at the minimum figures. There was a demand for Home Rails and for Americans. Among Industrials, the improvement spread to a number of the principal shares. Distillers and the Tobacco favourites advanced. Business ex- panded, as it usually does when prices begin to harden. To-day's markets will provide a number of extremely interesting points. Bank Shares Numbers of investors are asking what is likely to happen to the leading banks in time of war; and, if analogy is anything to go by, the answer is provided in a brochure entitled \"Bank Shares in The Great War,\" prepared by a firm of Stock Exchange dealers and headed \" For private circulation only.\" One outstanding feature of the carefully collated statistics is the consistency of the dividends paid through the war period 1914-18. Barclays, for instance, paid 10 per cent. on their \" A\" shares throughout the time; Lloyds 18s per cent.; the Midland Bank 18 per cent.; National Provincial 16 per cent.; while the Westminster dividend rose from 18 per cent. in 1915, to 20 per cent. for the year ended 1918. 1914-1938 Still more striking is the record of the aggregate figures in the years 1914, 1918 and 1938. They come out as follows:- AGGREGATES OF THE BANKS UNDER REVIEW 000's omitted. Current Year Paid-up dpst. and Carry- ended cap. Reserves other acets. fwds. 1914 ... Â£32,787 Â£23,725 Â£725,843 Â£1,645 1918 ... Â£37,181 Â£30,452 Â£1,305,089 Â£2,291 1938 ... Â£65,626 Â£50,480 Â£1,950,094 Â£2,783 From these it is perfectly patent that the banks did a largely increased business as a result of the Great War. The \" Current, deposit and other ac- counts \" showed an extraordinary rise, implying, of course, that the banks could, and did, lend money profitably and freely. So, it may be inferred, is the case likely to prove during the present war. The Late Edward Catton The funeral takes place to-day of Mr. Edward Catton, a member of the House for 35 years, and partner in the firm of Messrs. Grenfell and Co. Mr. Catton had been with his firm for well over 50 years. He was a glutton for work, arriving at the office at 8 o'clock in the morning. He is survived by a widow and four sons, three of whom-two are in the Services-are in his firm, while the fourth is in Australia. Death followed upon an operation from which he re- covered, but to the later effects of which he succumbed. He will be widely regretted in the House and in the City. Antilntuna",

   "text_content" : "Everyone had realised that the war 'Wad set grave financial problems before the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his capacity as custodian of the nation's finances. He confronted them yesterday, in introducing his second Budget of the year and the first war Budget, with the same spirit of deter- mination which characterises the nation as a whole. Although the severity of his proposals is likely to make the taxpayer gasp, the new burdens will be borne unflinchingly as the contribution of the civilian popu- lation toward the elimination of the ruthless aggression which has brought war once again to a scarcely recovered Europe. The magnitude of the Chan- cellor's task can only be assessed approximately, but this can be done quite briefly. In July Parliament had authorised expenditure for the current year totalling Â£1,453,000,000, of which Â£502,000.000 was to be covered by bor- rowing. The war may raise that out- lay perhaps to Â£2,000,000,000, and the question for solution was the extent to which the gap is to be filled by taxa- tion. Short as has been the time for consideration, Sir John Simon has en- deavoured to plan well ahead-the Government, as has been already announced, is making preparations on the basis of a war lasting at least three years-and not merely for the remainder of the financial year. He has set up standards accordingly, standards which are not immutable, but of which it may be said that, broadly speaking, they give the tax- payers concerned a good idea of the worst they will be called upon to bear. Analysis of the details of the new im- posts must await further consideration, but for the most part the Chancellor has not gone far outside the broad trail blazed by his predecessors. In- comes, beer, wine, spirits, tobacco and sugar already bear taxes, the increase of which presents no element of novelty. Death duties are another fruitful source of revenue expected to yield substantially larger sums in future. There can be no shadow of doubt that by these means the Chan- cellor will achieve the very necessary object of curtailing private expendi- ture in order to give the Government free scope for securing the supplies necessary for the campaign. The delayed action of some of his pro- posals accords well with the fact that the present momentum of the indus- trial machine is due in part to civil requirements and in part to military demands, and that the latter are bound to expand greatly as the British forces come fully into action. Thus while the new standard rate of income- tax of 7s 6d in the pound (against the present 5s 6d) and the attendant re- duction of allowances do not come into action until the next financial year, the modified rate of 7s to be col- lected next January will probably be as effective a brake upon spending as would have been the luxury taxes which some commentators had pre- dicted. Industry's hope, of course, lies in the expectation that national expenditure for the time being will replace that of individuals, and it is the virtual certainty of such a develop- ment which affords justification for the reintroduction of an Excess Profits Duty on the lines of Armaments Profit Duty, but covering the whole range of industry. Even when the country has been subjected to the \" unprecedented burden which nothing but the sternest necessity could justify,\" the Chan- cellor will not have provided the whole of the necessary sinews of war. Resort inevitably must be had to loans- though now is not the time-and they will be graded to suit all types of in- vestors. By reliance primarily upon taxation, however, giving time for the war expenditure to augment the national reservoir of savings, there will be a greater possibility of avoid- ing something of the inflation which characterised the war of 1914-18. That will be a very important gain, for it will restrain the advance in prices which was so marked a feature of earlier experience and which con- tributed to the subsequent collapse. It is impossible at this stage to esti- mate with any accuracy the bearing which this may have upon the pros- pect of capital accretions. Provision for a levy upon wealth gained during the war-Sir John Simon's chief new departure-will meet a certain poli- tical demand, while the postponement of definite action until after the war will give an opportunity for ensuring that when the levy is made it will be applied on an equitable basis. Every effort is thus being made to secure that the individual shall make his due contribution to the national need. It is no less essential that the nation shall not be profligate at the expense of the individual, and the public will look to the Chancellor to see that his demands for economy are made no less effective than his calls upon the tax- payer.",

The sum of Â£4,276,400 to be capitalised and issued as bonus shares in the propor- tion of two new shares for every five units of stock is well covered by the reserve fund of Â£5,200,000. The pro- posed creation of 5,000,000 shares of Â£1 to bring the authorised capital up to Â£20,000,000 is of interest, as this will be the first issue of importance to make its appearance since Treasury control was imposed at the beginning of the war. It is well recognised that the object of the issue is to bring the capital more into line with the value of the assets. Since the formation of the company in 1877 to acquire six Scottish distilleries the group has acquired an average of a distillery a year. Its activities outside the whisky business have expanded pro- portionately, and it now produces a range of products varying from yeast to industrial alcohol and plastics.",

There was hardly a quarter in which the odds were not being laid on a change downwards to-day, the view being that the present condition of stalemate must be removed. The fact that the Chancellor inti- mated in his Budget speech that the time for loans has not yet come pro- vides no excuse, in the view of many, for maintenance of the present mini- mum of 4 per cent. As it was, Lom- bard Street found itself in difficulty yesterday, as the rate for short-dated paper had fallen to levels which made sales of bills extremely profitable if Bank Rate does not change. The belief that a reduction in the official minimum would mean still lower rates and larger profits made sellers hold back. Consequently, busi- ness was almost non-existent and the banks asked for bills in vain. Exchange Concessions The decision of the authorities to quote forward exchange rates and to transact forward operations where these can be proved to be of a strictly commercial character was welcomed everywhere yesterday. It was con- tended, however, that this step towards normal conditions could have been carried a little further with advantage so as to include swaps. Complaints are being heard at the manner in which dollar accounts of important institutions are being cut down.

An idea of the changed circumstances was laid before shareholders by the Chairman, Mr. H. N. Lewis, at yester- day's meeting. The contrast is rendered all the more striking by the fact that the company improved its trading profit last year despite recurrent crises and the obstacle of increased costs and ex- penses. Had conditions remained normal the outlook was promising, as produc- tion had been sold ahead for a long period and at reasonable prices. Now, it is impossible to foretell the effect of the war on the trade and busi- ness of the country, quite apart from that of the company. Its main com- modities, such as silk, cotton and wool are already under Government control. In addition, it has to bear extra charges for materials, higher exchange rates and freight costs, marine war risks, and other expenses incidental to the war situation. In the circumstances, a revision of prices has been inevitable."

At Â£26,100 the net profits are nearly double those of the previous year, when Â£13,700 was earned. Profits have doubtless been helped by the recovery in the price of jute, while the Waterford factory has probably contributed its quota of earnings this time.

It appears from the speech of Sir Charles Sykes at yesterday's meeting that the larger turnover is due to some extent to Government orders for war materials, which the company is still carrying out. Owing to the urgency of those re- quirements the company's supply for the civilian trade is limited, but it is evident from the Chairman's remarks that every effort is being made to keep customers supplied as far as possible. Any forecast of future results is pre- cluded by the fact that the business is dependent on conditions beyond its control, but the substantial liquid assets held are indicative of the generally satisfactory finances with which the company faces war conditions.

The arrangement announced last July between Barrow Haematite Steel Company and Colvilles, of Glasgow, by which, as part of an exchange of products manu- factured by each company, the Barrow concern was to cease operating its heavy and merchant mills for a period of 10 years from 1st January next, has been suspended for the duration of the war. According to the arrangement, the Barrow Company was to retain and con- tinue to operate its mines, blast furnaces and hoop and bar mills. A thousand men at Barrow would have been rendered idle by the stoppage of work in the steel departments. All plant is now fully em- ployed. News that there is to be no curtailment of operations has given much satisfaction.",

(b) Brazil Trac- tions and San Paulo Coffee Institute bonds should be registered. No interest has been paid on the latter since July, 1937. A Shareholder-There is not suficient market in the shares to call for daily quotation. Any business in them will be found recorded in our columns. Blarney-West Wits., but more as a specula- tion than an investment. The other share is to be preferred under the latter heading. C. P. F., Hove-In view of the encouraging outlook for South American undertakings, we think the shares named may be regarded as a hopeful purchase to lock away for a time. Diadem-Dealings in the securities referred to are subject to minimum prices. It is possible that your broker could negotiate sales for 4ou. Dominion-The prices given are as cabled, and we have no reason to doubt their accuracy. As the shares are not interchangeable be- tween the two markets, prices are quite independent and are probably more or less nominal. In any case, anomalies must be expected under present conditions. F. F. S.-We know of no such publication, and think you may take it that nothing of the kind is available. John-Such a holding is not affected by the Treasury order, which only refers to securi- ties. Litchfleld-1. Better remain as you are. 2. We see no object in buying these. Pronto-We would hold Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7. No. 4 might be exchanged for a tin company better equipped to take advantage of in. creased production allowances, such as Squthern Kinta. You might make a partial exchange from No. 5 into Ariston or Bibiani. Rhodesia Broken Hill produced 946 tons of zinc and 64 tons of fused vanadium last month. Current costs and profits are not published. The initial aim of the expansion programme is to produce some 30,000 tons of lead and 25,000 tons of zinc concentrates per annum. The big plant is not yet under construction, and its installation may be delayed by the war. R. A. C.-Roan Antelope have promise as a lock-up. Stockholder-We think there is a reasonable prospect of both shares recovering in time and do not advise you to sell at present prices. T. T. B.-1. Better hold in hope of recovery later on. 2. Both are good investments and should be retained. There is no hurry to buy more. 3. These should be'held, but we would wait awhile before buying more. 4. We would hold Venterspost. Production is due almost immediately. 5. We would hold all these. W. L.-Nothing fresh has transpired, and at present there would appear to be no pros- pect of an early resumption of interest pay- ments. There is nothing for it but to hold and hope for the best. X.-1. Think it would be fairly safe to keep your Rubber shares. We know nothing of the suggestion of Government price fixing. 2. We would hold L.M.S. Four per Cent. Preference and Imperial Tobaccos.",

   "text_content" : "Heavy taxation, including a sharp increase in the standard rate of income-tax from 5s 6d to 7s 6d, an excess profits tax of 60 per cent., higher surtax and estate duty and additional duties on tobacco, beer, spirits and sugar are imposed in the first war Budget. The Chancellor of the Exchequer declared that it would be necessary to supplement taxation by National Defence loans on a large scale, but the time had not yet come for their issue. He estimated the new proposals to bring in Â£107,000,000 this year and Â£226,600,000 next year. The changes are: - Income - tax standard rate raised Is 6d to 7s for 1939-40 and 2s to 7s 6d for 1940-41. Surtax increased to run from Is 3d at Â£2,000 to 9s 6d on income over Â£30,000 to come into force in January. Additional 10 per cent. duty on estates over Â£10,000 and not ex- ceeding Â£50,000; extra 10 per cent. on existing 10 per cent. sur- charge on estates over Â£50,000 in force from to-day. Maximum rate on biggest estates 60 per cent. Excess profits tax of 60 per cent. on profits of trades and businesses to replace A.P.D. N.D.C. to remain but only as alternative to new E.P.T. Tobacco duty raised 2s to 13s 6d per pound, equivalent to lid per ounce, operative to-day. Beer duty raised Id per pint, and spirits 10s per proof gallon as from to-day. Tax on light wines increased 2s per gallon and on heavy wines 4s per gallon operative from to-day. Sugar tax increased from 14s to 23s 4d per cwt, equivalent to Id per pound as from yesterday. Levy on war-time increases of wealth to be made after end of war. The changes in income-tax are estimated to yield Â£70,000,000 in the present year and Â£146,000,000 in a full year. The higher surtax rates are expected to bring in Â£5,000,000 this year and Â£8,000,000 next year. Existing allowances for tax purposes are to be reduced and to come into operation next year, with one exception. The exception is that instead of the first Â£135 of taxable income being charged at Is 8d in the Â£ it will for 1939-40 be 2s. 4d. For the year 1940-41 the reduced rate will be 3s 9d in the Â£, but the zone in which this reduced rate applies is extended from the first Â£135 of taxable income to the first Â£165. The exemption limit is reduced from Â£125 to Â£120. The allowance in respect of earned income is reduced from one-fifth with a maximum of Â£300 to one-sixth with a maximum of Â£250. The marriage allowance in respect of 1940-41 is lowered from Â£180 to Â£170 and the allowance for children from Â£60 to Â£50 for each child. CONCESSION ON DROP IN INCOME Special provision is made to mitigate the severity of the increased tax for anyone whose earned income dropped substantially in the present year. Where a fall of 20 per cent. arises directly out of circum- stances connected with the war, the taxpayer can substitute this year's actual income instead of last year's as the basis for assessment. FURTHER Â£6,000,000 FROM DEATH DUTIES The increased estate duty is expected to produce Â£500,000 this year and Â£6,000,000 in a full year. The higher beer duty is estimated to raise Â£11,000,000 this year and Â£27,000,000 in 1940-41, the additional tax on spirits Â£2,000,000 in 1939-40 and Â£3,500,000 in 1940-41, while from the tax on light wines Â£1,000,000 is expected this year and Â£2,000,000 in a full year. Estimated revenue from the additional duty on tobacco is put at Â£8,000,000 this year and double this amount in a full year, while revenue from the increased sugar duty is put at Â£8,500,000 for 1939-40 and Â£18,000,000 in a full twelvemonth.

   "text_content" : "The Chancellor's proposals came as a shock to the City, although they were announced too late to have any effect on the course of business. The increase to 7s 6d in the standard rate of income-tax was the most surprising of the items of additional taxation. Expectations that new taxation would prove to be less drastic than originally feared was reflected in the atmosphere of the Stock Exchange yesterday. Prices for some leading Industrials rose substantially and gilt-edged securities had a steadier appearance. Although the City realised the necessity for raising a large proportion of war ex- penditure by taxation, the severity of the Emergency Budget can hardly fail to affect Stock& Exchange values when busi- ness opens to-day. Members interviewed by THE FINANCIAL TIMEs last night ex- pressed the view that it may take a few days for markets to settle down to the new conditions created by the tax changes.",

It was agreed he was compelled to make wide-scale provision to prosecute the war to victory. Opinion was, perhaps, a little divided on the scope of certain aspects of the in- creased taxation. Sir Herbert Williams M.P., confessed that the proposals had come as a shock. \"I take the view,\" 'he said, \"that we ought to avoid an excess profits duty by avoiding the making of excess profts. It ought not to be beyond the wit of man to solve that.\" Sir Patrick Hannon, M.P. president of the National Union of Manufacturers, said: \" I feel that in the field of industry there will be satisfaction that the Chan- cellor is prepared to proceed by way of taxation rather than o borrowing onl.\".' pu~~urr~rrru*,.~n+tdi~-it~;rg~&~a~i~iÂ·Y",

   "text_content" : "By our POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WESTMINSTER, Wednesday. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, opening his first war Budget to-day, told the House of Commons that the country was facing a total outlay in the present financial year of Â£2,000,000,000. Revenue was not likely to exceed Â£890,000,000 as against the original estimate from existing taxa- tion of Â£942,000,000. It was upon that basis, he said, that his present proposals were based. The Exchequer would need money on a huge scale, and although taxation would make the biggest possible con- tribution it would be essential to supplement such revenue by big Defence Loans. LOANS ON BIG SCALE Proceeding, Sir John said the Exchequer would need money on an unprecedented scale, and in that vast need over the whole period of the war, however long it lasted, taxation would have to make its maximum contribution. On the other hand, it was obviously impossible that the whole of expenditure could be provided out of taxa- tion. \"It will be necessary,\" he added, \"to supplement that provision by recourse to National Defence Loans on a large scale.\" They had to remember in all the efforts to be made on the financial side of this war that, except in so far as war was financed either out of the proceeds of taxation or from the proceeds of loans which came from the genuine savings of the nation, it could only be financed by methods or out of sources which were essentially inflation. That was a course which they must strive by all means in their power to avoid. \" As regards borrowing,\" he continued, \" the time has not yet come for the issue of the new National Loan, but I wish to make a brief statement of a general kind about it. \" When that time does come it will be found that various types of loans will be offered appropriate for great institutions, for institutions of whatever size, and others appropriate for individuals of whatever means, small or great; and here and now I would wish most earnestly to appeal to all citizens and institutions in the country to refrain from unnecessary capital ex- penditure, to put by whatever savings they can make with a view to devoting them, when the new loans are issued, to the prosecution of the war for the benefit both of the nation and of themselves.\" WAR-TIME PROFITS Turning to excess profits in war-time, the Chancellor recalled that the Prime Minister, on 27th April, stated the inten- tion to limit the growth of profits of arma- ment firms. That intention was carried out by the Armaments Profits Duty in the last Finance Bill, but the Prime Minister went on to say that if ever war came: \" We intend that a system shall be introduced to deal with all profits arising out of war and not merely with profits arising out of armaments.\" In fulfilment of that undertaking, sqid Sir John Simon, he was prepared to intro- duce an excess profits tax, which was levelled on the armaments profits duty enacted in the last Finance Bill. In essence, the system devised for armaments profits duty would be applied over the whole field of trade and industry generally, and in consequence there would be no further need to deal with armaments profits separately. The proposed E.P.T. will be a tax of 60 per cent. on the profits of any trades or businesses since 31st March last over their profits for the pre-war standard. The pre-war standard would be arrived at by the use of the same alternative as was adopted in connection with A.P.D. and in the case of new businesses there would be a standard arrived at on similar lines. This taxation was unlikely to bring in any considerable revenue in the current year, both because the machinery of assessment and collections would have to get going, and because in the majority of cases the accounting period for which the tax would be payable will be a period ending at some date hereafter. The National Defence Contribution will remain in operation, but only as an alternative to the Excess Profits Tax, as what was collected from a particular business would in effect be whichever of the two was higher. WAR-WEALTH LEVY The Chancellor dealt with additions to the wealth of individuals during the war and quoted the Prime Minister's statement on 27th April. In this declaration Mr. Chamberlain said: \" It should be remembered that the changes which were induced by war might alter very materially the relative values of property, and that whereas some might be enriched, others might be im- poverished. It was doubtful whether the matter could be dealt with effectively during the progress of the war until the permanent change in value has been established, but he thought it was pos- sible that the subject could best be grappled with by a levy on war-time in- creases of wealth, such as was examined by the Select Committee in 1920, but not at that time proceeded with.\" \" This matter is being further studied in accordance with the Prime Minister's promise,\" said Sir John Simon. \"A levy of this kind could not appropriately or use- fully be attempted during the progress of the war-the Prime Minister indicated as much. \" So far as it may be desired or intended to pay special attention to accumulations of wealth due to the war the necessary comparison cannot be made until the end of the war. Apart from that circumstance, if one looks at it practically, delays in calculation which are very elaborate, rAlanva in asapKsmnntn and dielnva in pnllef- tion are inevitable under war conditions, and would make any project for a levy during war-time impracticable. \" Wartime taxation on income is the practicable and effective method. If Parliament is resolute, as I invite it to be in imposing taxation, that fact will effec- tively tend to . prevent and forestall accumulations of war wealth.\" F.B.I. MEETING The finance committee-of the Federation of British Industries will meet to-morrow to consider the.effect of the new taxation proposals."

   "text_content" : "The fourth annual general meeting of North Eastern Trading Estates, Ltd., was held at the registered office, Team Valley Estate, Gateshead-on-Tyne, on Monday last. COL. K. C. APPLEYARD O.B.E., D.L., J.P., M.I.Mech.E., M.IMin.E., A.I.M.E., the chairman, presided. The Secretary (Mr. R. M. Percival, A.C.A.) having read the notice convening the meeting and the report of the auditors, The Chairman said: Gentlemen,-My very first task in rising to review the work of this company for the year ended March, 1939, is the very pleasant one of recording that during the year Their Majesties the King and Queen honoured us with their presence and were gracious enough to approve the work which had been under- taken and achieved by this company. Their visit will be long remembered and will be at all times a source of inspiration to the company, especially so in these times of stress and change. Under the altered circumstances now existing, compared with those which ruled during the year under review, I feel cer- tain that you will not wish me to make a detailed examination of the figures which have been in your hands for the requisite period. I presume that they may be taken as read. I would like, however, to point out that during the year under review most satisfactory progress was continued, and under the heading \" Estate develop- ment \" is included the cost of 108 buildings complete or under construction, as against 70 buildings in a similar stage the previous year. WORK COMPLETED General and engineering development of the estate is to all intents and purposes complete up to the stage planned for the first 20 years of our work. Any develop- ment now remaining to be done is confined to connecting factories up to our service network. Your company is therefore in possession of a complete estate, equipped for some 20 years with all services, roads and amenities necessary and desirable for the present stage of the new industrial city which has been, and is, springing up at the Team Valley. I am sure it will be a source of great satisfaction to you that it has been possible to complete this work prior to the commencement of hostilities and consequent interruption of so many civil activities. You will also have noted that expendi- ture on administration and on estate ex- penses has increased over the figures for the corresponding period to March. 1938. During the period covered by the accounts which we are now considering your direc- tors were engaged in developing a rapidly- growing undertaking and had spared no effort to provide all those services and amenities so essential for the attraction of new industries. You will, however, be glad to learn that under the altered circum- stances brought about by the outbreak of war it has been possible to make imme- diately very substantial reductions on account of administration, publicity and estate expenses without seriously impair- ing the conditions and amenities for which this company is already becoming noted. FUTURE EARNINGS During the time when the company's activities are temporarily curtailed, it is possible to anticipate an excess of income over expenditure in place of an adverse balance on this account; in fact, if there can be anything fortunate about the present conditions, from the company's point of view it is that of being in the position of having completed the engineer- ing expenditure required at this stage, of having a well-equipped and complete estate and of being able to operate during the war in the confident anticipation that earnings will exceed expenditure. You will have noticed that rents on properties have increased almost five-fold and I am pleased to say they are still mounting; as the future stability of the company depends so largely on this item it may be some satisfaction to you to know that the whole basis of rental charges was examined during the year under review with a view to ensuring that the company should earn sufficient to provide facilities and amenities for tenants at least as good as those obtaining elsewhere and to fulfil our obligations to the Treasury as the estate becomes fully developed. STABILITY ASSURED It is my view that we have now reached a stage ds development where our stability is assured. Had the war overtaken us earlier, I should not have 'been so confident about our position and it is in no small measure due to the energy and enthusiasm of all concerned that we have attained so many of our objects in so short a time. It is gratifying to be able to show that the North East has already reaped some harvest from the bold enterprise at the Team Valley. The economic striucture of the country is being strengthened by the diversity of employment afforded here to some 4,000 people at the moment. Further, it should be remarked that many of'our tenants are manufacturing with British labour articles which were formerly im- ported, while others are producing goods suitable for export. Our capacity for the production of exportable goods may well prove of very great national worth in the immediate future and on the cessation of hostilities.

   "text_content" : "The sixteenth annual general meeting of John Crowther and Sons (Milnebridge), Ltd., was held yesterday at the registered office, Union Mills, Milnsbridge, Hudders- field. SIR CHARLES SYKEs, Bart. (the chair- man), said: Ladies and gentlemen,-The report and accounts having been circu- lated, I assume you will again take them as read. Notwithstanding the fact that conditions in the woollen trade were extremely diffi- cult, mainly owing to the unsettled inter- national situation, I am happy to be able to report that the turnover and profits for the year under review both show an increase in comparison with last year. From the profit and loss account you will see that the net profits, after provid- ing for debenture interest and contin- gencies, amounted to Â£95,619 .5s 5d, com- pared with Â£77,196 7s 4d in the previous year. After charging the Preference dividend, Â£15,000, and setting aside Â£30,000 for income-tax, the balance available for distribution, including Â£50,492 10s 7d brought in from last year, amounts to Â£101,111 16s. The directors propose to transfer Â£20,000 to general reserve and recommend that a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. should again be paid on the Ordinary shares, absorbing with income-tax Â£30,000, leav- ing Â£51,116 16s to be carried forward for next year. Turning now to the balance-sheet, it will be seen that the capital figures are as shown in the last balance-sheet. Debenture stock and interest, and dividends on Five per Cent. Cumulative Preference shares are the same as last year. The increase of sundry trade and other creditors is due to increased requirements for the larger turnover and to larger reserves for taxation; also anticipated ex- penditure for providing air raid shelters for our staff and workpeople. It is satisfactory to note that the excess of liquid assets over current liabilities is maintained at over Â£600,000. The mill buildings, plant and machinery have been efficiently maintained, adequate provision, as usual, has been made for de- preciation, and your directors have expended further sums during the year in the purchase of additional machinery and equipment. The results now before you are due in no small measure to the loyal service rendered by the staff and workpeople. The directors wish me to express their warmest appre- ciation of their services. We have made, and'are now making, various qualities of war materials for the Government. Owing to the urgency of these requirements our supply for the civilian trade is, therefore, limited. We shall continue, however, to make every effort to keep our customers supplied as far as possible. Regarding the outlook for the future. we are absolutely dependent on conditions which are beyond our control. In any case, we can assure you that every effort will be made to maintain our production and try to overcome all the difficulties which may arise. As intimated in the last report, Mr. L. H. Crawshaw, our able mill manager, has been appointed to a seat on the Board, and you will be asked to confirm this appointment to-day. I have pleasure in proposing that \" (a) The report and accounts as submitted be adopted; (b) The dividends paid to 30th June, 1939, on the Five per Cent. Cumu- lative Preference shares be confirmed; .(c) A dividend of 10 per cent., less income- tax, be paid on the Ordinary shares for the year ended 30th June, 1939.\" The- motion was adopted, the retiring directors were re-elected and the auditors reappointed.",

WALTER LINES, the chairman, said: Your company in its 21st year has made progress; its old products are improved, and new designs frequently added. They are sold at competitive prices in all parts of the world where it is appreciated that interchange of trade on reciprocal terms is an important safeguard to peace. We meet so soon after the outbreak of war that the likely effect on our trade is difficult to predict. However, it does seem probable that the embargo on import of toys from abroad will have the effect of confining what demand there is to home products. Difficulties are being experienced due to the control of raw materials. It will be uneconomic and lead to dis- location if the normal well-organised means of supply and distribution of materials is stopped and a fresh organisa- tidn set up. Why not let the Minister of Supply instruct the manufacturers of raw materials to carry on with all their old customers, leaving them no excuse to fail in their supplies to makers of munitions, speculation in materials to be rigorously cut out? It is to be hoped that the British and French Governments have made up their minds as to a peace settlement on the conclusion of hostilities. Whatever exasperation we may feel toward individuals, surely it would be wise to make a settlement based on a Trade Confederation of the four big European countries-Britain, France, Germany and Italy-with power to add to their number. This settlement to be based on absence of any tariffs between them, the only tariffs to be on outsiders. Conditions to be levelled by a universal wage, hour and ex- change agreement. I hope that the results shown will be thought satisfactory. For the present year orders on hand are good, both for export and home trade. Your directors will do their utmost to maintain the company in its strong trade position. Good work has bien done by the staff throughout the year, and we give them the sincere thanks which is their due. The report was adopted.",

JiILirnu vt i V i C MV5U) LJi' The eleventh ordinary general meeting of the Keystone Knitting Mills (1928), Ltd., was held yesterday at Elstree, Hertfordshire. Ma. H. N. LEWIs (chairman and manag- ing director), who presided, said that the gross profit on trading, amounting to Â£45,196, showed an improvement of Â£7,360 on the previous year. Expenses were higher by Â£3,534, which was partly due to the increased cost of all commodities and to the cost of transacting a larger volume of business. The net profit for the year was Â£5,559, as compared with Â£1,462, an improvement of Â£4,097. This improve- ment, in view of the very difficult year through which they had passed, was con- sidered satisfactory. He would have been in the much happier position of announc- ing larger profits for the year had it not been for the increased expenses and losse. due to the two serious interruptions of business caused by the September and March crises. The company's liquid assets at June, 1939, totalled Â£150,194, an increase of Â£11,761, and deducting increased indebted- ness, there was an improvement of over Â£8,000 in the position. PRICE POLICY Had the international crises not re- sulted in war, he would have been able to hold out very good prospects for the coming year. Practically the whole of the company's production for a long time ahead had been sold at quite reasonable prices and there was nothing within the irectors' control which could have spoilt what appeared to be the prospects for an extremely good year. Unfortunately, the country now found itself engaged in a war and at this early stage it was impossible for anyone to foretell its effect on trade and business. The company's main com- modities, silk, cotton and wool, were already under Government control. The increasing extra costs such as higher prices for materials, higher exchange rates and freight costs, Marine War Risks, A.R.P. outlay, compulsory stock insurance, etc., made a cumulativ. total which could not be disregarded and had made it neces- sary for them to revise their prices, but they assured their customers of every helpfulness and consideration in any diffi- culties which might lie ahead of them all. It was their intention to ask only fair prices and to keep their regular friends supplied satisfactorily to the very best of their resources and ability. The directors were all actively engaged in looking after the company's affairs and were giving their day to day attention to the many and difficult problems arising. He had always had the utmost confidence in the ultimate success of the company, and nothing which had occurred had shaken this confidence. The report and accounts were unani- mously adopted, and a shareholder, in moving a vote of thanks to the Chairman and directors, congratulated the Board on the improved results for the year. NEWALL ENGINEERING Newall Engineering Company has de- clared an interim dividend on the \" A \" and \" B \" Ordinary shares of 5 per cent., less tax, for payment on 16th October. This is the first interim distribution since formation in June, 1936. The directors consider that under exist- ing conditions a reasonable proportion of profits should be paid to shareholders -as they accrue, Ahd it is in accordance with this policy that the present dividend is being declared. Issued Ordinary capital is Â£115,000, on which 10 per cent., less tax, was paid for the whole of the previous year. Mr. S. Player is chairman. The 5s \" A \" Ordinary stand around 5s.",
