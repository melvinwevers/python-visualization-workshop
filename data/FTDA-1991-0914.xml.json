   "article_dc_title" : "Major Claims Victory in Battle against Inflation",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson and Ralph Atkins INFLATION is \"licked\", Mr John Major, the prime minis- ter, said yesterday, as the gov- ernment announced that the retail prices index rose by 4.7 per cent in the year to August, its lowest annual rate for three years. Although annual retail price inflation was expected to fall from July's 5.5 per cent by a full percentage point, the gov- ernment claimed victory in the battle against inflation and the markets scented another cut in bank base rates. The Central Statistical Office said inflation's fall was largely because of cuts in mortgage rates, and the fall from the index of last year's petrol price increases which followed the outbreak of the Gulf crisis. Mr Major claimed that the government's \"cautious, pru- dent and sound\" economic strategy was reaping rewards. \"I think we can be confident now that we have got inflation licked in a way we have not seen for many years,\" he said in his Huntingdon constitu- ency. With a record level of house repossessions and mortgage arrears, the property market Is expected to remain dead until the end of the year, dragging estate agents, mortgage lenders, Insurers and construction companies down with It. The main cause for concern, It is argued, Is the high level of loans which are more than 12 months In arrears. Page 5 Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said it was \"excel- lent news\" that the UK infla- tion rate was below the July average of the European Com- munity of 5.3 per cent. \"Over the next few months it is set to fall further to levels compara- ble with the best in Europe,\" he said. The release of the RPI caps a week brimful of economic news. Higher retail sales, lower factory gate prices, a marked slowdown in average earnings growth and the rise in unem- ployment have all sparked ministerial claims that the recession is ending. The week has squeezed acknowledgement from opposi- tion parties that there will be some sort of recovery. As infla- tion has fallen during the year- long recession and the pound has held steady, the govern- ment has been able to reduce interest rates to 10.5 per cent. Yesterday's monthly rise in the RPI of just 0.2 per cent duly quickened market speculation that the government would deliver an interest rate cut in advance of the Tory party con- ference later this month. But the Bank of England sup- pressed expectations by keep- ing the money market very short of funds in an effort to push up lending rates. This week's economic data, however, have not convinced the opposition of the govern- ment's claims that inflation is beaten. Labour argues that when growth resumes, the benefits will be illusory. Mr Neil Kin- nock, party leader, yesterday said the economic squeeze \"has brought a large and relentless rise in unemployment, and a fall in headline inflation which, because it relies on recession, will be neither reli- able nor sustained\". Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokes- man, said that the real infla- tion battle had yet to be won. He pointed out that the under- lying inflation rate, which strips out mortgage interest payments, rose by an annual 6.2 per cent in August. The prospect of a muted recov- ery is being taken seriously by Conservative Central Office. The option of an autumn poll has not been ruled out. How- ever, with more tangible signs of recovery not expected to feed through properly until 1992, it continued this week to play down the prospects of a November election.

   "text_content" : "Bv Richard Donkin in Abu Dhabi and Alan Friedman in Washington CRIMINAL charges are expected to be brought within days by the Abu Dhabi govern- ment against some of the most senior bankers in the Bank of Credit and Commerce Interna- tional. The decision by the emirate, BCCI's majority shareholder, to press charges emerged as eight more of the 22 remaining BCCI executives detained since last Sunday in the Abu Dhabi Police Officers Club were released. The move to charge BCCI top managers may effectively quash efforts by the US Justice Department and the office of Mr Robert Morganthau, the Manhattan district attorney, to have Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the for- mer chief executive officer of BCCI, handed over to them. The US offices made a joint approach to Abu Dhabi on Tuesday through diplomatic channels after hearing of the police action. The charges are expected to emerge when a team of consul- tants and accounts working for the Abu Dhabi government fin- alise an outline of fresh restructuring proposals for the bank. The outline proposal would provide a working draft for a final plan to be announced in time for the December 2 deadline for pro- posals imposed by the High Court in London. Fed rapped for 'abysmal' ecord on probe.......Page 4 None of those released in the early hours of yesterday morn- ing was said to have been closely questioned. All but one of those allowed to go free since the detentions took place are from the second tier of BCCI management or personal assistants to executives. The only senior executive among those held to be released to date is Mr Mazhar Abbas, head of personnel at BCCI. In Washington, it emerged that the committee of central bank supervisors chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is planning to tighten international bank reg- ulation in the wake of the BCCI scandal. Mr Corrigan, who came under sharp criticism yester- day for having moved too slowly on the BCCI affair, said during an appearance before the House of Representatives Banking Committee that BCCI was discussed last week by members of the Basle Supervi- sors Committee. He hoped recommendations on how to tighten international bank supervision would be made by the committees December meeting.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Prows in Washington THE US Federal Reserve yesterday sought to bolster a flagging economic recovery by cutting the discount rate by half a point to 5 per cent, the lowest level since 1973. The move, which had been expected in financial markets, was accompanied by a quarter point cut to 5% per cent in the the federal funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow from each other and the bench- mark for other short-term interest rates. Big commercial banks, led by Morgan Guaranty, the New York bank, cut prime lending rates by half a point to 8 per cent, the lowest since 1987. The reduction in prime rates, the fourth this year, should p=m t a decline in the cost of a wide range of consumer and business loans.

The benchmark long bond, which had risen steeply in anticipation of the rate cut, was down A at 102h in late trading. The Dow Jones Index closed at 2,95.69, down 22.14. Cuts in the discount rate - the rate at which the Fed lends reserves to banks - are infre- quent and occur only when the central bank wants to send a poerful monetary ignal. Tbe discount rate has been lowered in four half-point steps since the recession began last autumn, most recently at the end of ApriL The Fed said it acted in response to week money and creadit figures, declining infla- tion and concerns about the strength ot the economic recov- ery. The Commerce Department yesterday reported a 0.7 per cent fall in retail sales in August, the worst figure since January. Financial markets had expected a decline of only about 0.3 per cent. Separate figures showed a modest 0.2 per cent rise in August consumer prices, better than markets had expected. * Japanese government bonds climbed to new highs last week on hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates and thereby prompt the Bank of Japan to lower its oiM cial discount rate, currently at 5.5 per cent, Sarah Webb afds hrom aobln. Japanese government bonds continued to rally yesterday, although trading had closed before the US interest rate cut was announced.",

   "text_content" : "By John Lloyd in Moscow THE EMERGENCE of a sovereign Russia under the leadership of a powerful presi- dent is underlined by the new Russian constitution, now in its final draft. The constitution emphasises Russia's right to independence and to take charge of its own internal, foreign and defence policies, including a strategic nuclear arsenal. The draft marks a sharp break from the Soviet past and provides powerful legal back- ing for President Boris Yelt- sin's vision of a strong Russia freely delegating only limited powers to a union whose shape has yet to be delfined. The constitution, a copy of which the Financial Times obtained yesterday, ) says Rus- sia will delegate powers to a future union government only in specific cases. It maintains the right to withdraw such del- egatd powers at any time. Ukraine may run out of rubl.................. Page 2 The draft includes \"an inalienable right of property\" among a long list of guaran- teed human rights. The document, thrashed out over many months by a com- mission of experts in the Rus- sian parliament, reached its final form earlier this week. It will be considered by a prlia- mentary commission before a debate in the Russian earlia- ment by early next month, and submission to a popular refer- endum in November. The first clause proclaims: \"The Russian Federation is a sovereign democratic, legally based and social state of an historically united peoples...it independently determines and carries out domestic and for Caottwad on Page 22 Draft constitution ..tinue from Page 1 eign policies, adopts the Rus- sian Federation constitution and federal laws, which have supreme authority on its terri- tory. The state sovereignty of the Russian Federation is indi- visible.\" The draft proposes the appointment of a \"plenipoten- tiary for human rights\", responsible to parliament and charged with investigating abuses of human and civil rights. It affirms that the \"basis of the economy is formed by the social market, where freedom of economic activities, multi- plicity and equality of different forms of ownership, equal rights for their legal protection and fair competition are ensured\". The draft also promises that the state will provide free health care and education, ensure a minimum wage, pay social security to pensioners and invalids and provide housing to the low paid. In passages marking an explicit break with the commu- nist past, it rejects the idea of an official state ideology and prohibits state or other agencies from spying on citi- zens. In a conscious return to pre- revolutionary times, one of the two parliamentary chambers in the new parliament will be called the Duma. It will have 300 deputies elected from equal territorial districts.",

   "article_dc_title" : "US Sends Brady to Moscow for Talks on Reform",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Lionel Barber in Washington A HIGH-LEVEL US delegation headed by Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will travel to Moscow next week for inten- sive talks on a reform plan for the Soviet economy. The US team will meet repre- sentatives of the republics as well the central authorities, and will discuss the role of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in assisting economic reform, a senior US Treasury official said yester- day. The senior US official said the trip was more than a fact- finding mission. It was impor- tant to move ahead rapidly with the development of an economic reform plan ahead of next month's IMF/World Bank meeting in Bangkok, where the Soviet economy would be a major topic of discussion. It was agreed at the Group of Seven summit of industrialised countries that western finance ministers would visit Moscow to intensify the dialogue on economic reform. The dispatch of the high-level delegation for a three-day trip to Moscow between September 17 and 20 confirms the new sense of urgency within the administra- tion on the issue of economic aid. Officials have been frus- trated that the political debate over the future relationship between the republics and the centre in Moscow has slowed discussion on a credible plan for transition to a market econ- omy. The US would like to speed agreement on the Soviet Union's associate membership of the IMF so the Fund can make available much-needed technical advice. Full member- ship would create unnecessary distractions. The presence of Mr Green- span, the world's foremost cen- tral banker, suggests that the US intends to offer its own views on fiscal and monetary matters. However, the senior US officials said such questions were matters for the Soviets to work out themselves. On the other hand, the Trea- sury official issued a blunt warning on the issue of the Soviet Union's $62bn external debt. While a Soviet default or a rescheduling of the debt was not expected, the Soviet authorities needed to honour existing obligations. \"A disruption of payments could be extremely damaging to them,\" he said. \"It could cut off future credit flows to them.\" The US has shifted its posi- tion towards agreeing to offer direct assistance to the Soviet Union provided it puts forward a credible economic reform plan. However it remains wary of direct aid. The officials said the US, along with Japan, opposed raising the ceiling for Soviet borrowing from the European Bank for Resconstru- citon and Development (EBRD). Mr Greenspan travelled to Moscow in October 1989, one month after Mr Eduard Shev- ardnadze, then foreign minis- ter, told the US that the Soviet Union was seriously interested in economic reform. * Senior Soviet officials will visit Brussels next week to dis- cuss Moscow's surprise request for at least $6bn in food aid to prevent mass hunger next win- ter, Reuter reports. US and European Community trade representatives at a meeting in Angers, France, commented that the Soviet Union was ask- ing for a lot of money. \"It (the request) is rather high,\" EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said.",

   "text_content" : "CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pleaded for more aid to the Soviet Union and east- ern Europe and called on the US to. bear its share of this burden. \"All industrial states should contribute according to their ability, because the democrati- sation and economic redirec- tion in these countries are in the interest of the whole West,\" Mr Kohl said. In a lecture at the University of California in Berkeley yes- terday, the German chancellor said his country had already contributed heavily over the last two years both to the Soviet Union and to the coun- tries of eastern Europe. \"We have reached the bot- tom of the barrel,\" he said. \"The German government has always pressed for a fair international burden-sharing of aid to the Soviet Union and the reforming states of central and southeastern Europe.' While the US has pledged humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union and extended credits for food imports, President George Bush has remained more cau- tious than the other leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations on the question of Soviet aid, arguing that technical assistance is more urgent than financial resources. Chancellor Kohl is due to meet President Bush in Wash- ington next week.",

   "text_content" : "By George Graham in Washington THE RACE for next year's US presidential election widened yesterday when another candi- date joined the field bidding for the Democratic Party's nomi- nation. Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia yesterday formally declared he would run for the presidency, adding to a list of Democratic hopefuls weakened by the refusal of most of the party's heavyweights to take on President Bush. A silver-tongued trial lawyer with more than 20 years of state politics behind him, Mr Wilder is a controversial figure in his home state, where he has bemused voters by a series of bitter sqiuabbles with rival Democrats. But as the first black to be elected governor in the US, he could change the dynamics of the Democratic nomination process, which in recent years has been dictated by Mr Jesse Jackson's domination of black Wilder controversial iure votes in the southern states. Unlike Mr Jackson, Mr Wil- der appeals to centrist and white voters. He won his Vir- ginia office with an estimated 40 per cent of the white vote in this once segregationist southern state.",

   "text_content" : "\"Soviet Man\" have been spectacularly broken But a few vignettes from everyday Soviet life indicate that the state of mind incul- cated into three generations of citizens, could be the most dif- ncult \"reform\" of all. Take, for example, the hun- dreds of thousands of oil tank- ers clogging the overloaded railways. Each has a thick belt of congealed oil around its middle where oil has been spilt. Why? Because they are filled from the top as if oil were water until they over- flow. The losses are immense. Or take the mismatch between a uodetion and distri- butlon illustrated by a larg leld of tomatoes ripening in the sun not 2Okns from the port city of Odessa. The only visible link between the feld stretching to the horizon in all directions and the consumer was one small van and three old ladles with buckets. There were no tomatoes in the state shops of Odessa - but three kinds of sausages were being sold without queues in the streets. They had come across the Black sea from Bulgaria. But the vaga- ries of the distribution system meant that few would get beyond the port except in the suitcases of travellers. That helps explain why a country which this year is expecting a grain harvest of 195m tonnes still \"needs\" to import 30 to 40m tonnes. imported grain arrives conve- niently at a port where it can be put into trains and then unloaded into a state-owned rail-side silo or bread factory. It does not have to bump over rutted mud roads in broken down trucks from far-flung collective farms whose work- er have nothing to buy with the roubles they receive and therefore no incentive to part with the produce. Growing tomatoes in a gigantic field is Just one instance of a mania for size which has bequeathed the Soviet Union some of the larg- est industrial plants in the world - not to mention the world's heaviest chandeliers, the biggest micro-chips and mind-boggling monuments to heroes and battles weighing hundreds of tons and laid out over dozens of acres. But the ceaseless propa- ganda campaigns which accompanied the construction of the great projects of past five-year plans - from Stalin's dams, canals and steel plants to Brezhnev's car and truck plants and Siberian railway - were switched off after com- pletion. In the same way the new plants, oil fields or pipe- lines on which billions of rou- bles and dollars were lavished in construction were then deprived of prudent deprecia- tion allowances or working capital once operational. Western oil companies, espe- cially those operating in harsh climatic regions, typically allo- cate about 15 per cent of the overall project budget to main- tenance of pipelines and pump- ing stations. In the Soviet Union the average is about 1 per cent. It will take an accounting revolution for western-style depreciation to be adopted. Until then, pipe- line explosions and factory breakdowns, will continue to cause a decline in output of oil and other products. However the potential for gaining rapid and substantial productivity increases by changing attitudes gives ground for hope. Substituting western-style accounting and project evaluation methods for the political imperative of the five year plan could prove more effective than large scale new investment. That is what economists drafting economic strategies and newly-empowered Soviet managers are counting on.",

   "text_content" : "By Mark Nicholso n in Moscow TEE Soviet Union yesterday removed another longstanding irritant in its relations with Washington by agreeing with the US to halt military supplies to Afghanistan by January. The joint declaration was announced after talks between Mr James Baker, the US Secretary of State, and Mr Boris Pankin, his Soviet counterpart, and is designed to clear the way for the for- mation of a new transitional govern- ment in Afghanistan, followed by UN- supervised elections. Soviet agreement to the deal follows concerted US pressure on Moscow throughout the three years since Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan. It is the third Soviet diplomatic about-turn in a week, coming after Soviet recogni- tion of the Baltic states and the move to withdraw 11,000 troops from Cuba. Mr Baker expressed \"delight\" at the latest fruit of the post-coup transforma- tion in Soviet foreign policy yesterday, saying: \"This removes three of the most contentions 'old agenda' issues that have impeded progress.\" US government officials said the joint declaration had effectively been agreed last year - even down to the wording - at the Houston meeting between Mr Baker and Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, then Soviet foreign min- ister, but that hardliners in the Soviet leadership had stymied the deal. Their OLD PALS ACT: James Baker greets former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow demise after the failed coup removed the impediment to the Afghan deal, and to recognition of the Baltics and cuts in military aid to Cuba. The deal is a domestic economic and political fillip to both Washington and Moscow. The Soviet Union poured at least $400m in aid into the regime of President Najibullah in Kabul, mostly in the form of guns, ammun iton, artil- lery and hundreds of Scud missiles. Moscow also flies huge quantities of food and fuel to Kabul - aid which US officials say they will also urge Moscow to cut. US military aid to the Mujahideen rebels, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, had reached $500m a year, but has recently been running into stiff resistance in Congress. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also pro- vided aid, and US officials yesterday said they would press both countries to halt assistance and help broker peace in the country under the terms of last May's five-point UN peace plan, which calls for the formation of an interim government before full elections. Mr Najibullah welcomed the accord.",

   "text_content" : "THE Soviet budget deficit is likely to exceed Rbs200bn this year, the Finance Ministry said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. The Tass news agency said the figure - almost 10 times the planned deficit for 1991 - was given yesterday at a meet- ing of the Economic Manage- ment Committee. Mr Ivan Silayev, Russian Federation prime minister who heads the committee, rebuked Mr Vladimir Rayevsky, first deputy finance minister, for failing to present measures to reduce the deficit, and suggested purchases of mili- tary equipment be reduced to try and slash spending. Mr Silayev said workers at military plants should be kept- on the payroll, however, to encourage them to move to civilian production. Exports have plummeted this year, depriving the Soviet Union of needed hard currency to to pay for imports. Tass said the committee ordered the finance ministry to prepare detailed proposals for slashing budget expenditure. Mr Rayevsky told the com- mittee that the 1991 deficit was projected at Rbsl44bn. With credits from the Soviet state bank added in, the deficit would total more than Rbs200bn ($333bn at the official rate). -While the amount sounds enormous when converted at the official rate used in inter- national transactions, much of it is internal deficit. Foreigners can already officially change $1 for Rbs32. On that basis, the new deficit would be only about $6bn. Yesterday, the committee also rejected plans presented for keeping industries supplied in 1992, saying they provided too little leeway for a market economy, Tass said. The 12 Soviet republics and three Baltic states were asked to review the scheme.",

The accord comes at the end of the week in which more than 120 people died in various incidents in Transvaal town. Sgovernment, the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party have all stated that the events of the past week merely underscore the need for a penace accord. At least thirty other organi- sations will sign the accord, but the right wing Conserva- tive Party will be staying away while the Pan Africanist Con- gress and Aapo, two radical lack parties, will attend but not sign the accord. They object, amongst other things, to the legitimacy the accord gives to the government and its security organs. The accord is the result of months of negotiations. Fol- lowing a government convened summit earlier in the year, which the ANC did not attend, a committee of business and church leaders worked to get all the main parties around the same table. Features of the draft docu- ment include the setting up of a permanent, paid, multi-party national peace committee; spe- cial courts to deal with politi- cal violence and codes of con- duct for political actors and security forces. Although there are high hopes for the peace accord, there s also recognition that a formidable task les ahead in giving ffect to its principles at the graroots level ad ensur- ing that violence does not recur at street evel.",

   "text_content" : "By Sara Webb TWO international fund management groups have dropped plans to launch funds investing in South African stocks, citing township clashes and worries that US state pen- sion funds might withdraw business. The decisions by Baring Securities and Genesis Invest- ment Management come at a time when South Africa is pre- paring its first public bond oawering since 1965. It hopes to raise DM200m-DM250m (Â£68m- E85m) from foreign investors. Genesis, which has $420m (Â£249m) under management, decided not to proceed with a fund investing in second-tier South African stocks and stocks from southern African countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana and Swaziland. Genesis had approached about 60 institutions to gauge their interest in the fund. Despite initial interest, it seemed unlikely that the fund would be able to attract its minimum target of $25m. \"The violence last week has not helped sentiment,\" said a spokesman for the group. Baring Securities had also discussed the possibility of launching a South Africa fund in conjunction with South Africa's UAL Merchant Bank. It shelved plans because of worries that Baring Asset Man- agement (BAM), its fund man- agement arm, would lose valu- able US state pension fund business. BAM claims to be the lead- ing non-US manager of US pen- sion funds. It manages a total $29bn worldwide of which $4.9bn is US pension fund money. \"We have taken a view that we do not want to be associ- ated with South Africa, although we can buy and sell South African shares, among other markets, on behalf of cli- ents,\" said a director of Baring Securities. The Barings/UAL fund would have invested mainly in South African shares, but would also have examined the possiblity of investing in pro- jects in other southern African countries. Old Mutual, South Africa's largest life insurance company, recently announced plans to launch a $50m South Africa investment company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Smith New Court Securities, which is sponsoring and under- writing the placement, said that several UK and European institutions had expressed an interest in the fund, but that it was too early to say how much money had been raised from investors. Smith New Court said that a recent poll of 110 UK institu- tions revealed that 25 per cent already invest directly in South African equities, while 45 per cent are changing their views on investment as a result of recent political reforms in South Africa. However, Ethical Investment Research Service, said that eth- ical investors did not believe that the time had come to start investing in South Africa yet.",

Mr Khazbulatov, emphasised Russia sought a \"stage-by- stage\" return to normal rela- tions with Japan, culminating in a peace treaty with its war- time foe.

Mr Mykhailo Shvaika, dep- uty head of the parliamentary commission on economic reform, said the Ukrainian National Bank had cash reserves of only Rbslbn. The bank needed between Rbs9bn and Rbsl2bn to pay wages in the republic each month. Officials from the Ukrainian National Bank confirmed that due to \"technical problems\" Gosbank, the Soviet central bank, had not provided the Ukraine with enough cash. Mr Mykola Tumanov, deputy director of the Ukrainian National Bank, denied the situ- ation was grave, but said Gos- bank simply could not print money fast enough to keep up with the wage and price increases in the country. Opposition politicians, who now command a majority in parliament, fear the Kremlin and Boris Yeltsin's Russian parliament are trying to create a crisis in the Ukraine to force republic to remain in some sort of political union. However, starving the Ukraine of roubles would be counter-productive for Mr Yelt- sin. As Mr Shvaika himself says: \"This will force us to introduce our own money and not to depend on anyone.\" * More than 30 years after a nuclear weapons plant exploded in the Urals, Soviet television on Thursday reported that 400,000 people were affected by doses of radia- tion higher than the 1986 Cher- nobyl disaster, AP reports.

   "text_content" : "THIS was the week when an immovable President Bush squared up to the hitherto irre- sistible force in US politics: the American Jewish lobby. The battle turns on Israel's request for $10bn in loan guar- antees needed to help finance settlements for thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrds. Mr Bush wants a 120-day delay so as not to jeopardise a prospec- tive Middle East peace confer- ence; the Israelis want the guarantees, now. \"I'm one lonely little guy down here,\" said Mr Bush on Thursday as he complained about a horde of hostile lobby- ists on Capitol Hill seeking to drum up support for Israel. Conventional wisdom has been that US presidents who take on Israel and the well-or- ganised, well-financed Jewish lobby are either brave or stu- pid. The same applies to the US Congress, where most mem- bers have at some time or another taken campaign money from the estimated 70 or more political action com- mittees (pacs) in the US with pro-Israeli ties. The most powerful pro-Is- raeli group is the American Israel Public Affairs commit- tee, known by its acronym Aipac. This group is careful to avoid being labelled a political The US president has dared to do the unthinkable, writes Lionel Barber action committee; but it has close ties with other pacs and is widely credited with the defeat of pro-Arab Senate and House candidates in the 1980s, notably former Senator Charles Percy of Illinois who led the fight in 1981 to sell AWACs surveillance aircraft to Saudi Arabia. These defeats contributed to the impression that the Israeli lobby reigned supreme in Washington. But since Mr Bush came to office in 1989, the tables have begun to turn. First, Israel's intransigence in the so-called peace process - heightened by the willing- ness of Egypt, Syria and other Arab states to sit down and talk - has caused Jerusalem to be seen as \"part of the prob- lem rather than part of the solution,\" says one US official. Television pictures of Israeli soliders have further contrib- uted to Israel's image of aggressor rather than victim. Second, the Bush cabinet - unlike the Reagan cabinet - shows no sign of splits on Mid- dle East policy. After initial hesitation, Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, has made a peace conference a top priority. Like Mr Bush, Mr Baker does not like losing. Lastly, Mr Bush has cast the loan guarantee in terms of an historic opportunity for peace. In this respect, the compari- sons with the AWACS battle in 1981 are misleading. This is no mere argument over a few high-technology weapons which could, potentially threaten Israel's security; this is about face-to-face'negotia- tions between Israel and its Arab neighbours, about the ultimate question of the future shape and security of Israel. At the same time, Mr Bush may be gambling on a cruder calculation. The signs are that the US Congress is taking a much harder-nosed attitude to foreign aid, even to long-time allies such as Israel. This attitude explains why Mr Bush was so adamant this week that he would not make a new offer to the Philippines on the use of the Subic Naval Base. Israel is not the Philip- pines, but Mr Bush still has a strong hand to play.",

Mr James Baker, the US Sec- retary of State, and Mr Boris Pankin, his Soviet counterpart, discussed the wording of invi- tations to the conference yes- terday - their second meeting this week - but failed to find a workable formula.

Mr Pankin said this week he also planned to visit the region for the first time as foreign minister before the conference, but only after he had led the Soviet delegation to next Tues- day's opening of the UN Gen- eral Assembly's annual ses- sion. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, the special Soviet envoy to the Middle East, is on a tour of the region. A spokesman for the foreign ministry said yester- day, however, that Mr Prima- kov's visit was primarily con- cerned with \"economic issues\", effectively a search for eco- nomic aid from the Gulf states.",

   "text_content" : "By Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw and Anthony Robinson in London THE communist-dominated Polish parliament's relations with President Lech Walesa worsened yesterday when dep- uties failed to approve Mr Marek Dabrowski, the presi- dent's nominee, as head of the National Bank of Poland. Mr Dabrowski, who was determined to contain inflation by maintaining monetary con- trols, even at the cost of a deepening recession, fell foul of a coalition of farming deputies, the former communist group and right wing Solidarity supporters anx- ious to see an end to the reces- sion. The 40-year-old economist served last year as deputy finance minister. Mr Dabrowski's appointment as head of the bank, which is independent of the govern- ment, was intended to signal that controls on money supply would be maintained whatever the outcome of general elec- tions on October 27. Meanwhile, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), one of nine Polish state-owned com- mercial banks hived off from the central bank two years ago, has been selected as the first for privatisation, with the help of a consortium of UK and Pol- ish advisers. Schroders, the UK merchant bank, will lead the consortium which includes accountants and consultants from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte's UK and Polish offces, with legal advice from Alien and Overy and Tomasz Wardynski and partners, a Polish law firm.

He was speaking after a visit to Tehran which started a gradual process to resolve the issue. However Mr Perez De Cuel- lar warned against raised expectations in case of unfore- seen hitches. His reticence was underscored by an incident in south Lebanon yesterday in which a Swedish UN soldier was killed in a clash between Israeli forces and Palestinian guerrillas. The incident, though not directly related, illustrated the fragility of relationships between the parties involved in the hostage talks. Israeli and UN versions of the clash differed sharply. The latest piece in the maca- bre hostage jigsaw fell into place yesterday when the body of an Israeli soldier captured by Palestinians in 1983 was returned home.

   "text_content" : "Bv David Churchill, Leisure Industries Correspondent THE Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) yesterday terminated the membership of two Keith Prowse travel com- panies after talks with the receivers from accountancy firm Grant Thornton. Keith Prowse Travel and Keith Prowse Travel (Northern Ireland) had their licences to sell Abta members' package holidays revoked after it became clear to the receivers that a buyer for the operations was unlikely to be found. However, a third Keith Prowse travel company - Wil- liams Travel - remains trad- ing and in Abta membership as the receivers hope to sell it as a going concern next week. The two travel companies which have lost their Abta licence to operate were not put in receivership last Monday along with other Keith Prowse companies, as to do so would have automatically forced them to cease trading. How- ever, they are likely to go into receivership next week. If they do cease trading it should not disrupt the holiday plans of consumers who have booked through them, Abta said last night. All package holidays sold through the Keith Prowse shops are cov- ered by the bond lodged with Abta. Meanwhile, about three seri- ous purchasers have emerged for the Keith Prowse ticket operation, according to Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the joint receivers from Grant Thorn- ton. \"It's a very complex situa- tion and I am aware that time is not on our side to find a buyer,\" he said. London theatres have agreed to honour all Keith Prowse tickets, but are anxious that the situation should be clari- led as soon as possible. The theatres hope that any buyer would reimburse them for tick- ets already honoured, but this is increasingly unlikely if a buyer is to be found. Mr Griffiths said that Mr Dev Anand, one of the owners of the Keith Prowse group, was working with the Modern Group, the new owners of the Expotel hotel reservations agency which the receivers sold last Monday. Mr Ranjit Anand was \"totally exhausted\", added Mr Griffiths. A third director, Mr Paul Burns, was helping sort out the confusion surrounding cor- porate hospitality packages. Meanwhile Mr Keith Rich- ards, legal officer with the Con- sumers' Association, yesterday suggested that a small levy could be applied to theatre tickets in future to provide insurance for consumers. 'There is a real need to protect consumers who pay out in advance for their tickets,\" he said. 0 British Airways said last night that the Concorde flights chartered by Keith Prowse for players and supporters of the European Ryder Cup golf team would go ahead. BA said it would operate the flights to the tournament in South Carolina, in the US, and the costs would be covered by the Professional Golfers' Asso- ciation and Johnnie Walker, the team sponsor. BA said it would honour tickets issued by Keith Prowse on its scheduled services. Passengers who could prove they had paid Keith Prowse in full before it ceased trading would have tickets issued to them. The show goes on, Weekend Page IV",

   "text_content" : "Shortage of police resources denied By Alan Pike and Ralph Atkins THE government yesterday dismissed suggestions that inadequate police resources had been a factor in this week's riots on Tyneside. The denial followed a claim by Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, that Sir Stan- ley Bailey, chief constable of Northumbria, had told him his force had 500 officers fewer than it needed. \"Sir Stanley was explicit in saying that on each night of the disturbances he did not possess sufficient resources both to contain those who caused it and to arrest the ringleaders,\" Mr Hattersley said. ' Mr John Patten, home office minister, said the figures were \"news to me and news to us in the Home Office\". Northum- bria had only 87 fewer police officers than it should, he said. Last month Northumbria lobb- ied the Home Office for funds for a further116 officers. MeaRiiile 'cicald auithority leaders miet Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, in London to demand increased police spending-. -The meetingh; arranged some time ago, was given added urgency by the present inner-city unrest. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Patten argued that part of the answer to the recent riots was stronger locks on cars, more care by car owners of their vehicles and tough sentencing by courts. Local communities also had to act collectively to stem dis- turbances centred on car crime, he said. Increases in the number of police officers would help, he acknowledged, but force levels Thin blue line: controversyv has erunted about nolice numbers in the Newcastle riotinm were already projected to rise. Home Office figures out yes- terday shpwed a record 18 per cent increase in recorded crime between June 1990 and June 1991. Nearly a third of crimnies -now involve stialing cars or *4reaking hfto them.; Crimes of violence, however, rose by only 5 per cent in the 12 months to June - half the rate of increase of recent years. Mr Patten, re-emphasising attempts by ministers to shift blame for the past week's riot- ing across the country to the individuals and communities concerned, said that courts would be able to hand down tough \"deterrent\" sentences. After the meeting with Mr Baker, Mr George Gill, chair- man of Northumbria police authority - the force responsi- ble for policing Tyneside - has erupted about police num said the home secretary had shown sympathy, but had not offered extra cash. Mr Baker said he believed the events on Tyneside could be repeated in ot4er metropoli- :tan areas, and addedd: \"I idn't. ometledwn here fipatNitty I came down here for action as we haven't got any.\" The council leaders told Mr Baker that police forces faced a financial crisis which was keeping officers off the beat. All six metropolitan police authorities had their budgets capped in 1991-92 and the coun- cils fear that they will be capped again in the coming financial year. The delegation told Mr Baker that since pay accounted for 80 per cent of police costs, reductions in expenditure inevitably led to shortages in police numbers. Loers in me nlewcUsbue nUULng The councillors argued that average spending increases of 8 per cent would be needed in 1992,93-simply to maintain the 1991-92 reduced level of sqBritice , An increase of about 1' per wbentftwould- be needed to \"treover lost ground. Chief constables from areas affected by the disturbances met Sir John Woodcock, chief inspector of constabulary yes- terday to review the position. Mr John Owen, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said afterwards that the police were well-equipped to deal with any further prob- lems. \"Our officers are well pro- tected, well trained, well schooled, well led, and I have at the slightest doubt that we wW deal with whatever hap- pens on the streets,\" he said.",

   "text_content" : "A DAMNING report on Derbyshire's police force by Mr Geoffrey Dear, chief inspector of constabulary, could lead to the Home Office refusing to release cash support - amounting to Â£30m a year. Mr Dear said after an inspec- tion in May and June this year he was unable to recommend a certificate of efficiency. An \"acute feeling of desperation\" had crept in. Senior officers were having to concede more ground to hooligans in the street as no back-up could be expected when scanty resources were deployed to incidents. Mr Bob Jones, chairman of the Derbyshire police author- ity, accused Mr Dear of politi- cising the force's plight with \"anecdotes and careless lan- guage\". He. rejected Mr Dear's claim that parts of the county were no longer patrolled. Mr Dear previously inspected the force last Decem- ber and reported that it was \"on the brink of inefficiency\" and being \"strangled by red tape\". He accused the Labour- controlled county council of political interference, with' a drastic effect on morale. In his second report he said the situation was alarming and had deteriorated. Mr Jones said: \"Mr Dear accuses us of starving the police of cash over many years but fails to admit that every year for the last nine years we have invested more money in the police service than the gov- ernment says is necessary.\" \"It is only this year, when faced with poll tax capping, that we have been forced to reduce (the) budget to exactly what the government says we should spend on the police. \"And yet Mr Dear is recom- mending to the home secretary that a certificate should be withheld.\" Mr John Newing, Derbyshire chief constable, accused Mr Dear of alarmist language but said: \"It is about resources. On that matter, Mr Dear and I are as one: the force is under-re- sourced.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in Washington THE Federal Reserve Board and the Fed- | 1 | eral Reserve | Bank of New York were sharply critic- ised by mem- bers of the Banking Committee of the US House of Representa- tives yesterday for what the committee chairman called an \"abysmal\" performance in investigating Bank of Credit and Cmmerce International. Mr Henry Gonzalez, commit- tee chairman, also attacked what he called the Fed's \"unbe- lievably light treatment\" of a 19 tip from the US Internal Revenue Service that there was strong evidence of BCCI having secret control of First American, the Washington bank that was chaired by Mr Cark Clffoard, the former pres- idential adviser. Mr Virgil Mattigly, general counsel of the Federal Reserve, said the Fed is considering whether to take action against Mr Clifford if it determines he misled US bank regulators over BCCrs secret control of Frst A rican The Fed law- yer said he was asurprised to discover in early 1991 that Mr Clifford and his law partner Mr Robert Altman had borrowed millions of dollars from BCCI to fund the purchase of shares in Credit and Commerce Amer- ican Holdings (CCAH), the vehicle BCCI used to acquire control of First American. Mr Mattingly also disclosed that former US government officials had received a series of loans from First American, but he declined to name the officials. The banking committee was especially critical of the Fed- eral Reserve for having failed to learn about a 1988 audit report from Price Waterhouse, BCCIs auditor, that showed kOM of loans made by BCCI to front men who held shares In CCAH. The information was available to the Bank of England and other amambra of a central bank college of super- visors that was formed to mon- itr BCCL The committee released a letter it received last week from Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of fngland, ia which he reveaed tht the coDege had discuadI the ae of CCAR shares \"e a number of occasions\" since 1988. The Federal Reserve was criticised for not having joined the college, but Mr Gerald Cor- rigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the \"sole preoccupation\" of the college was to restruc- ture BCCL \"We didn't want to be a party to the process. We wanted them out of business,\" he said. The US central bank officials who testified said they were only informed of the PW report disclosing the BCCI-CCAH loans in 1991. Mr Gonzalez, clearly unim- pressed by Mr Corrigan's testi- mony, said: \"Either you are very naive or very defensive. If you had joined the college of supervisors the Bank of England would have shared with you the 19M Price Water- 1 don't think we should tol- erate obfuscation in an attempt to justify omiuserM.\" Mr Corigan alowed that In retreupect we l he done things a Ittle d \" but insisted the time that might have been saved in lenng more about BCCI and Pst American was a matter of months, not years. He added: \"The possibility exists that there may have been information available to other federal agencies that might have expedited the Fed- eral Reserve's investigation had we got the information.\" He argued that the scope and complexity of the DCCI investi- gation and the \"unimaginable pattern of deceit, les and mis- representations\" had made the investigation more difficult. Mr Joseph Kennedy, a Demo- crat from Massachusetts, said the committee needed to learn more about the Central Intelli- gence Agency and \"its under- standing with regard to what was going on at BCI going back many years\". Mr Kenn edy said he wished to investl- gate the CIA's \"potential involvement in grt.ni the Fed or the Department of Jstice to back off certain investiga- tons\".

   "text_content" : "By Allson Smith THE government is discussing with local authorities two pos- sible changes to the method of assessing the amount councils should be spending. The first change would be to remove highway maintenance from the standard spending assessments (SSAs), which affect how government distrib- utes grants to councils, by treating it as capital spending rather than revenue. Some authorities believe that this signals a further move towards making councils compete for central government grants, as has happened with the City Challenge scheme. The second change would increase the allowance made for the number of overnight visitors to each local authority. This would favour areas with large numbers of tourists, such as Westminster, and seaside towns. The alterations were dis- cussed yesterday at a meeting of the settlement working group, made up of officials from the Department of the Environment and representa- tives from the local authority associations. The SSAs have consistently been a subject of disagreement between the government and local authorities. They have been criticised by Tory-led and other councils alike as in need of far-reaching reform. Labour has especially critic- ised recent changes, which it says unfairly favoured the Tory-controlled London bor- oughs of Westminster and Wandsworth, helping them set low poll tax levels. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said yesterday: \"Despite all the evidence, the government has still refused to make funda- mental changes to the SSA sys- tem. The proposed tinkering is once again designed to benefit their friends rather than address the real issues.\" * There were signs yesterday that even the Tory-dominated local authority associations could be reaching the conclu- sion that the government's plans for personal discounts may make the council tax inoperable. Although the council tax will be based broadly on the value of people's homes, dis- counts for single-person house- holds and for certain other cat- egories, such as student nurses, are proposed. Benefit experts say that diffi- culties will arise in meshing the discounts with the rebate system. The government intends to introduce the council tax in April 1993, but delays in solv- ing such complexities risk it being delayed until the follow- ing year.",

   "text_content" : "By Rachel Johnson, Economics Staff YESTERDAY'S fall in retail price inflation to 4.7 per cent, its lowest level for three years, owes more to last year's petrol price rise during the Gulf crisis than to an across-the-board price slowdown this year. The retail prices index increased by 0.2 per cent in August this year, but by a full 1 per cent in the same month last year. This delivered a 0.8 point drop in inflation from July's 5.5 per cent. Motoring expenditure costs increased by an annual 7.3 per cent last month, after 9.5 per cent in July; the rise in fuel and light prices was down to 7.6 per cent, after a previous 9 per cent. A gallon of four-star petrol fell by Ip to Â£2.28 a gallon; unleaded by a penny to Â£2.12. Contrast this to last August, when the outbreak of Gulf hos- tilities added 0.2 percentage points to the RPI. This year's motoring and petrol impact on the index was a mere 0.05 points. Lower oil prices, and the government's ability to cut interest rates in the recession, have helped Mr Norman Lam- ont, the chancellor, to preside over retail price inflation almost halved from 9 per cent in March. The deep consumer down- turn and the Â£140 per head reduction in average poll tax bills enabled Mr Lamont to raise value added tax to 17.5 per cent in the Budget without adding to the RPI. The switch to indirect taxation - VAT - was almost entirely offset by the 30 per cent cut in a direct tax - the community charge - and the sharp slowdown in domestic demand. This helped him avoid the inflationary pressures that Germany is fighting to crush, which have resulted from the series of THERE is no indication of any easing of the recession for British construction and build- ing material companies, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. These showed that construc- tion output fell 9 per cent in the three months to the end of June, compared with the corre- sponding period last year. Worst affected was commer- cial output, mainly for offices and shops, which was 13.8 per cent lower than in April, May government-administered tax increases to finance unifica- tion. July's German tax package, designed to limit the burgeon- ing budget deficit, added as much as 0.9 points to that month's cost of living index, taking the annual inflation rate to 4.4 per cent and trigger- ing a rise in German interest rates. Mr Lamont was also helped by a fall in housing costs in the wake of the half-point cut in mortgage interest rates gener- ally introduced at the begin- ning of August. The influence of these cuts can be seen in the index which strips out mortgage interest payments (mips). This remains above the headline rate, falling to 6.2 per cent in August, after a previous 6.8 per cent. The inclusion of mips in the head line \"general\" index lowered it by 0.13 percentage points. Only the large outstanding stock of mortgage debt prevented a big- ger fall. Without these \"special sac- tors\", economists find the infla- tion picture less attractive, in spite of the ceaseless efforts of Britain's retailers to drum up trade with price discounts. \"This RPI is disappointing - and June last year. The figures indicate that the recession in the building industry, already severe, is worsening. Output in April, May and June this year was 3 per cent lower than in the preceding three months, the department said. Most worrying is the col- lapse of the office construction market in south-east England. The National Council of Build- ing Materials Producers has forecast commercial output will fall 20 per cent this year and 30 per cent in 1992. as the last two were,\" said Mr Ian Harnett, economist at Societe Gendrale Strauss Turn- bull. The median market expectation was for a fall in the annual rate to 4.5 per cent. Apart from food, clothing and footwear, tobacco, and leisure services, all categories of the index were still rising by more than 7 per cent a year, Mr Har- nett pointed out. Seasonal food prices per- formed one of their intermit- tent August jumps as a result of a rainy summer. Potato prices helped the index of sea- sonal food prices rise by 3.7 percentage points to 8.4 per cent in August. Fish, milk, cheese and beer prices all rose. The general index of retail prices in August was 134.1 (January 1987= 100), after 133.8 in July. The outlook for inflation is mixed. It is going to get better, then worse, with a tight sinan- cial strategy required to keep UK inflation at German levels next year. The October RPI is set to fall to just 3.2 per cent, but then rise again above 4 per cent as last year's mortgage-rate cuts - which started in November - drop out of the year-on-year comparisons. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Albright and Wilson also disclosed yesterday that it has started High Court proceed- ings against Greenpeace, on which a writ has been served, for trespass to recover dam- ages caused by the attempt to block the pipelines. The company estimates that the cost of damage and lost production will run into six figures. It is also seeking a perma- nent injunction restraining Greenpeace campaigners from such action in the future. Greenpeace said it would obey the temporary injunc- tion, but would fight any legal attempt to curb its activities permanently. \"We take action to defend the environment and we will defend this case in the same way,\" the group said. Albright and Wilson, a sub- sidiary of American conglom- erate Tenneco, has been tar- geted in Greenpeace's campaign to force the National Rivers Authority to take a harder line on pollution. Greenpeace is seeking a judi- cial review of the NRA to force it to take tougher action. Albright and Wilson, which has permission from the NRA to discharge about 500 tonnes of heavy metals into the Irish Sea each year, has denied Greenpeace allegations that it is exceeding this limit. Last month, in the first suce cessful private prosecution under the Water Act, Green- peace prosecuted the company for exceeding its allowed lev- els. Albright and Wilson, which was fined the maximum Â£2,000 and ordered to pay Greenpeace Â£20,000 costs, is considering an appeal. \"We were shocked that being involved in the process of law, in which they have taken us to court, they are tak- ing this violent action against the discharge,\" Albright and Wilson said.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry corresponaent FORD'S exports of cars and commercial vehicles from the UK to continental European markets are expected almost to triple this year to 173,987 from 64,475 last year. Exports of engines are expec- ted to rise to nearly Im from 800,000 in 1990. Mr Derek Barron, Ford of Britain's chairman, said the company's vehicle and engine exports this year would be the highest since 1979. The surge in exports reflects high levels of new vehicle sales in Germany this year, Ford's success in the Italian market and the drop in UK demand. About half of Ford's produc- tion of its Fiesta small car range will be exported this year, mainly to France and Italy, compared with about 16 per cent in 1990. Production of the Fiesta at Ford's Dagenham, Essex plant is forecast to rise by 16 per cent to 211,105 from 186,952. Output of the Dagenham assembly plant was concen- trated exclusively on the Fiesta last year, when Ford trans- ferred all its UK production of the Sierra large family car to its factory in Genk, Belgium. UK new-car sales dropped by 22 per cent in the first eight months of the year, but Ford has under-performed the mar- ket with a 25.9 per cent drop in its UK sales volume of new cars. This has cut its market share to 23.8 per cent from 25 per cent a year ago. Car output from the Hale- wood, Merseyside plant car output of the Escort/Orion range is forecast to fall to 86,479 from 88,031 in 1990, a year when output was depressed by a seven-week clo- sure through industrial action.

   "text_content" : "FIRST-TIME house buy- ers should have every- thing in their favour; the economy shows signs of recovery, prices have gone down and the cost of borrow- ing has fallen substantially. Unfortunately for the prop- erty sector their activities are not expected to buoy the mar- ket until well into next year. With a record level of house repossessions and mortgage arrears the property market is expected to remain dead until the end of the year, dragging estate agents, mortgage lend- ers, insurers and construction companies down with it. Mr John Wriglesworth, hous- ing market analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew, predicts that the situation is going to get worse this year. The main cause for concern, he argues, is the high level of loans more than 12 months in arrears. In August the Council of Mortgage Lenders released figures which showed that 36,610 dwellings were repos- sessed during the first half of the year. There were 59,690 loans more than 12 months in arrears. These, says Mr Wrigles- worth, are likely to turn into repossessions. Previously peo- ple who found themselves in arrears were able to hand in their keys, put their property back on the market, and recoup their losses. Now, most house prices are below their values in the late 1980s and selling prices are not enough to cover accumulated arrears. By repossessing, lenders add to the stock of unsold, empty housing - a stock which is soaking up demand so that there is no movement in house prices. This in turn has made building societies and banks more cautious in their lending. Abbey National has not been offering 100 per cent mortgages Emma Tucker and Richard Lapper on the gloomy outlook for property since the beginning of the year. Halifax is making very few 100 per cent loans. Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax's group corporate development manager, believes 100 per cent lending will disappear alto- gether, moving Britain closer to European practice. In addition, the impact of the increase in the rate of unem- ployment is likely to reverber- ate beyond those actually out of work. Mr Wriglesworth points out that those in work will feel insecure as long as the jobless rate is rising, making them less likely to take out loans on new houses. property market has added to the difficulties of the insurance industry, which was already suffering from an upsurge in weather losses and recession-related claims. Over the past six months most leading companies have paid claims on their mortgage indemnity policies, an insur- ance which protects the lender against any losses incurred when a repossessed property is sold. More importantly, compa- nies have set aside huge amounts in provisions to pay for future claims that they believe will emerge when all repossessed properties are sold. Most policies cover lenders against losses equivalent to 25 or 30 per cent of the loan. Even so the provisions have had a substantial impact on the bot- tom line pushing one company, Legal & General, into the red for the first time. Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance, which each control about 20 per cent of the mar- ket, reported claims of Â£50m and Â£45m respectively. Eagle Star, which has a 15 per cent market share, made a more cautious assessment of future claims. Legal & General made an even more conservative assessment, providing against claims it believes will emerge when mortgages currently in arrears go into default. Mr Chris Hitchings, analyst with stockbrokers Hoare Govett, believes that for the year as a whole mortgage indemnity losses could amount to as much as Â£12bn. Estate agents are also floun- dering from low turnover in the market and some have crit- icised building societies for not putting enough effort into sell- ing repossessed houses. Mr Trevor Kent, a former president of the National Asso- ciation of Estate Agents, says the system whereby lenders are reluctant to come to a deal on selling the house with a borrower until the house has been repossessed means bor- rowers are losing both their homes and their credit ratings. Often the deals that borrow- ers come to with buyers before repossession are less than what they bought the house for, but still better than a deal struck by the building society several months later when the house has been languishing on the market. Mr Kent argues that all parties - borrower, lender and insurer - could come to better arrangements. For housebuilders, the glut of unsold housing is an added burden in one of the worst years experienced. Property, Weekend FT, Page xII",

   "text_content" : "By Enmu Tucker IN THE next few weeks the Abbey National building sodc ety is due to repossess the home of Mr Jaroslav Klech, a 47-year-old carpenter and joiner. Mr Klech, who lives in Wal- ington, Surrey, is one of 73,000 people expected to lose their houses through mortgage debt this year. His family does not qualify for local authority rehousing - the citizens' advice bureau told Mr Klech he stood virtu ally no chance, because he has a grown-up son and is in full-time employment. The family house, which cost Â£180,000 some five years ago, and was valued at Â£265,000 18 months ago, will go on the market at less than Â£200,000. The Klechs' mortgage was Â·tl 1: IrÂ· i '1 u.-r: Â·Â·,:.Â·: : \"4 ~iP17 ir:. :ii^ a ;....~ s brck at the tamilp home which the b~ildin~ sodety is soon to repaurars Â£224,000 after they had the property remortgaged. They fell into arrears in January. Mr Klech, whose carpentry company went into liquidation at the start of the year, looks almost bemused at the tum- bling down of his assets in the recession. He now works for a small contracting company. A lifelong Tory voter, he says he will not vote Conserva- tive again. But he reserves most bitterness for the banks. \"The banks were very keen to lend me God knows how much money. I could have bor- rowed whatever I liked,\" he said. \"Then as soon as they got twitchy they started calling everything in.\" In January Mr Klech's bank, the Midland, with whom he had a Â£60,000 business loan, suggested he go into liquida- tion. He had already contacted a liquidator and worked out a package to keep the business alive for three to four months. Mr Klech believed promises of work would have yielded enough money to save the company. The bank refused. He also contacted his build- ing society, the Abbey National, explaining that he would not be able to keep up his Â£2,300 monthly repayments. After two months they asked for the house keys. Mr Klech refused until he found alterna- tive accommodation. Rents for three-bedroomed houses in the area, where his younger son was still in full- time education, averaged Â£800 a month. When a court order arrived from Abbey National's solicitors telling him he had 28 days to leave he chose to make a court appearance. A sympathetic magistrate gave him two more months. As with the bank, Mr Klech made a number of suggestions to Abbey National to try to prevent eviction. He also suggested his family remain in the house while it was on the market. He said the building society did not respond. A spokesman for Abbey National said it always encour- aged people to contact them as soon as they fell into arrears. Together they looked for ways to reduce the payments or to extend the mortgage. However, they also tried to avoid allow- ing the debt to spiral upwards, which would make reposses- sion inevitable.",

   "text_content" : "THE GOVERNMENT has not decided whether to join further moves towards economic and monetary union within the European Community. But any British government would be appalled to find that the UK was unqualified to do so: at present, however, the UK is. More precisely, the UK should not wish to join the sort of Emu that would have it as a member. Current self-congratu- lation on the decline in infla- tion should be forgotten. The UK has not yet converged on the best European standard. The next year may offer the last chance to achieve that goal for many years. With the tabling of what the Dutch government labels a \"non-paper\", the debate on Emu has at last been seriously joined. It may be a \"non-pa- per\", but it does not raise non- issues. Its starting point is that if a new European money is to be as good as any existing money, then it can only be adopted by countries that have demonstrated their ability to live within the requisite disci- pline. Inflation should, say the Dutch, be close to levels achieved by the member state with the best performance; the fiscal position should be sus- tainable; the currency should have remained within the nar- row bands of the exchange rate mechanism for some years; and interest rates should be close together. Neither Italy nor the UK now meet those standards, to the public anguish at least of the former. An Emu on any other terms would be political adventurism and, as such, far more likely to undermine than to strengthen the European Community. Emu is, after all, intended to represent an irreversible com- mitment to a common eco- nomic and monetary policy. It is quite a different matter from the European Monetary Sys- tem, which has allowed room for a lot of of trial and error. Fiscal position The UK is near, and yet so far. Headline inflation was 4.7 per cent in the year to August, only a whisker higher than in Germany; interest rates in the UK, both long and short, are only about a percentage point higher than in Germany; the UK's fiscal position is better than Germany's; and sterling has settled down happily within what would be its nar- row band around its central rate. Since the move to Stage Three of Emu is not expected to occur before 1997, the ques- tion of the UK's convergence would seem to be decided. Appearances mislead. In so doing, they inevitably reinforce the current almost total con centration on the chances of imminent recovery. That con- centration itself indicates why full convergence will be so dif- ficult to achieve. People are far too inclined to believe convergence has been achieved when it has not. The more desperate will see the half a percentage point cut in the US discount rate, to the enticing level of 5 per cent, as an example for the UK, whose interest rates, despite the decline of the past year, are more than double that level. But the UK is not the US. It has tighter constraints and a different objective. Interest cuts in the UK have now gone almost as far as they can, and almost as far as they should. German standard One reason the UK's conver- gence looks so satisfactory is that Germany has experienced a shock that has driven up inflation and budget deficits to non-Germanic levels. It would be foolish to expect them to remain there. The Bundesbank remains determined to get inflation back to 2 per cent. The standard to be achieved, therefore, is not Germany now, but Germany as it once was and will almost certainly be once more. For the UK this means that unit cost inflation in the pro- duction of tradeable goods (principally manufactures) must fall to around zero. That is consistent with wage infla- tion of around 4 per cent. It may be delightful to see the underlying increase in average earnings down to 7% per cent once more. But the decline so far merely wipes out the infla- tionary impact of the Lawson boom. Wage inflation is still double what it needs to be. Getting wage inflation down to 4 per cent would be a nota- ble achievement. But even that might not be enough. Over the year to June, unit costs in manufacturing rose by almost 11 per cent, a loss in competi- tiveness that will have to be recouped. Furthermore, sus- tained growth will require sus- tained improvements in com- petitiveness. The present high rate of Ger- man inflation gives the UK a little extra time. But it is also only while unemployment is rising that the UK has any chance of achieving its goal. Pay settlements will need to have fallen to around 3 per cent by the time the rise in unemployment levels out, per- haps a year from now. The window of opportunity is small and will include an election. From time to time, therefore, stop praying for recovery. Remember, instead, where inflation needs to be if the UK is to have even the opportunity to drive in the fast lane of a two-speed Europe.",

During the last few days, British Aerospace's chief exec- utive, a relatively discreet pub- lic figure for the last 18 months, has been propelled on to the front stage with his com- pany's announcement that its pre-tax profits would nose-dive this year (to about Â£150m from Â£376m last year) and that the company would take a Â£250m exceptional charge for restruct- uring in the second half. His colleagues say he thrives on adversity. This week he has been given the chance to show it, especially as he has been made to take a higher profile now that Professor Sir Roland Smith, BAe's chairman, has decided to step back and adopt, in the professor's own words, \"an elder statesman\" role. Since the launch of its Â£432m rights issue this week and its far worse than expected sinan- cial results, BAe, one of the country's biggest manufactur- ing companies, has been engulfed in controversy and it shares have lost a quarter of their value in a single week. But in his shirt sleeves and with his bluff, plain speaking manner, Mr Evans seems to be taking the situation on the chin without appearing to lose any of his characteristic conn- dence or long-term optimism. \"The UK recession has been a hbell of a lot deeper and the rate of decline occurred quicker than we projected,\" he admits.

   "text_content" : "W-Trban regeneration on Tyne- S|side is \"settingan example * J that many other countries ^ ' within the European Com- munity are keen to follow,\" the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation said when its annual report was pub- lished last week. \"In Tyne and Wear,\" the report idded, \"we have cracked the problem.\" Within days of the report's publica- tion, rioting had spread across half a dozen Tyneside housing estates lying cheek by jowl with some of the corpo- ration's showcase projects. The New- castle area found itself undergoing disturbances similar to those which hit other UK cities such as Liverpool, Birmingham and London in 1981. Mr Alistair Balls, TWDC chief exec- utive, is putting a brave face on the events. The problem which had been cracked, he now says, was of finding a mechanism to consult and involve local communities in urban regenera- tion. But Mr Balls's gung-ho claims of a week ago are seen by some as further evidence of a disturbing tendency to talk up the region without attacking its underlying problems. The develop ment agencies are desperate to rad:- ate confidence about the region's economy and abolish the north/south divide. \"The hype is almost an act of faith,\" says Dr Fred Robinson, a researcher and lecturer in social pol- icy at Durham University. \"It stifles debate about the region's present con- dition and the options available.\" Those problems remain severe, and they translate into urban riots for exactly the same reasons which emerged from the analyses of the 1981 disorders. Chief among these is unemploy- ment, particularly among young peo- ple with no qualifications. In some Tyneside estates which have seen rioting this week, fewer than one in five adults is in employment. In most cases, they have no stake in society, and they have equally little hope of acquiring one. The consequence of unemployment, heightened by the breakdown of fam- ily structures and a crippling demoti- vation, is grinding poverty. A simple indicator of this is the almost total absence of cars on some estates, unthinkable even in the most deprived parts of the south of England. Glib generalisations about the revival of the Tyneside economy are often based on a flying visit to the splendidly restored Victorian centre of Newcastle, combined with an expe- dition to the modernistic MetroCentre shopping complex in Gateshead. But the housing estates which ring the city centre support a poverty-line life- style which would be familiar to read- ers of Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier. Certainly the recession has not yet hit the north of England to the extent Local authority leaders yester- day met Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to demand greater police resources in the wake of this week's inner-city distur- bances. The spate of lawlessness increases the likelihood of law and order becoming a general election issue. But what precisely is the issue? The causes and cures of the problem are complex - none of the councillors' leaders at yesterday's meeting believes that more police officers and tougher sentences offer the complete solution. Neither do their chief constables. Faced with a steadily rising crime rate - national figures published yesterday showed a record 18 per cent increase in recorded offences in the 12 months to June, 1991 - many senior police officers speak increas- ingly about the social causes of crime. Most crime is a youthful activity which culprits grow out of - almost half of known offenders are under 20. .:Â·~Â·' 'I*Â·'Â·Â·Â· Riot aftermath: polce patrol past a burned-out car used tor \"loyrlding\" in Nwcasue it has the south - but the region starts from a base of much higher unemployment. Well-publicised inward investment projects by Japa- nese companies such as Nissan and Komatsu have not compensated for the loss of jobs arising from the clo- sure of other plants. And even long-standing manufacturing compa- nies like Vickers no longer need droves of unskilled labourers. The contrast between the haves and the have-nots is accentuated by those parts of the local economy which are booming. The housing estates on the west of Newcastle, for example, look down on the development corpora- tion's Newcastle Business Park, where hardly any of the 800 jobs so far created have gone to local people. Poverty breeds idleness, relieved in many cases by petty crime, joyriding and worse. This week's riots can be seen as another stage in a rising tide of lawlessness which has already burnt out many buildings on the housing estates. Supermarket chains have long since given up the struggle against break-ins and vandalism. For the under-resourced police, these estates increasingly become no-go areas. The less law-abiding inhabitants begin to relish the battle of wits with the forces of law and order - Thursday night's distur- bances in Scotswood, a suburb of Newcastle's West End, were adver- tised on posters saying \"Scotchsy riot - 8pm tonight\". But police relations deteriorate even with upright citizens who feel abandoned and ignored by the forces of law and order, and even lumped into the general category of \"scum\" because of where they live. \"The police say we want you to tell us things, but they don't protect us if we do,\" according to one Meadow Well shopkeeper, who understandably wanted to remain anonymous. \"I told them about another shopkeeper who was a fence, but they didn't do any- thing.\" The final element of the cocktail is the \"copycat effect\", the undoubted influence on such events of media coverage. As in 1981, disturbances begin in one city and spread to another (often with different underly- ing causes). The youngsters on the streets are certainly aware of their media impact and the arrival of TV crews with their lights can act as a beacon for trouble. The thrill of notoriety - and of breaking glass, throwing half-bricks and setting fire to buildings -pro. vide an added element of \"fun\". Even some of those not actively partdilpat- ing see the entertainment value - like the residents, out on their door- steps, who videoed a blazing flat. These factors are present - in dif- ferent proportions - in each urban riot. It has been a peculiarly inchoate form of rebellion on Tyneside, in which the chief target of the rioters has been their own immediate envi- ronment. On the North Shields Meadow Well estate where the week's disturbances started, for example, only buildings on the estate were attacked. The com- munity centre, most of the few (mainly Asian-owned) shops, empty houses and the electricity sub-station were put to the torch. The aim was to lure the police on to the estate to wreak revenge for the death of two local joyriders - professional crimi- nals, some admirers insisted - in a high-speed chase. Rather better stocked shops on the owner-occupied housing estate across the road were not touched. On Thursday night, the riots in Scotswood targeted the local post office, where those on state benefits must cash their giro cheques. The police broke up the crowds before they could hit the other targets on their list, said to include a doctor's surgery, two schools and the local working men's club. Asian shopkeep- ers in the area believe that they will also be hit - even though they are the only people left serving the area. The rioters are mainly men and boys between 15 and 25, though some much younger children appear free to roam the streets at midnight. Dressed in the standard uniform of shell suit and trainers, they find it hard to explain why they attack local ameni- ties. \"It's just to get back at the police,\" said one teenager after the Meadow Well riot. \"We want to get the truth nut that the noliice killed those lads. The police are murderers.\" \"It's the police's fault - they should say sorry,\" said another. The depressing conclusion is that for this generation of rioters, it will be hard to see any escape from long-standing deprivation. For the next generation, the best hope lies in the inner-city initiatives which seek to regenerate estates by drawing together community groups, local business, council departments and government agencies. The aim of the initiatives is to per- suade those who live on the estates to develop a new vision for their future, and to have the confidence to work towards achievable targets. The riots will be a setback in that process, espe- cially if such painstaking efforts are elbowed out of the way by some quick fix which national politicians can latch on to. ing enthusiast for this idea, last year launched Volunteers, a scheme to involve young people in community activities. A Volunteers scheme based on a Newcastle estate is under consid- eration. Eileen Bowman, who is responsible for Volunteers in Sheffield and also manages the National Assaciation for the Care and Resettlement of Offend- ers' youth training in the city, would like to see the scheme enlarged. \"But one of the most essential elements of Volunteers is that it brings together young people from a range of social backgrounds. We have mixed young offenders from deprived backgrounds with successful graduates and they have gained from contact with each other.\" The question of how to give Britain's disadvantaged young people contact with a wider culture than the one found on their own depressed streets is, perhaps, one of the most fundamental questions raised by this week's disturbances.",

   "text_content" : "The peak ages of criminal activity are between 15 and 18 years for males and 15 for females. Remarkably, one- third of males will have collected at least one conviction for a relatively serious offence by the time they have reached the age of 31. This week's disturbances remain exceptional events. But burglary, vio- lence, drug offences, vandalism and crimes involving motor vehicles are commonplace in many deprived inner-city areas and estates. High crime rates contribute to a police response which, in spite of the efforts of many forces to adopt a more sensitive community-based style since the riots of the early 1980s, provokes frequent allegations of over-reaction and harassment. The Increased likelihood of young people in deprived inner-city areas and estates being tempted into crime is compounded by a range of other social problems including poor hous- ing, low levels of educational attain- ment and high unemployment The number of 18-19-year-olds without jobs rose from 131,000 in April, 1990, to 185,000 in April, 1991. Community workers tell of young people with too much time on their hands, living aimlessly lives which are increasingly isolated and alien- ated from \"mainstream\" society. Since many deprived areas are likely to suffer high unemployment for a long time to come, one possibility would be the greater use of commu- nity service schemes to motivate young people. Suggestions for compulsory com- munity service schemes have tradi- tionally been dismissed as akin to military conscription, but Mr David Piachand, the professor of social administration at the London School of Economics, argues in the Journal Political Quarterly that it is absurd for Britain to use community service as a penalty for criminal behaviour rather than on a wider basis. Involv- ing young people in community ser- vice could, he believes, \"act as a major integrative force in soci- ety\". The Prince of Wales, a long-stand-",

Your article \"Writing on the Wall\" (September 9) condemned MEPC for creating a white ele- phant. MEPC is not alone. UK developers have traditionally made multi-million-pound deci- sions on gut feelings and got away with it. The property industry must be unique in investing so much money on such little evidence. It is rare for developers to research the needs of their cus- tomers - a fundamental starting point in the develop ment of a new product for our supermarket shelves. Surely the responsibility upon them is so much greater, since monu mental buildings such as Alban Gate cannot be with- drawn when they go past their sell-by dates. Our planners should demand professional independent mar- ket research from developers, which clearly demonstrates a demand for the type and size of a property development prior to granting planning permis- sion.

Good advisers tend to give value for money with remuner- ation, either fee or commission based, being related to their time spent on the client's case.

   "text_content" : ".liT -he former senior Inde- * pendent journalist . rdaches for a literary analogy to describe the changes since Andreas Whit- tai Smith launched Britain's lirst new quality daily this cen- 'try on a wave of idealism. It was, he says, like Orwell's Ani- mal Farm where all the ani- mals started equal after they chased the hated humans away. But then the pigs began wearing clothes and sleeping in beds and thinking they were very special. Mr Whittam Smith and the other founders of The Indepen- dent have already secured a place in British newspaper his- tory for pulling off what was probably the most remarkable press launch this century. However, the applause and prizes have now faded, and the organisation is having to come of age in an exceptionally diffi- cult climate. It is proving a painful readjustment for all concerned. \"At the beginning Andreas was a journalist among jour- nalists and was very deliberate in talking to journalists and eating in the canteen. Almost all that has stopped now,\" says the journalist. Stephen Glover, one of the three Daily Telegraph conspir- ators who shared a dream and a bottle of whisky in Andreas Whittam Smith's kitchen in the summer of 1985 as they planned the new paper, puts it slightly differently. Since its launch in October 1986, The Independent had gradually become like other papers \"with politics, power centres, rules and conventions\". Mr Glover was foreign editor of The Independent and editor of the Independent on Sunday until he lost a power struggle in May and failed to stop the merger of the daily and the Sunday titles. He has signed up to write a book about the tribu- lations of The Independent - problems that led to his own resignation, though he remains a non-executive director. In recent weeks Andreas Whittam Smith has had little time to wonder whether The Independent has lost some of its initial idealism. He has faced more pressing problems. Last month Newspaper Pub- lishing, the company that owns The Independent, buffeted by the sharpest advertising reces- sion for broadsheet newspapers this century, announced a steep rise in losses for the six months to the end of March to Â£6.45m, although this included Â£1.9m for 56 redundancies. At the same time the paper launched a refinancing designed to raise more than Â£16m - Â£8.25m from a rights issue and Â£8m from a new loan facility. The rights issue - underwritten by Newspaper Publishing's two major share- holders, La Repubblica Interna- tional (which publishes La Repubblica in Italy) and Prom- otora de Informaciones, pub- lisher of El Pais in Spain - closed yesterday afternoon. The two continental Euro- pean publishers already hold 14.9 per cent each after the last Â£21.5m re-financing 10 months ago. If they had to take up all the new shares their stakes would rise to a total of just under 42 per cent. This is unlikely as some existing shareholders are subscribing. But the deal means that an extraordinary general meeting on Monday will vote on lifting current barriers in the com- pany's articles of association to any shareholder owning more than 15 per cent - the corner- stone of the paper's indepen- dence from established news- paper proprietors. Pessimists warn this could lead to an eventual takeover of the paper. The prospectus for the rights issue does carry an unambigu- ous health warning. It says the company's projections assume the beginning of an upturn this autumn with a general strengthening of the UK econ- omy throughout next year. The Independent is not counting on much real improvement in advertising revenue in the next 12 months. A further round of cost-cutting is being planned - although no journalistic redundancies - designed to save more than Â£2m a year. A wage freeze for staff is also likely until the Â·.- t recession is clearly over. Li \"We're like a destroyer g escorting an Atlantic convoy In . the war. We're battered, shot g up and the paint is peeling, but h we're close to port and all the guns are still working,\" says n Mr Whittam Smith, smiling r with contentment at the image e he has conjured up. Unless the recession takes a turn for the worse, he is proba- bly right. But whatever hap- pens structural changes are under way at the top with a de facto split of Mr Whittam Smith's dual role as chief exec- utive and editor likely. Some who know him well are critical of him as a man- ager. As a former financial journalist he is at home with numbers and budgets. \"But he'd far rather make speeches to conferences in Bogota or have lunch with Douglas Hurd (the UK foreign secretary) than squeeze more revenues out of the classified advertising department,\" said a, former Independent journalist. Yet because of his chief exec- utive duties Mr Whittam Smith too seldom does what even his critics acknowledge he does well - edit a national newspa- per. Instead the orchestra often plays by itself or under the baton of Mr Matthew Symonds, executive editor and the third of the Independent's founders. Despite some board disquiet Mr Whittam Smith is likely to keep the title of chief executive with a new managing director taking over much of the day-to-day management duties. No one could have forecast the full depth of the advertis- ing recession but most of Mr Whittam Smith's critics home in on the fact that he chose to launch a Sunday newspaper when he did: just as the gloom was gathering. The move turned a profitable company planning to float on the Stock Exchange into a loss-making enterprise dependent on new shareholders for survival. After all, the company had spurned a chance to enter the Sunday market earlier. The idea of launching a Sunday was mooted in October 1988 by Henry Porter, then editor of the Illustrated London News, and Stephen Fay, then editor of Business magazine, during a meeting with Mr Whittam Smith at London's Garrick Club. But nothing came of it. After a period of confusion the Independent on Sunday was launched against the Sun- day Correspondent in January 1990 and clearly contributed to the Correspondent's demise. In May this year, with Newspaper Publishing incurring heavy losses, the merger of the Sun- day and daily papers was pushed through over consider- able internal opposition. Mr Glover argued for contin- ued separation and for a drive to raise new money to see the Independent on Sunday through to profit. Mr Porter was involved with a group of journalists trying to find a new majority shareholder for the Sunday. There were talks with the Washington Post. Mr Whit- tam Smith and the board responded with an emphatic \"No\". Mr Whittam Smith is ada- mant it was important for the company to enter the Sunday market and is philosophical about the resulting difficulties. Since the merger the Indepen- dent on Sunday's circulation has been rising gently to around 400,000. The daily at around 380,000 is only 30,000 below its peak. The Independent was launched at a most propitious moment with advertising reve- nues rising and the powerful newspapers momentarily dis- tracted by \"the Fleet Street revolution\". With the less for- tuitous timing of the Sunday Mr Whittam Smith believes his luck was evened up. \"I have nothing to complain about. I've had some aces and I've had some twos. We haven't always had a handful of trumps but there will be some good cards,\" he says.",

   "text_content" : "avana, once the largest and most opulent town in the Caribbean, has gone sul- lenly quiet. There are few cars. Most supermarkets have been closed; the largest, Centro Commer- cio, is now a computer centre. The houses, which generally pre-date the revolution, are slowly crumb. ling. At street corners, people queue patiently for food. Cuba is an island adrift. This week the Soviet Union largely abandoned its former satellite by promising to withdraw 11,000 sol. diers, leaving only a much smaller training force, and to base trade on \"commercial interests\" alone. Cuba's recent overtures to Latin America have been largely ignored. The US, sensing the imminent fall of President Fidel Castro, is watch. ing closely. \"Every day,\" says a 56-year-old Cuban journalist \"the situation becomes more difficult\". Some things - such as cheese, ham, tele- visions or fridges - cannot be bought legally. Many rationed goods - such as soap - are avail- able only on the black market. The sense of malaise has affected Cuban officials. \"This is the worst situation in my 24 years at the cen- tral bank,\" says a vice-president, Mr Raul Amado Blanco. Officials freely admit that the economy is reeling from the col- lapse of Comecom trade. By some estimates, trade with eastern Europe excluding the Soviet Union - which used to represent about 15 per cent of total trade - has fallen by 90 per cent this year. Eastern European supplies of butter, buses, medicines, grains, and fertiliser have almost stopped. In all, total Cuban trade fell roughly 25 per cent in the first half of this year compared to the first half of 1990. Most Cubans are resigned to the worst, partly because the govern- ment has been preparing them for it since last year with a special austerity programme. A recent edi- torial in Granma, the Communist party newspaper, said bluntly: \"The difficulties which we will have to face could be much greater.\" Little by little, the range of goods available to most Cubans have been reduced. Earlier this year, eggs and bread were rationed for the first time. Last week, the government rationed vegetable oil; this week tobacco. The rations, the government says, are still sufficient to ensure no-one goes hungry. While some medicines are difficult to obtain, the level of medical care seems not to have fallen substantially. But, says Alberto, a young stu- dent sitting on the steps of Havana university, the people are growing tired. Cubans have to spend more and more time waiting in queues to ensure they obtain their allotted food. On 19th street in Miramar, a smart residential district in west Havana, the breadline starts at about 4.00am. At 10.00pm you still have to wait for a couple of hours to buy two small pizzas in a store behind a giant ice-cream parlour. Leyla, a doctor of philosophy and mother of a two-year-old girl, spends two hours every morning waiting in line to buy bread, and another hour waiting to buy milk. Every day she goes to the market to see if rice, oil or fish have arrived. Despite bleak prospects, Mr Cas- tro, trapped by the rhetoric of his revolution, has shown no inclina- tion to open the economy; none of the innovations that have invigo- rated the economy of that other Communist bastion, China, are envisaged. Dank of Cba officials say the government will not intro- duce a peasant's market In agricul- ture; nor will it privatise small businesses. \"How can you have pri- vate businesses when everything is rationed?\" one asked. Implausibly, Cuban officials believe the country will be bailed out by foreign Investment. The gov- ernment has suggested that rules restricting such investment will be bent where necessary. Grupe Sol, the Spanish hotel company, is spending $150m developing the beach at Veradero; the government claims the number of tourists com- ing to Cuba will rise from 340,000 last year to Im in 1995. The decline in Cuban living stan dards and state domination of sup ply already threatens the tourism sector. Some goods in tourist hotels - such as bread in the Hotel Victo- ria in Havana ($90 a night) - are unavailable. There is, too, resentment at what is a form of dollar apartheid. The .old pre-revolutionary nightclubs and bars - such as La Bodegulta, once a haunt of Ernest Hemingway - are again only open to those holding dollars. While living conditions deterio- rate, there is no sign of overt oppo- sition within Cuba. This year, for example, a record number of Cubans - about 100,000 - have volunteered to plant crops, as part of the government's unsuccessful drive to become food self-sufficient. The Pan-American games, held in Cuba last month, would have been the ideal moment to hold a protest. Yet they went by without a whisper of discontent. \"Castro,\" says a European diplo- mat, \"retains the admiration of the older generation and respect from the younger\". Those who do not respect him tend to leave for Miami. Often the same people who com- plain about falling living standards offer Castro their guarded support, if only for the sake of stability. A 58-year-old school teacher, in a typ- Castro: no signs of wanting to open up the economy ical response, says she wants him to stay: \"If tomorrow there was change, I don't know what would happen.\" Manuel, a 42-year-old television cameraman who complains bitterly about deteriorating transport, says: '\"deally, Fidel is the person who can make the changes.\" And if he does not want to? \"Then perhaps we should have someone else\". But Fidel Castro seems unwilling to change the system he created. In the past decade he has jettisoned (or imprisoned) many of his close advisers, and with his brother Raul looks isolated, both in Cuba and outside. Unless Fidel discovers new friends soon, the economic system he made will probably collapse from within. Cubans seem willing to wait.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Oliver Chastney. Sir, How right Gerald Avison is (Letters, August 27) in observing the desperate need for a change in our attitude to investment in R & D in this country. Not only to ensure the success of the relatively small R & D sector - important though this is - but to guaran- tee any faint chance of our manufacturing industry sur- viving much beyond the end of the century. Those of us engaged in research and development pro- jects for overseas manufactur- ers are only too aware of the critical advantages of this enlightened form of invest- ment, albeit long-term by UK standards. It is depressing enough to see Far Eastern, European and US industries pulling even further away from us year by year, but a glance in the rear-view mirror reveals a troubling number of emerging economies impatient to over- take. Fax service LETTERS nM b td on 07143 Ml 00r anouM ba c-re r typd and nue Generally, this lack of investment in UK Limited can be put down to \"short-ter- mism\" in the business commu- nity. I am wise enough not to expect a lead from govern- ment, but I think we should at least expect something more constructive than the even more acute outbreak of \"short- term-itis\" in those quarters. For example, in trying to become profitable, the Design Council is concentrating its efforts on just that. Their mas- ters, the DTI, have continued to become an even greater bureaucratic monolith as min- isters come and go with monot- onous regularity and such schemes as SMART and SPUR do precious little to boost either the resources or the morale of our industry.

   "text_content" : "By Roland Rudd BRENT WALKER yesterday gave Lonrho a deadline of mid- night on Tuesday to agree to a series of strict conditions for proceeding with its rescue pro- posals for the financially stricken leisure group. The move took the steering committee of its 47 banks by surprise. A senior member of the com- mittee yesterday said the com- pany has issued the ultimatum without seeking the approval of the banks, some of which had recently suggested that they might be willing to con- sider seriously the Lonrho pro- posals. In a confidential letter from Hill Samuel to Hambros Bank, Brent Walker told Lonrho that it would only consider its res- cue offer if it could provide the following guarantees in writ- ing: * The due diligence audit of the company would have to be completed within 48 hours. Lonrho recently agreed a con- dition set by the banks to con- duct a financial investigation within three weeks. * A loan facility would have to be provided by Lonrho dur- ing the due diligence exercise but it would have no standing against other Brent Walker creditors' claims. The interna- tional trading company origi- nally agreed to provide a bridg- ing loan while it conducted its financial investigation of the company. But it stipulated that its loans should rank above claims of all other creditors. * If the first two conditions are met, Lonrho would be expected to make an uncondi- tional offer for Brent Walker. A Lonrho director immedi- ately rejected the proposals. He feared that unless Brent Walker's banks intervened to water down the conditions the company would yet again by faced with liquidation. Brent Walker yesterday said that its needs were different to its banks. Its directors had to have firm written guarantees from Lonrho in order to decide whether it was lawful to con- tinue trading given the parlous financial condition. Hill Samuel is working on new proposals to offer Brent Walker's shareholders in the event of Lonrho rejecting the new conditions. The bank is hopeful that it can produce a formula which would offer bondholders greater security without the banks having to sacrifice too much value. However, several of the bondholders re-iterated their Tiny Rowland: strict conditions demanded opposition to any proposals linked to the banks' recon- struction plans, which were rejected earlier in the week. One bondholder yesterday said. \"There is no way that we are going to consider any new proposal linked to the banks reconstruction plan.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen, Investments Correspondent ADMINISTRATORS for British & Commonwealth Holdings have raised Â£474m from the sale of assets of the financial services group, and creditors may receive their first distribu- tion early next year. Mr Stephen Adamson, of Ernst & Young, administrator for the group, said in the half- yearly report to creditors that Â£63m has been raised in asset sales over the past six months and that disposals were con- tinuing. The report makes clear that while creditors will be receiv- ing a portion of their funds, there is no prospect of any returns to shareholders. Meanwhile, administrators are still considering a flotation of Exco, B&C's money-broking arm, in the absence of a suit- able third-party bid for what had been considered the group's most profitable divi- sion. Mr Adamson said: \"Exco is trading profitably,\" although its performance has been ham- pered by a recent slowdown in business. Exco's management has taken a number of steps to make the unit a more attrac- tive asset for flotation, includ- ing the agreement of a cross- broking arrangement with a German firm. SG Warburg is advising on the timing of the possible flota- tion. Creditors of British & Com- monwealth Merchant Bank can expect to receive a dividend of 43p in the pound in early Octo- ber, for a total return of Â£150m. Since the voluntary arrange- ment to realise its assets was agreed, liquid assets have risen while expenses have declined, making it likely that creditors will eventually be repaid the Â£330m they are owed. Separately, the administra- tors intend to pursue litigation against Quadrex Securities and Samuel Montagu, its adviser, at a hearing set to begin on April 28 1992. They are seeking Â£200m, less Â£20m-Â£30m a judge has ruled Quadrex can collect from B&C to compensate for non-fraudulent misrepresenta- tions during talks on the sale of its wholesale broking divi- sion. The administrators said they will seek to collect from both Quadrex and Montagu. \"We have to take a view as to who is more able to pay,\" said Mr Peter Phillips, legal adviser to the administrators. Thus far, B&C has paid its administrators Â£7m in fees and paid another Â£15m in accoun- tancy and legal fees.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Gourlay RAMAR Textiles, the troubled supplier to Marks and Spencer, has called in administrative receivers a day after sharehold- ers were due to have approved a financial restructuring. Grant Thornton, the receiv- ers called in by Ramar's banks, said the receivers had been negotiating \"with an interested party and a deal is said to be imminent.\" Mr Allan Griffiths of Grant Thornton, said that if the deal went through the 510 strong workforce would not be taken over by the purchaser. On Tuesday when Ramar's shares were suspended at 14p, the company said its poor financial position had caused production difficulties which meant it was unable to meet orders. As a result Samuel Montagu withdrew its underwriting for a rights issue and share plac- ing which would have given the company Â£6.4m of new funding. The placement would have been to Mr Richard Caring, a businessman with clothing industry interests including half of Together, a joint ven- ture with Otto-Versand, the German group. It would have lifted his interest in the' enlarged Ramar to 29.9 per cent.",

The fall was largely caused by an exceptional debit of Â£3.9m on restructuring the group. Despite this, the bank, which is mutually owned but has Â£60m of preference shares traded on the stock exchange, said yesterday that it was generally pleased with the result. Losses per share came to 0.4p per share (earnings O.lp). The bank said that it had raised its provisions against bad lending, but declined to give details.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Lapper EAGLE STAB, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, is to quit the pooled mortgage Insurance market This market allows mort- gage lders such as National ome loans Corporation and the Household Mortgage Cor- poration - which lack a retail network - to raise funds by securitising pools of their own loans for sale on the capital market. Eagle Star, which, together with Sun Alliance, controls about 80 per cent of the mar- ket, is to withdraw after pro- viding for claims of 220m. These claims, Incurred over a number of years, compare with annual premiums of about 210m and were fully provided for when Eagle Star announced interim pre-tax losses of Â£189m last month. The news could spark fur- ther worries about the mort- gage insurance market follow- ing disclosures during the last month of the extent of insur- ers' provisions against domes- tic mortgage indemnity claims (which insure lenders against losses arising from default of individual mortgages). Eagle Star itself is making provisions of Â£121m and this week Legal & General said it was to make provisions of Â£94m for claims. However, losses from pool policies are not expected to be as serious as those arising from domestic mortgage indemnity policies. Both domestic mortgage indemnity policies and pooled mortgage policies cover losses that arise when a lender is unable to recoup the full value of a mortgage after the sale of a repossessed property. Mortgage indemnity covers losses down to 70 per cent of the value of the mortgage. Losses arising when a lender is able to recoup less than 70 per cent of the value of a mort- gage from the sale of a repos- sessed property fall on the pool, which effectively pro- vides a form of catastrophe insurance. Within the pool arrangement the lender usu- ally carries a deductible, equivalent to 1 per cent of the value of the pooled mortgages. Eagle Star will retain an involvement in the domestic mortgage indemnity market although it will seek to increase premiums. Last year the group withdrew from the market for the insurance of commercial and residential development loans, announc- ing later that it was providing for losses of Â£200m on this business. Wills calls for Â£1.7m in refinance package Wills Group, the marketing services and automotive prod- ucts maker, has announced a rights issue and capital restructure. It is raising 21.7m through a 6-for-1 underwritten rights issue at 3.5p per share. Some Â£1.5m of the proceeds will be used to repay loans and the remainder to provide addi- tional working capital. The refinancing proposals also involve Wills' banks capi- talising the balance of their loans - Â£4.5m - into 2.4m new convertible redeemable Â£1 preference shares, a capital reduction to reduce the nomi- nal value of the shares and to cancel the share premium account and the reduction or elimination of the deficit on the profit and loss account. About 56m new A Ip shares will be issued, and up to 11.2m warrants on the basis of one for every five shares taken up. The warrants carry the right to subscribe for one new share at p between January 1 1992 and February 1 19 The shares closed 3p down atp9.",

   "text_content" : "A PART FROM clocking up three chairmen and three managing direc- tors in four years, remarkably little has changed about Molins' business,\" one of its large shareholders commented drily yesterday. Mr Michael Orr, since May the occupant of the top seat at the Milton Keynes-based preci- sion engineering group, knows he has a case to prove. On October 1 at an extraordinary general meeting, Molins will defend its independence for the fifth time in four years. Leucadia, the US manufac- turing and financial conglom- erate and 48.5 per cent share- holder in Molins, will try - for the second time since its May 1990 takeover bid was rejected - to seize board control by replacing three Molins direc- tors with six of its own. Molins' success depends on convincing shareholders that it has addressed the problems that lured the bidder: an erratic profits record, alleged neglect of new products, and a tempting pension fund surplus. Certainly on the first point Mr Orr can afford to sound relaxed. Pre-tax profit has risen by 72 per cent to Â£15.2m in 1990 since the 1988 slump and earnings have more than doubled to 36.9p (16.3p). The criticism of under-in- vestment in tobacco machinery manufacturing, the main engine of profits, is less straightforward. Mr Orr rejects the challenge that Molins' cigarette-making technology has advanced little since the early 1980s. He points to continued R&D spending of about Â£6m a year, 4 per cent of 1990's turnover. The latest development, the Passim 7000 Molirn Share price relative to the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index 130 120 110 100 90 80 SepI Suwm: Ddasloam maker of high-quality ciga- rettes, should start shipments within months. The second battlefield has been the pension surplus. Val- ued by Molins' actuaries at Â£85m, it is by any standards a hefty chunk of the present Â£108m stock market value. The emphasis Leucadia gave it in the March 1990 offer docu- ments has prompted City com- ments that the US company was primarily interested in Molins for its break-up value. But the value may not be quite what it seems. Molins is free to take a holiday from con- tributions to its pension scheme based on that Â£85m valuation. But the cash it could distribute back to the company is limited by the actu- arial definitions in the pen- sions legislation, and those indicate a much lower surplus of only Â£35m-Â£40m. It is, however, taking the steps to release that money, by constructing a new trust with the required powers. After 18 months under siege from Leucadia, this might seem an approach relaxed to the point of complacency - or exhaustion. Certainly those who think hostile bidders are a spur to sleepy management will hardly find Molins a text- book example. But continuity rather than revolution is the key to growth in a high-tech business, argues Mr Orr, and dramatic change would be inappropriate. He acknowledges too that the siege has brought its own strain. Defence costs alone have run to Â£2m-Â£3m and \"understandably customers worry, and it may have restricted our ability to recruit some key staff\". New in the job, Mr Orr is hardly going to add himself to that list. Indeed, he has impres- sive credentials though no manufacturing pedigree. Previ- ously head of investment bank- ing at Merrill Lynch Europe, he has also been a senior direc- tor of SG Warburg and group finance director of Grand Met- ropolitan, the food and drinks group. He will get a first answer on the future of his job on October 1. As shareholders rejected Leucadia's proposal last year to reshuffle directors, it would be surprising if they passed it this time. Not just because they have been wooed by Molins' improved profits, but because many have objected to Leucadia gaining control with- out making a full offer to shareholders. \"It is certainly within the let- ter of the Takeover Code, which governs takeover proce- dure on the London Stock Exchange, but it is inequita- ble,\" says one large share- holder. The shareholders are few but vocal - 25 own 50 per cent, with M&G the largest with 18.1 per cent - and a mere 500 shareholders holding the 1.5 per cent balance. The battle hardly ends in October. Even if Leucadia's proposals are rejected, it is still. allowed to buy a further 2 per cent a year, which could give it a 50.5 per cent majority share- holding next August. That seems inevitable, unless Molins issues more shares in the year and dilutes Leucadia's holding. Hence the significance, some feel, in Molins' own resolution at the October EGM to get share- holder permission to increase the share capital by about 27 per cent at its own discretion. Not an unusual proposal for an habitually acquisitive com- pany, but that has hardly been Molins' past style. That raises the question of whether Molins will finally be pushed into departing from its unruffled approach and into making a large acquisition - and whether its shareholders i will let it.",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Pearne Acsis Group, the continuity sales promotion, interior design and recruitment group, reported a loss before tax of 21.32m in the six months to June 30. Mr Neil Balfour, who took over as chairman following the resignation of Mr Darryl Phillips, who transformed Acsis into a marketing services company from the shell of a former jewellery retailer, said that the results were not comparable with the same period of 1990 when profits of Â£5.75m were made. In the first six months of 1991, the group had undergone a restructuring and refinanc- ing, \"necessary to ensure the continuation of the group\". Both the burden of debt and the future earn-out obligations needed to be \"significantly\" reduced. The media sales division and the US design business were sold, jobs were cut in the recruitment and interior design divisions, the board was reorganised and reduced in size and the head office has been relocated. Group turnover declined to 215.6m (Â£25.5m) though turn- over from continuing operations rose to Â£13.4m (Â£128m). Continuity sales pro- motion made operating losses of Â£222,000 (profits Â£58,000); interior design lost Â£154,000 (profits Â£343,000); and recruitment saw profits of Â£1.14m dissolve into losses of 25,000. An exceptional charge of Â£111,000 was the loss on foreign currency borrowings and inter- est payable jumped to Â£686,000 (Â£143,000). Below the line extraordinary costs of Â£26m related to clo- sures and disposals of subsid- iaries and businesses, restructuring and refinancing costs, and provisions for loans. Losses per share came to 0.7p (earnings 3p). The interim dividend is passed (0.4p).",

   "text_content" : "By Peggy Holli nger FILOFAX, the personal organiser group, reduced interim losses by more than 70 per cent to Â£613,000 as it con- tinued the drive to cut costs and revive its fortunes with lower-priced product ranges. Mr Robin Field, chief execu- tive, said Filofax - which was taken over by a consortium of investors in June - had begun to increase market share again, despite the recession. The loss compared with \"2.07m last time, which included Â£964,000 exceptional charges. Turnover fell from Â£4m to \"3.3m for the six months to June 30 as stricter distribution controls were implemented. In Japan, which once accounted for 18 per cent of sales, turn- over fell to almost nil as the group sought new distributors. Mr Field said he was aiming to have about 5 per cent to 10 per cent of sales there in the sec- ond half. The biggest gains were made in the US, where sales were 18 per cent higher than the previ- ous period. \"There is a tremen- dous amount of potential there,\" he said. Trading was depressed in the UK, where the market for per- sonal organisers was beginning to dry up. However, a new range of lower priced products, and the introduction of stu- dent-orientated organisers, was proving highly successful, he said. Losses per share were cut from 14.4p to 2.5p. However, if based on the average number of shares in issue, the loss would be between 3p and 4p. Again there will be no divi- dend. The group planned to change its year end from December 31 to March 31, and the current term will run for 15 months. This was to more evenly dis- tribute reported earnings, as sales were heavily geared towards Christmas, Mr Field said. It would also enable the interim statement to give a clearer view of second half prospects."

Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said the loan, plus strong season ticket and box sales, had reduced the com- pany's overdraft by \"quite a few million\" from the Â£10m- Â£llm it owed Midland Bank some months ago. The loan was at base rate whereas the bank added 2 per cent. Debt had been reduced in spite of the Â£2.2m purchase (partly deferred) of Scottish international Mr Gordon Durie. No money had yet been received for the injured Mr Paul Gascoigne. Negotiations were continuing with the Ital- ian club Lazio. Mr Sandy said a rights issue was still being looked at, but it could not be launched as quickly as had been hoped. Tottenham also announced the sale of its loss-making Syn- chro Systems computertised ticket sales business. Mr Paul Warsop, a director of Synchro, was buying it for Â£1, but virtu- ally all the associated Â£1.7m debt was staying with Tottenham and was included in the debt figure."

   "text_content" : "By Tim Coone in Dublin Mr Des O'Malley, Irish Minister for Industry and Com- merce, has appointed a special inspector to investigate the ownership of 14 companies linked to Greencore, the sugar and foods group. It is the first time the minis- ter has invoked such powers under the 1990 Companies Act. It is intended to divert mounting criticism of the gov- ernment's handling of the affair. The move follows two other investigations into Greencore and its subsidiaries, one at the behest of the company's board and the other about to be car- ried out under the auspices of the High Court. Greencore has been at the centre of a growing financial scandal since Mr Chris Comer- ford, its chief executive, resigned last week in connec- tion with a controversial share purchase deal. The purchase was made last year by four executives of Greencore, then known as Irish Sugar, and Mr Comerford, using a company loan to buy shares of an Irish Sugar subsid- iary. The shares were later bought by Greencore at almost four times the price reaping the executives a profit of more than Is7m. The government has been criticised for not having a rep- resentative on Greencore's board despite still having a 45 per cent stake since Irish Sugar's privatisation earlier this year."

Have you grasped the changes in pension legislation and their implications for your own needs? Are you getting maximum value from PEPs and BESs? Have you taken into account independent taxation for married couples introduced in 1990? Have you planned correctly to account for the increase in top rate CGTand the drop in top rate income tax? Looking at changes in pension legislation, taxation and the crash of '87, this invaluable book will guide you through the maze of the financial scene and show you how to get the most out of your money. You will benefit from information on: Investment Planning; Unit Trusts and Investment Trusts; Business Expansion Schemes; Personal Equity Plans; Pension Arrangements; Life Assurance; Tax Planning; Mortgages. Plus a chapter on the uses of Trusts and an extended section on Investment Timing - when best to buy and sell shares. With a self-diagnostic personal financial planning questionnaire and a Dying tidily log', this book contains everything you need to know in order to plan your finances clearly and profitably. INCLUDES BUDGET 1991 UPDATE.

   "article_dc_title" : "Two Cleveland Banks to Merge in $1.2bn Deal",
   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson in New York SOCIETY Corporation and Ameritrust, two large banks based in Cleveland, Ohio, are to merge in a $1.2bn deal which will create the largest bank in the state and the 24th biggest in the US, ranked by assets. The agreement, the latest in a consolidation wave sweeping through the US banking indus- try, follows a bidding war for Ameritrust, which has a trou- bled loan portfolio, involving three Ohio suitors - Society, Banc One and National City Corporation. Banec One, one of the fastest expanding and most admired US super-regional banks, apparently dropped out of the running earlier this week. Society, which is offering 0.65 of one of its shares for each Ameritrust share, has 350 banking offices in Ohio, Indi- ana and Michigan and a policy of expansion in the Great Lakes region. Its assets at the end of June totalled $15.4bn. Ameritrust, with assets of $10.7bn, has 212 branches in the same three states and a full-service trust operation. The combined bank will take Society's name, but the trust business will be called Ameri- trust. Mr Robert Gillespie, chair- man of Society, said consolida- tion of the two banks would involve one-time charges of $90m to $100m, but he anticipated achieving $130m in annual cost savings within a year of the deal going through. Mr Gillespie, addressing Wall Street concerns about the quality of Ameritrust's loan k portfolio, said an investigation by Society had found little of surprise in Ameritrust's cur- rent valuations. However, the bank might need to make addi- f tions to reserves of about a $100m to bring its ratios up to Society's levels. \"While there will be some e temporary deterioration in t Society's combined loan qual- i- ty ratios on completion of the merger, I am confident that problem loans have been iden- tified,\" he added. I The bid battle was set off if last May when National City e disclosed it had made an offer for Ameritrust worth $870m. a National has some 15 per cent g of retail deposits in the Cleve- land metropolitan area com- g pared with 16 per cent for e Ameritrust and 11 per cent for Society.",

   "text_content" : "By William Dawkins in Paris BSN, the leading French food group, has reported a 14.4 per cent rise in first-half net prof- its, reflecting a strong upturn in its dairy products division, and line with most analysts' expectations. Net profits rose from FFrl.5bn in the first six months of last year, to FFrl.72bn, ($299m) not includ- ing a FFrl.67bn exceptional gain from the sale of Pommery and Lanson, BSN's champagne brands, to LVMH, the drinks and luxury goods group. Group sales rose by 18.2 per cent from FFr27bn to FFr31.9bn, an underlying increase of 4.1 per cent at constant exchange rates and taking out account- ing changes. The underlying net profits rise comes down to around 8.5 per cent, after adjusting for the fact that BSN has consolidated its 50 per cent stake in Gal- bani, the Italy's leading pro- ducer of cheeses and salted meats, estimated Mr John Gra- ham, analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew. Operating profits rose from FFr2.87bn to FFr5.64bn, includ- ing the FFr2.14bn gross excep- tional gain from the cham- pagne sale. Within this, the operating profits of BSN's beer division plunged by 22.7 per cent to FFr425m, due to the impact on drinking habits of a cooler than average early sum- mer. Dairy products profits more than doubled to FFrlbn, partly due to the integration of Gal- bani, but also thanks to the good performance of other companies in the division, said BSN.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt MAN, the German engineering company, turned in a sharply higher profit in its financial year to end-June, with results from its truck and printing machinery divisions benefiting especially from German unifi- cation. The demand impetus from the new German states more than offset the effects of the poorer export climate, the Munich-based company said. Net profits would be at least DM400m ($228m), a rise of 22 per cent on the DM328m earned in 1989-90. MAN will increase its divi- dend further from DM11 to DM12. In the previous year, it lifted the payment by DM3 a share after earnings rose by 29 per cent to a level double that of three years previously, when it was still restructuring. The increased group profits contrast with the expectations expressed last November by Mr Klaus Gitte, the chief execu- tive. Then, he said profits were likely to show only slight growth. MAN said that trucks and printing equipment, its two main activities, had made a big contribution to the rise in prof- its. Diesel engine and indus- trial plant activities had also performed better. Turnover during the year rose by 16 per cent to DM19bn. The new order inflow was 13 per cent higher at DM20.7bn, with a 41 per cent leap in for- eign business to DM9.4bn con- trasting with a 3 per cent fall in domestic orders to DM11.2bn. MAN said the order backlog of DM18.4bn at end-June - a rise of 13 per cent - provided a solid basis for future profits; the foreign backlog surged by 54 per cent to DM6.3bn, more than half the domestic order volume which fell 1 per cent."

   "text_content" : "By Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen BANG & Olufsen Holding, the audio equipment and television manufacturing group, is to omit a dividend for 1990-91 after a DKrl35m ($20.7m) pre- tax loss against a DKr68m profit and 10 per cent dividend in the previous year. Demand was hit by the Gulf war and the general economic recession, especially in the UK, the US and Denmark. Sales were down from DKr2.28bn to DKr2.18bn. The loss after tax was DKr1OOm compared with a profit last year of DKr55m. The board emphasised that following a strategic alliance with Philips last year, when the Dutch electronics group invested DKr340m to buy 25 per cent of the operating com- pany, the financial situation remains good. A management reorganisa- tion and rationalisation pro- gramme is expected to produce significant results in 1992-93 but a return to modest profit in the current year was forecast by the board.",

   "text_content" : "By Martin Dickson US SHAREHOLDER rights activists yesterday claimed a major victory in their cam- paign to link executive pay more closely to corporate per- formance, announcing that ITT, the insurance-to-hotels conglomerate, had provision- ally agreed to substantial changes in the way it pays senior managers. Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, became a lightning- rod for complaints over execu- tive pay earlier this year, when shareholder groups objected to the size of his 1990 pay package. This was between $10m and $11.4m, a rise variously esti- mated at between 23 and 103 per cent, in a year when ITT's share value dropped by 18 per cent and profits rose only 4 per cent. ITT yesterday acknowledged that, following discussions with investors, it was plan- ning to put a new scheme of executive compensation before shareholders at next year's annual meeting. It declined to give details, but said that the scheme would create a closer linkage between executive incentives and increased shareholder value. However, it is understood that the plan, affecting the pay of around 500 senior managers, would involve both stock options and cash bonuses. ITT executives would not be able to cash in their stock options until the com- pany's share price had risen at least 25 per cent, or the options were due to expire. Cash bonuses would be linked to the company's return on equity, which is widely used as a benchmark of corpo- rate performance. ITT's changes will encour- age the activists to seek simi- lar changes at other large com- panies where they claim pay and performance are out of kilter. The United Shareholders Association, a prominent Washington-based investor rights group, said it was tak- ing ITT off its list of 50 compa- nies facing shareholder protest initiatives. Mr Ralph Whitworth, presi- dent of the group, said the planned changes \" will ensure that the irrational compensa- tion received by ITT's chief executive last year will not be repeated.\" ITT has consistently defended Mr Araskog's pack- age, saying that it re- flected his long term perfor- mVance ."

   "text_content" : "By Loulse Kehoh in San Francisco INTEL'S share price plummeted 12 per cent yester- day morning after the Silicon Valley semiconductor manu- facturer warned that third quarter earnings will be below expectations. In heavy selling, Intel was trading at $48%, down $6 from Thursday's close. For the past year, Intel's earnings have held up, in sharp contrast to those of other large US semiconductor manufacturers which have sus- fered the effects of the weak economy and turmoil in the personal computer industry. It now appears, however, that the recession has finally caught up with Intel. Intel warned yesterday, that weak demand and soft pricing in some sectors of its business are expected to depress revenues and net income below the expectations of the company and Wall Street analysts. Intel is a leading supplier of semiconductor chips to the per- sonal computer industry and its earnings disappointment is a gloomy indicator for the per- sonal computer market, which normally is strong in the fourth quarter. The chip maker said that its earnings will be dragged down by heavy price discounting in the market for EPROMs (eras- able programmable read only memories), standard memory devices that are commonly used in computer systems. Sales of Intel's own systems division, which manufactures personal computers and circuit boards, have slowed, the com- pany said. In contrast, Intel said that sales of its latest gen- eration of microprocessors, the devices that form the \"brains\" of personal computers, are expected to continue growing during the seasonally weak third quarter. \"The combination of sea- sonal weakness, a sluggish economy and a computer industry in rapid transition has produced poor results for commodity EPROMs, micro- controllers and PC platforms. August was slower than expec- ted, and September isn't show- ing any great upsurge,\" said Andrew Grove, Intel president. While demand for the latest versions of Intel's microproces- sors, the 386 and 486 chips used in high end personal comput- ers, continues to grow, Intel said that this increase was bal anced by a decline in orders for older versions of the 386, which Andrew Grove: August slower than expected are among Intel's higher vol- ume products. This reflects moves by per- sonal computer manufacturers to introduce new, higher per- formance models based upon Intel's 486 microchip and note- book computers using a new version of the 386 ,but also suggests continuing weakness in sales of \"mid-range\" per- sonal computers. The sales pattern may also reflect growing competition. For several years, Intel has held a virtual monopoly in the market for personal computer microprocessors, but recently \"clones\" of Intel's older 386 microprocessors chips have been introduced by Advanced Micro Devices, another Silicon Valley chip maker. Intel said that its operating income is expected to decline from the second quarter total of $180.9m. Favourable non-recurring items expected to total between $10m and $20m will boost third-quarter earnings per share above the 83 cents per share for the third quarter of 1990, but earnings are still expected to be below the approximately $1 per share estimates of financial analysts, Intel said. For 1990, Intel reported net income of $650.2m, up from $391m in 1989. The company's sales for last year were $3.92bn, up from $3.13bn in 1989."

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Kevin Brown in Sydney AUSTRALIAN Independent Newspapers (AIN), a consor- tium of leading Australian institutions, appeared to have lost ground yesterday in the race for control of the Fairfax media group after a govern- ment committee voted to relax the proposed rules on foreign ownership. Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Sinan- cial Review and (Melbourne) Age, was put into receivership by its banks in December after failing to meet interest pay- ments on A$1.3bn (US$1.02bn) debt acquired to finance a 1987 takeover by Mr Warwick Fair- fax, then 27. AIN, the only all-Australian bidder, has been favourite to acquire the group since attract- ing the support of most of Aus- tralia's biggest institutions, including the AMP Society and National Mutual Life. However, the consortium lost its best card after the rul- ing Labor Party's communica- tions committee said a pro- posed ceiling of 20 per cent on foreign ownership should apply only to voting shares. If ratified by the cabinet and parliamentary Labor party, the decision could resurrect rival bids by the Tourang consor- tium, led by Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Conrad Black, and the Australian Provincial Newspa- pers consortium, led by Mr Tony O'Reilly. Tourang is believed to have pressed for a 30 per cent ceiling on foreign voting shares, which would have allowed Mr Black's UK-based Daily Tele- graph group to take 20 per cent of Fairfax, with a further 10 per cent going to Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank. Mr Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, an Australian media company with television and magazine interests, would have taken 14.9 per cent, the limit under legislation control- ling cross-ownership of media assets. Mr O'Reilly, the Irish chair- man of Heinz, the US food group, is believed to have sought a 25 per cent interest for Independent Newspapers, his privately-owned Irish news- paper group. Australian Pro- vincial Newspapers is con- trolled by Mr O'Reilly through family interests. Both groups said they were considering whether to restruc- ture their bids to bring foreign ownership of voting shares into line with the revised gov- ernment proposals. Mr John Reynolds, Mr O'Reilly's candidate to be chairman of Fairfax, said the consortium saw \"no legislative problems with our bid\". Tour- ang said it was \"an option\" for Hellman and Friedman and holders of Fairfax junk bonds, who mainly support the bid, to take non-voting equity. However, Tourang could also face problems in complying with separate proposed legisla- tion intended to prevent com- panies exercising effective con- trol of media groups through \"associates\". Several Tourang executives have close links to Mr Packer. The principal effect of the committee's decision could be to increase the price for Fair- fax, since it will allow the con- sortia to raise as much finance as they wish from overseas sources. AIN officials were angered by reports that Mr Kim Beaz- ley, the communications min- ister, had told Labor MPs the consortium represented the anti-Labor \"Melbourne estab- lishment\". However, Mr Beaz- ley said claims that the deci- sion was intended to block AIN or favour other bidders were \"pretty bizarre\". The Cabinet and Labor cau- cus are expected to debate the recommendation in around three weeks. Mr Des Nicholl, the Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu accountant who is acting as receiver to Fairfax, is expected to receive detailed bids in the next few weeks.",

   "text_content" : "By Robert Gibbons in Montreal BRITISH Petroleum wants to sell all its Canadian mining assets, including the troubled Hope Brook gold operation in Newfoundland. BP Canada sold its down- stream oil and gas interests to Petro-Canada early last decade and has become solely an upstream producer with a min- eral division. But the mining assets, with a book value of C$200m, (US$175.4m) represents about one-quarter of the business. BP Canada owns 61 per cent of the Selbaie copper-zinc-gold producer in north-western Que- bec, in partnership with Billiton, and .a limestone mine in British Columbia. Both these operations are prof- itable. Hope Brook produced 110,000 ounces of gold in 1990 but BP Canada took a C$30m write-down on its investment. The mine has been shut down temporarily because bs envi- ronmental problems. The company sold a major British Columbia mining investment last year for a gain of C$73m. In the first half this year, the mining division lost C$17m. Overall, BP Canada lost C$15.8m on revenue of C$167m, compared with a profit of $3.5m on revenue of $195m a year earlier.",

   "text_content" : "THE FEDERAL Reserve eased its monetary stance again yes- terday, as US inflation fell in line with expectations and retail sales showed the steepest fall for seven months. August donsumer prices rose at an unchanged rate of 0.2 per cent, bringing the year-on-year inflation rate down to 3.8 from 4.4 per cent. Retail sales in August fell at a surprisingly steep rate of 0.7 per cent, reflecting weak demand for cars and' a wide variety of goods. The decline was much sharper than forecast and fol- lowed a rise of 0.5 per cent in July. This resulted in a cut in offi- cial US interest rates. It was also followed by a rally off the day's lows by the dollar, which is perhaps not as perverse as it seems. The US currency finished weaker on the day in Europe, but it bounced back above the DM1.6800 level against the D-Mark, after touching a low of DM1.6775. This recovery reflected speculation that the stuttering Improvement in US economic performance will now gather momentum and also indicated expectations that it is likely to be the last easing of monetary policy in the present cycle. The Fed cut its discount rate by '/ point to 5 per cent. This was folowed by a reduction to 8 from 8% per cent in some banks prime lending rates. In adding S3bn of temporary reserves to the New York banking system, via customer repurchase agreements, the Fed also appeared to cut its target Federal funds rate to 5% from 5'/ per cent. Fed funds were trading at 5% per cent at the time of the operation. At the London close the dol lar had eased to DM1.6840 from DM1.6855; to Y133.90 from Y134.05; to SFr1.4760 from SFr1.4770; and to FFr5.7350 from FFr5.7425. Its index fell to 64.8 from 65.0. Sterling was weaker overall as a sharp decline in the UK annual rate of inflation encour- aged speculation about another cut in UK bank base rates. Year-on-year inflation in August fell to 4.7 from 5.5 per cent. There was some disap- pointment that the figure was not as low as 4.5 per cent, but the market expects a further decline in the inflation rate and is looking for lower inter- est rates. The differential between UK and German rates has already narrowed sharply this year, making the pound less attrac- tive at a time when the politi- cal risk in holding the cur- rency appears to be increasing.

Three-month sterling inter- bank fell to 10%-10 from 10A 10% per cent, while 12-month money was quoted at 10*-96 against 10t-10 per cent.

Late assistance of around Â£130m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Â£913m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Â£490m and bank balances below target Â£110m.

   "text_content" : "By Trry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor THE LOWEST domestic inflation figure for more than three years plus a cut in US Federal discount rate proved insufficient to sustain confi- dence in the UK stock market yesterday After rising sharply at first, equities plunged in the afternoon and the equity account ended amid wild sug- gestions of impending corpo- rate, City and even interna- tional disasters. Seasoned traders appeared unperturbed, however, and claimed that much of the erratic course traced by the market yesterday could be ascribed 'to enthusiastic activ- ity by the marketmaking firms, many of which wanted to attract sellers rather than encourage buyers. Equities were influenced by heavy arbitraging between the Foot- S - --~~i'- ~-s so my V odm seoa 00p17 0011 sie futures and underlying stocks. Share prices were marked up sharply in the morning on the back of strong performances from Wall Street and Tokyo and in anticipation of the favourable UK Retail Price Index. At best, the FT-SE Index was up 16.1 at 2,658, within 22 points of the all-time closing high. The big institutions refused to play at these levels and prices drifted off the top even after confirmation that 1 . ear-onyear inflation In the UK had droped to 4.7 per cent I in August. 1 Government bonds came off their best levels on the infla- I tion news but soon edged up towards the day's best, closing I with gains of % or so at the longer end. But equities began to look unhappy as theUS ol lar and then Wall Street, which fell 20 Dow points in London i hours to abandon the 8,000 1 mark yet again, reacted nega Stively to US economic data and Sto the cut in Federal discount I and bank prime rates. The downturn in equities I turned into something close to a rout and by the close of trad- 1 ing, the FT-SE Index was a net 16.1 down at 2,625.8, a shade I above the day's low. Traders stressed that marketmakers i had vigorously marked prices down again In helatter pt of the aeion and that reta busi ness had been modest. Seaq volume increased to G60.7m shares, a return to lev. els last seen during the abor- tive Soviet coup, and compared with only 40.6m on Thunrsday. Over the two week equity account, the Footsie has lost 19.9 points, after suffering a setback early week when the market shied away in front of the Â£492m rights issue from British Aerospace. There were hints yesterday that Royal Insurance may be next in line for a large rights issue. Most equity strategists remained convinced that the August inflation figures leave the way open for a further half point reduction in UK base rates soon. 130C 125C S120C Turm 600 400 v 200 0 I Ba- ( Pefl< * Traidta volume remaebd ant*e this weik In the =e of the British Aerospace rights isM and the flow of profits statelsets.

   "text_content" : "A flurry of end-of-account speculation knocked Royal Insurance yesterday afternoon and prompted hefty turnover. The shares were only a few pence off initially, in sympathy with losses announced by Legal & General on Thursday. Later, hints circulated that the company had discussed with institutions the possibility of a cut in the final dividend. The shares tumbled and, at worst, were 24 off. They rallied to close 13 down at 370p with 4.9m traded. However, Royal denied the dividend tales which had, in any event, been disbelieved by most analysts of the sector. It was felt that traders might have started the talk in order to help square their books at the end of the account. Royal was also affected by pessimism from several secu- rity houses, notably Smith New Court. Smiths re-exam- ined the company's mortgage indemnity exposure in the light of L&G's results and knocked back its forecast for Royal's 1991 results by Â£50m to a Â£210m loss - at the bottom of a wide range of forecasts. For 1992, the house now estimates a loss of Â£40m against its previ- ous prediction of Â£7m profits. The shares were further upset by revived albeit largely discounted speculation of a rights issue. Racal \"stub\" busy The last day's trading in Racal Telecom - to be renamed Vodafone on Monday - was marked by heavy trad- ing in the Racal \"stub\". The stub represents what will be left of Racal Electronics next week after it has distributed its 80 per cent holding in Telecom to shareholders. Continuing vague talk that a bid might be launched for the new, smaller, Racal Electron- ics, which includes the Chubb security business, triggered its heaviest trading yet in the stub. Volume climbed to 45m, more than double the previous high. The price of the stub rose to 48p before the wider mar- ket's rapid retreat late in the day pushed it back to the over- night level of 45%p. There was good turnover in Electronics and Telecom, too, as traders jockeyed for position ahead of the full demerger. Holders of 100 Electronics shares will on Monday find themselves in possession of an additional 57 Vodafone shares. Traders and investors arbi- traged busily between all three securities. Racal Electronics added 2 at 233p while Racal Telecom climbed 6 to 332p. Respective turnovers were and 7.1m and 6.1m, well above average. t Vodafone will replace Racal I Electronics in the FT-SE 100 a from Monday. Securicor, which owns 40 per v cent of Vodafone's rival Cell- y net, also improved. The \"A\" y shares rose 14 to 449p while r. Security Services, 51 per cent e owned by Securicor, firmed 14 * to 363p. a Composite insurers were e weak as at least one securities t, house turned seller. General o Accident fell 17 to 547p and h Commercial Union lost 8 520p while Sun Alliance, held back e by a sizeable placing at 360p, a closed 9 off at 358p. y Willis Corroon was strong t after winning the account to .t place the insurance coverage of r oil company Texaco. This fol- it lowed the announcement on Wednesday that it had won the Phillips Petroleum contract. Strauss Turnbull was a buyer and the shares firmed 9 before settling 5 up at Slip. There seemed to be no stop- ping Glaxo in early trade. The shares climbed 24 while the London market was firm. But US investors took profits as trading in New York began. The shares ran back to 1364p, for a net decline of 4. Reuters bucked the trend with a gain of 16 to 907p. Traders said heavy US buying and a shortage of stock were responsible for the improvement. Turnover was a busy 1.4m. Lonrho slipped as the mar- ket waited for information on the company's possible take- over of Brent Walker. Lonrho eased 3 to 236p while Brent Walker edged 1% higher to 13p. Tesco was firm against a weaker market on optimism before its interim results on Tuesday. The shares closed a penny better at 282p. But Asda fell back 1%'/ to 102p as doubts began to emerge about whether a new chairman will be announced at the annual general meeting on Wednes- day. Kingfisher eased 7 to 573p on suggestions in the trade press that Quelle of Germany was not now interested in bidding for Littlewoods. The specula- tion in the market is that King- fisher is now left as the prime contender. Ratners moved ahead 3 to 136p on interest ahead of its interim results on Monday, while Marks and Spencer was lifted 2% to 286%p by a Con- federation of British Industry survey which said retail sales volumes was increasing. Optimism of the state of the UK holiday industry continued to push the shares in the few quoted companies in the area. Eurocamp rose 8 to 256p, a new high, while Airtours firmed 15 to 669p and Owners Abroad added 2 at 108p. Management consultancy Alexander Proudfoot climbed 6 to 423p after the company said it was finalising the acquisi- tion of the management con- sulting operations of the Swed- ish firm, Indevo AB. The proposed price is of SKrl23.5m (Â£11.8m). Rolls-Royce had another good day. Turnover reached 12m shares though lower than Thursday's total of 13m, as the shares rose 1% to 144p. British Aerospace eased another 5 to 416p, making a decline of 139p on the week. Traders said that there was some buying at lower levels. A trade of 1m at 420p was noted early in the session. Mr Nick Cunningham and Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull believe the worst is not yet over for the shares and \"there is further downside to come\". Kwikflt added 7 to 150p with UBS Phillips & Drew positive on the stock. The shares were higher earlier in the session on a false story that the broker had upgraded profit expecta- tions. British Steel edged forward to 123/p in brisk trade of 10m shares. Water stocks stayed firm against the general market trend supported by a positive note from S.G. Warburg. The biggest gains were recorded in Severn Trent, up 4 at 357p, Southern Water, 5 better at 345p, Wessex, 4 harder at 406p and Yorkshire, also up 4 to 414p. Mr Nigel Burton at the War- burg said \"dividends (from the water companies) will continue in line with expectations at the time of privatisation.\" BICC fell 13 to 432p after Mr David Cawthra resigned as chief exec- utive of its construction arm,",

   "text_content" : "THE FUTURES market's lead over the spot FT-SE 100 index all but collapsed late in yester- day's session after a disap- pointing performance on Wall Street and the end of the cur- rent stock exchange account combined to produce a jittery market, writes Jim McCallum. Part of the futures market's retreat was accounted for by technical factors. The end of the latest stock exchange account means that Septem- ber's fair value premium will fall to just 6 points from 12 on Monday to reflect the number of FT-SE stocks which go ex- dividend. September FT-SE 100 closed at 2,629, down 30 points on the day, while its premium shrank to just one point against 20 at the opening. The reduction in the pre- mium encouraged market makers to unwind share trades hedged in the futures market by selling shares and buying futures. With the stockmarket busier and more volatile, turnover on the options market picked up. Over 75 per cent of activity was in stock option calls, with many of the larger trades on the buy tack. Asda was the busiest option in an active two-way market. Larger trades included a buyer of 1,000 October 110 and 90 calls.",

   "text_content" : "Wal Street THE LONG-AWAITED dis- count rate cut failed to bring relief to the stock market yes- terday, as share prices fell sharply on computerised sell programs and concern about the outlook for'third quarter corporate profits, writes Pat- rick Harverson it New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.14 at 2,985.69. The more broadly based Standard & Poors 500 also 'lower lower, down 3.75 at 383.59. The Nas- daq composite of over-the- counter stocks ran into profit- taking after Thursday's big gains, falling 4.42 to 516.71. Vol- ume on the NYSE was heavier than in recent days at 170m shares. The Federal Reserve cut the discount rate from 5%/ per cent to 5 per cent and the Federal Funds rate from 5% per cent to 5% per cent, following a small- er-than-expected rise in August consumer prices of 0.2 per cent and a much bigger-than-fore- cast drop in retail sales of 0.7 per cent. After an initial modest gain in the wake of the rate cut, share prices fell back sharply as investors digested the bad retail sales news and contem- plated the difficult third-quar- ter season ahead. The declines were exacerbated by pro- gramme trades, which were carried out after selling of stock-index futures had out- paced the fall in the cash stock market. A turnround in bond yields inflicted further damage on equity market sentiment. After opening firmer on the rate cut, bond prices fell back sharply and yields rose. In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was down iA at 102A, yielding 7.934 per cent. Bank stocks drew little com- fort from the cut in interest rates. J.P. Morgan eased $% to $54% after Morgan Guaranty, its commercial banking side, cut its prime rate to 8 per cent. Another bank to announce a prime rate cut was First Inter- state, which fell $% to $30'/%. First Interstate ran into heavy selling on Thursday when it warned of a big quarterly loss because of badly performing real estate loans. Among other big banks, most of which cut their prime rates in the afternoon, Citicorp edged $%/ higher to $14%, Chemical slipped $% to $25%, BankAmerica gave up $% to $40% and Chase Manhattan fell $% to $19%. Pfizer continued to be trou- bled by allegations by a Food and Drug Administration task force that the company had tried to thwart FDA regulatory efforts and prolong the market- ing of a flawed heart valve. Pfizer disputes the allegations but its stock fell another $% to $63% on 3m shares. On the over-the-counter mar- ket, Intel plummeted $6% to $43 on turnover of almost 10m shares after the technology group warned that weak demand and soft pricing would push third quarter profits below the $1 a share predicted. Canada TORONTO stocks ended slightly lower in continued moderate trading. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index fell 16.45 to 3421.14, for a decline on the week of about 67 points. Volume slipped to 20.14m shares from yesterday's 22.26m shares and tradin value was C8219.9 m compared with C$252.8m. Losing issues were above winners by 2B9 to 232. Eleven of the 14 sub-groups ended lower, with the gold group showing the day's big- gest decline among the key groups, off 1.50 per cent on the index. Financial services, energy and industrial products ended somewhat lower, while mining and consumer products were steady. BP Canada said it is mulling the sale of its mining division, in order to focus on oil and gas exploration and production. The stock was unchanged at 13 in thin trading.",

   "text_content" : "THE WIDELY expected interest rate cut in the US raised hopes of a similar move in France, and the bourse closed at its best level of the year. However, Wall Street's weak response to the Fed's move pulled late-closing mar- kets off their day's highs, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS enjoyed widespread gains on hopes of a domestic interest rate cut, which pushed the bourse to a year's high. The CAC 40 rose 15.02 to 1,876.19, a gain of 0.8 per cent on the week. The previous 1991 high was on June 11.

Turnover was heavy at about FFr3.6bn, up from FFr2.6bn. The hopes of a French rate cut triggered demand in the financial sector.

The Nikkei average closed at the day's high of 23,134.43, up 604.23 or 2.7 per cent on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week, topping the 23,000 level for the first time since August 15.

The Topix index of all first section shares was up 38.26 at 1,786.84, and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 14.63 to 1,362.02. Worries about the special quotation, or September futures settlement, were erased, as arbitrageurs started buying at the opening. traders said that arbitrageurs and indi- viduals were active buyers, and foreigners were also seen to be trading heavily. But Mr Hiroyuki Maki at County NatWest said that domestic institutions remained on the sidelines. \"Institutional investors are wary because prices weakened following futures settlement days in June and March,\" he said. Share prices rose on index- linked buying in the morning. Sell orders amounted to an estimated 500m shares at the opening, as traders unwound their positions by buying back September futures and selling cash stocks. However, the sell orders were absorbed by arbi- trage between cash stocks and December futures. In the afternoon, a rally in the bond market, following a fall in short-term interest rates and speculation of a credit eas- ing in the US, encouraged fur- ther buying of equities. The yen firmed as traders sold the dollar on expectations of lower US interest rates. Investors bought Soviet-re- lated stocks on hopes of better ties with the USSR.

   "text_content" : "\" HE SWISS stock market is mesmerised by persis- Stently high domestic inflation and short-term inter- est rates. After a 23 per cent leap in the SBC general index between January and April the Swiss market has been in a prolonged phase of what it has become almost fatuous to describe as consolidation. Since July the SBC general index has moved within a nar- row band of 615-630 while the SMI index, which charts the progress of a dozen blue-chip stocks, has fluctuated between 1,650 and 1,760 since April. Yes- terday the indices closed at 625.9 and 1,718 respectively. Analysts have regularly fore- cast a market-stimulating eas- ing in interest rates, only to be frustrated by unexpectedly high monthly consumer price figures. Now, after the announcement that the annual inflation rate was still running at 6 per cent in August, many analysts fear that the stagna- tion in Swiss shares may last until the end of the year. Current lethargy is reflected in Zurich's daily volume, which has been consistently slack since the summer. On Wednesday, more than half the transactions were concentrated in five stocks, the three big chemical groups and the two biggest banks. In spite of the burst of activity earlier in the year, turnover in Zurich dur- ing the first eight months was 5.4 per cent lower than in the corresponding period last year. The climate was not improved by the publication this week of the annual review of the Swiss economy by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which forecast that disinflation would prove costly in terms of lost output and employment. Investors have largely ignored the favourable half- year reports from many big Swiss companies and banks. Analysts' forecasts that Swiss corporate earnings will increase by between 15 and 20 per cent this year, with further profit growth in store in 1992, have had little effect. Foreign investors, whose buying sparked a modest rally in the spring, are neutral on Swiss stocks, according to Mr Boris Bizzozero, analyst at Warl Jame Baer still i equit earn short Pr< Swisi convl sumc rates befoi mon rema the I rate ( the ( Augi 6.6 pÂ« iwi Indicc 102 100 98 96 94 92 90 88 Souro than hope; start Mr rese6 whicl annu cent said i be r; 0.5 pc he si for i rate cent Ba! repu1 not anal] that mome room est i will decia apprr woul Swisr Ho Warburg Soditic, while Mr James Stettler of Bank Julius Baer says Swiss investors are still not ready to take a risk on equities, as long as they can earn 7.5 to 8 per cent on short-term deposits. Prospects for a recovery in Swiss share prices depend on a convincing downtrend in con- sumer prices and interest rates. After an initial easing before the summer, the three- month Eurofranc rate has remained around 8 per cent for the last few weeks. The annual rate of increase of 6 per cent in the consumer price index for August, although down from 6.6 per cent in July, was higher Switzerland Indices rebased Inigdonrndi o jun iWi uep Souwc: Darteamrn than expected and dashed hopes that interest rates would start to move down soon. Mr Beat Philipp, head of research at Bank Vontobel, which had forecast a fall in the annual inflation rate to 4.2 per cent by December, yesterday said that the forecast needed to be raised by between 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points, although he still considered it possible for the three-month Eurofranc rate to decline to around 6 per cent by the end of the year. Bank Vontobel has a good reputation, but its optimism is not widely shared by other analysts. Its scenario assumes that the Swiss National Bank's monetary policy will provide room for a reduction in inter- est rates, and that the bank will stand by its governor's declaration that any structural appreciation in the D-Mark would not be allowed to affect Swiss rates. However, concern about I I I I I t C r L I r r L L I r r I 1 r 1 s r s t s I r t t developments in Germany, Switzerland's biggest trading partner, remains one of the principal negative factors in the outlook for Swiss equities. Mr Philipp believes that Swiss share prices could move when Swiss pension and insur- ance fund managers adjust their portfolios. A decline of 20 to 25 basis points in the three- month interest rate could be enough to prompt managers to shift towards bonds and equi- ties instead of rolling over their present short-term money market deposits, he argues. A substantial decline in the annual inflation rate this month might do the trick. The most marked impact of high interest rates has been on financial stocks. While the banks have been buttressed by this year's recovery in earn- ings and have performed more or less in line with the market, insurance shares have under- performed the market by between 8 and 10 per cent over the past three months. Some analysts believe that renewed talk that some insurance com- panies plan to open their regis- tered stock to foreigners may stimulate interest in the shares, but at the same time they advise against buying the insurers' non-voting stock. There have been flurries of interest in CS Holding, the par- ent of the Credit Suisse bank- ing group. Brokers say inves- tors are probably responding to CS Holding's news in May that it could issue up to 20 per cent of Credit Suisse stock over 18 months, but analysts are wor- ried about the effect on the market of a placement of up to SFr2.5bn ($1.7bn). Chemical and pharmaceuti- cal shares, particularly Roche and Ciba-Geigy, have per- formed best in recent weeks. They have been buoyed up by the appreciation of the dollar, which promises to swell their earnings this year and next. Nestld, the biggest stock on the market, is an enigma. Com- pared with its international rivals, the world's largest food group is undervalued, analysts say. But it seems that Nestld is not immune to the obsession with inflation and interest rates, which is likely to remain the pervading influence on the market in the next few weeks.",

   "paper_dcterms_spatial" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "By Hugh Camegy in Jerusalem MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, last night rejected President George Bush's insistence on delaying US loan guarantees for Soviet Jewish immigration, but stopped short of an all-out con- frontation with the US admin- istration. Returning from a visit to France to a country stunned by Mr Bush's threat to veto con- gressional approval of US guar- antees for $10bn (Â£5.9bn) in loans, Mr Shamir said little to defuse what might become the bitterest dispute between Israel and the US for years. Mr Bush wants to stop Con- gress ftrom debating the guar- antees until after a planned Middle East peace conference, because Arabs will viewsuch US aid for Israel as a means of financing Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. There were some signs that Mr Shamir did not relish an all-out fight with the US administration. Both he and Mr David Levy, his foreign minister, stressed that differ- ences over the loan guarantee issue would not affect Israel's commitment to the peace pro- cess. One senior aide to Mr Sha- mir said the prime minister UN chief hopeful on hostages.............. Page 3 autsy Bush squares up to Jewlsh lobby........Page 3 was looking to the arrival in Jerusalem on Monday of Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, to iron out the issue. The aide described President Bush's intervention as \"a red light for us\". \"It means we have to be more cautious. It means we have to be more aware of American concerns in the peace process,\" he said. Nevertheless, Mr Shamir last night reiterated his rejection of any linkage between the peace process and aid for what he called a \"humanitarian endea- vour of a grand scale\". He praised the army of Jew- ish lobbyists whose efforts to persuade Congress to give its early approval to the guaran- tees in defiance of the White House prompted President Bush's veto threat. Israel wants the guarantees to help it raise $10bn on US markets to fund the absorption of hun- dreds of thousands of Soviet immigrants. President Bush's statement on Thursday on the issue made a huge impact in Israel. Extreme right-wing members of Mr Shamir's government accused Mr Bush of siding unambiguously with Israel's Arab foes and called for a freeze in peace talks until the loan guarantees are granted. On the left, while deploring the linkage between immigration and the peace process, politi- cians said Mr Shamir had invited President Bush's reac- tion by consistently defying him on issues such as the gov- ernment's refusal to halt Jew- ish settlement in the occupied territories.",

   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Belgrade and Ronald van de Krol in The Hague EUROPEAN Community monitors who have been attempting to impose a cease- fire in Yugoslavia said yester- day that their first mission in Croatia had failed. The bleak assessment by EC officials coincided with a push by Serb paramilitary units to extend their area of control to the Adriatic sea, thus poten- tially denying Croatia easy access to its own coastline. Croatian state radio reported that Serbs units, supported by the Yugoslav federal army, were now in control of a third of the republic, and Mr Stipe Mesic, the Yugoslav president and a Croat, appealed to the United Nations to intervene. Mr David Millar, a British diplomat who is part of the five-member EC observer team in Croatia, said: \"We have not achieved our primary goal, which was to establish a last- ing ceasefire in the region.\" Foiled: a Yugoslav army soldier arrests a Croat who allegedly tried to mine the army barracks in Vukovar in Croatia He said a new team of observers was due to arrive yesterday, confirming the EC's desire to try to play a construc- tive role in the Yugoslav crisis. In The Hague, Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, said EC monitors should be sent to the central republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina in case growing tension between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems, led to violence. He added that EC monitors had been sent to Croatia only after violence had begun in the republic, making it difficult to get monitors in place to investigate ceasefire violations. Lord Carrington, the chair- man of The Hague peace con- ference on Yugoslavia, will travel to Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, on Mon- day to meet the country's lead- ers and the army. In the latest attack on Osi- jek, eastern Croatia, one civil- ian was killed and 13 wounded when more than 200 mortars fell on the city. Mr Ivan Vekic, Croatian inte- rior minister, said 12 soldiers were killed and 13 wounded after Croats had lost control of the city of Kostainica."

   "text_content" : "By James Buxton and David White TWO Scottish-based sub- sidiaries of GEC-Marconi announced a total of 1,450 redundancies yesterday, blam- ing the British and worldwide downturn in defence spending. Cuts at the group's Yarrow shipyard had been expected, but the decision to shed 800 jobs at GEC Ferranti Defence Systems came as a surprise. The measures point to an accelerating trend in arms industry reductions as the full impact of the Ministry of Defence's Options for Change review becomes clearer. Trade union estimates already put the number of jobs lost among primary suppliers of defence equipment at more than 35,000 in the past year. This figure is expected to be multiplied by the impact on sub-contractors. The 800 job losses at GEC Ferranti, out of a total work- force of 6,000, follow three smaller waves of redundancies since GEC bought the Edin- burgh-based radar and elec- tronics division from Ferranti International early last year. Most of the cuts are in Scot- land, but plants at Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, and at Borehamwood in Hert- fordshire, are also affected. Mr Ron Dunn, managing director, said the fall-off in the company's business with the MoD in the past six months had been \"greater than even we had been led to believe\". He added: \"More and more decisions are driven by budget considerations which means making do with less competent products.\" The early retire- ment of RAF Phantom and Buccaneer aircraft had taken work away from the company. Yarrow is to cut its 3,500- strong workforce on its Glas- gow warship yard by 650. Sir Robert Easton, managing director, said it needed to win the contract for the next batch of Royal Navy Type 23 frigates. Yarrow's current orders should be finished by 1993. Yesterday's cuts followed warnings earlier this week of further rationalisation at Brit- ish Aerospace and Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine manufacturer. Rolls-Royce may shed up to 4,000 more jobs next year in addition to a current pro- gramme affecting 7,000 employ- ees. At BAe, cuts involve mor- than 7,000 jobs.",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Evans LOCAL COUNCILS in England and Wales could soon face a cash crisis after the disclosure yesterday that community charge collection rates are run- ning well behind last year's and that poll tax debts are above Â£1.5bn. Receipts from the poll tax in the three months to end-June - the first quarter of the financial year - averaged 12 per cent of annual charge income budgeted by local authorities. This compared with 21 per cent in the first quarter of 1990-91. On average, 67 per cent of chargepayers had made a pay- ment against 77 per cent the previous year, according to fig- ures published by the Depart- ment of the Environment. The government blamed the back- log on the surprise Â£140 cut in poll tax levels announced in the budget, which delayed the start of collection. Labour party leaders said the figures demonstrated the poll tax was becoming increas- ingly difficult to collect. If non-payment continues at similar levels, poll tax bills for 1992-98 - which could be set shortly before a general elec- tlon - might be inflated by up to Â£200 a head in order to make up the arrears. This would scupper the government's chances of limiting poll tax increases to 4 per cent and the tax would again become a political embarrssment Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: \"Poll tax debt now amounts to over Â£1.5bn and this will inevitably feed through to higher bills in 1992...the poll tax nightmare is far fhom over and the gov- erament's delay in abolishing the tax only adds to the prob- mag a ftinift usosmumts, Pft 4"

   "text_content" : "Perhaps it would have been better for shares if the Federal Reserve had raised the dis- count rate instead of cutting it. That would have deprived Wall Street of an excuse to turn lower on the grounds that recovery was shown to be weak, a gloomy view which quickly spread to London yes- terday afternoon. Of course, the UK market does not have to follow the US slavishly. Wall Street looks overbought, whereas UK equi- ties still offer some yield attraction compared with gilts. But the US move is not entirely encouraging for the UK nonetheless. First, it is a reminder that companies with exposure to the US do not yet have that much to reap from recovery there. Second, the weakness of the dollar as the Fed cut was discounted over the past week has left sterling caught in the backwash of a shift of funds into the D-Mark. This comes on top of election uncertainty, which has reduced the attraction to inter- national investors of holding sterling at a time when UK interest rates are anyway close to those of Germany. Sterling thus looks distinctly less com- sortable within the Exchange Rate Mechanism than it was a week ago. That is not yet ground to undermine expecta- tions of a further rate cut in a few weeks' time, but it helps explain why the equity market is still reluctant to move ahead. It had already dis- counted a slightly larger fall in inflation than that announced yesterday. What it really needs now is some solid evidence of recovery feeding through to earnings of cyclical stocks. Instead it has unfortunately been treated this week to an overdose of bad news from the likes of British Aerospace. Racal twins After three years of partial separation, the Racal twins were last night finally rent asunder. Since last November's demerger announcement, the market has been forced to take a view on what is left of Elec- tronics after its 80 per cent stake in Telecom is removed. Judging by the performance of Electronics' shares, Sir Ernest Harrison's plan to release value for his shareholders has been a resounding success. The question is what happens to both businesses now. Helped perhaps by \"penny share\" appeal and a little brand mania, the value of Elec- tronics' residual businesses has been steadily rising. At one point yesterday, the so-called FT-SE Index: 2,625.8 (-16.1) Racal Electronics Share price relative to the FT~A All-Share Index 180 160 140 120 100 1988 89 90 91 Source: Datatam stub was trading on a dizzy prospective multiple of 19. Electronics can be character- ised as a diversified electronics group with a poor profits record and Â£650m of net assets. The market might really believe a takeover is likely, but it all looks a little frothy. By contrast, Telecom shares have underperformed the mar- ket by a fifth since final details of the demerger were announced in June. Admit- tedly the astonishing Vodafone earnings record has stalled somewhat; growth might be in the order of 10 per cent this year and half as much again the year after. But it has no borrowings, is heavily geared to economic recovery and is about to start generating large amounts of cash. Assuming the sudden expansion of its free equity does not lead to an ava- lanche of selling, Vodafone shares are unlikely to fall much below their current level. Latin bonds With yields on US govern- ment bonds now falling below 8 per cent, it is not surprising that international investors have been casting around for better returns. They have found them on offer in growing volume from a rather surpris- ing source, Latin America, which has been working its way back to acceptance by the Eurobond market for the past year now. The problem is that Euro- bond issue managers have always been too fond of a good thing. The latest Mexican issue this week from Pemex offered a premium of barely 21V per- centage points over US Trea- sury issues, which is a bit miserly even for a country which has made astonishing progress with economic adjust- ment. Argentina's debut issue this week offered a juicier return. But, like Brazil, whose Petrobras oil company is plan- ning another issue shortly, its government finances are scarcely under control. Nor is it in good standing with its commercial bank creditors. The big Latin American bor- rowers have a special distinc- tion in that none defaulted on their international bonds while they were in trouble with the ,banks in the 1980s. The prob- lem is that the more bonds they issue in the 1990s, the less special they will start to look. UK accounting The recent storm over BTR's treatment of the Pretty Polly proceeds was a reminder that the issue of conglomerate accounting is far from dead. Judging by a provocative note this week from stockbroker Hoare Govett, the focus may soon switch to Trafalgar House. Hoare has come up with the striking conclusion that the company's declared pre-tax profits in the year to end September could be any- where between Â£25m and Â£120m. Three main accounting vari- ables are identified. The first is whether Trafalgar will equity account its share of the likely loss at Brel, or whether the damage will be restricted to a balance sheet write down. The second relates to residential housing and the likelihood that the company will reverse its controversial policy of capital- ising interest. The effect would be a partial write down in the value of the landbank through reserves, rather than as an exceptional item above the line. The third is the reclassifi- cation of Â£100m of commercial property sites, previously held as current assets, as fixed assets. That would avoid another profit and loss write down (estimated by the bro- kers at Â£50m) at the current year end. Mischievously, Hoare also suggests that Trafalgar could take a leaf out of BTR's book and put its loss from sell- ing cargo ships to P&O above the line (rather than as an extraordinary item). In Trafalgar's defence, there is as yet no knowing what the Brel result may be - if recov- ery claims against British Rail are allowed, it could be in profit. The new treatment of commercial property is per- fectly transparent and the probable ending of capitalised interest would be a response to investor criticism. The point is that shareholders should keep a close eye on earnings quality even in bull markets.",

   "text_content" : "HERE WAS a silence and a stillness, and then came the slow rum- blings from the great Himalayan ice cliffs. All around the triggers had been pulled. Avalanches of ice, rock and snow began racing each other to the glacier. The ice smashed itself into minute glittering particles that bil- lowed like clouds. The British Geo- logical Survey in Edinburgh recorded the earthquake of July 14 at 6.6 on the Richter Scale. \"Quite a big one,\" said Mr Turbitt in the seismology department. The next day we set off to climb the mountain the Germans call Nanga Parbat, carrying with us lit- tle more than a rucksack. In the \"Golden Age\" of Himala- yan mountaineering, when the Brit- ish were besieging Everest, the French Annapurna and the Italians K2, Germany was engaged in a costly battle with the \"Naked Moun- tain\", the translation of its Sanskrit name. Between 1932 and 1950 19 people died in five attempts on Nanga Parbat. The first successful ascent was made in 1953 by a lone Austrian, Herman Buhl. Since then, Nanga Parbat had remained one of the 14 peaks of more than 8,000 metres (26,248 ft) that had not been climbed by Britons. We had camped at its foot for three weeks, watching the 8,125 metre (26,660 ft) mountain, observ- ing its rhythms, the patterns of its weather, the winds that stripped the snow from its summit. It was only now, as our departure for the mountain drew near, that we began to comprehend its enormity, rearing more than 13,000 ft above our tents pitched in pastures on the banks of the Diamir Glacier. The size of the face that Dave Walsh, a 47-year-old mountain guide from Betws-y-coed, and I intended to climb in one quick dash was awe inspiring. We had come to Kohis- tan, this \"land of the ungovernable\" in north Pakistan, to climb Nanga Parbat, not with a great logistic machine but with the limited capa- bilities of our two selves. Traditionally, large teams of climbers have laid siege to the world's great mountains. They would, over several months, build up a pyramid of supplies and stretch thousands of feet of rope between a succession of fixed camps to set up a final dash to the summit. But we were to climb \"Alpine style\" - simply packing a rucksack with food and equipment and setting off with a friend for the summit. Except, if the proud spire of the Alpine Matterhorn were placed beside the great wall of Nanga Par- bat, it would reach merely a quarter of the way up. When we arrived at base camp on June 27, two Korean expeditions were hard at work, vying for the title of \"First Korean\". For five weeks a score of climbers had been carrying mountains of rope, rice and seaweed up the first couloir to a camp at 17,000 ft. Their progress had reached an impasse and there were rumours of strife in the team. Our involvement with the moun- tain was to be more intimate, shared between Dave and myself. As we sat at the bottom of one of the world's biggest precipices, waiting for the slow process of accli- matisation to take its course, it was Â·CCI-~Â· ~r c ~r Ic -crr,~;s~~P~S, ''~ ~~\"Y'i\" *Â· Rs;t; Â·Â·.Â· .._-Â·llÂ·c~Â·iruurl ,~YII~Â·L 'JU YL~Â·Â· difficult to remain confident. We set off a little after first light on July 16. We had six days' food rations, the clothes we stood up in plus a down filled Jacket and equip ment pared to a minimum: three pitons for rock and four for ice, two ropes, a small tent, sleeping bags and a camping stove with three gas cylinders. Our rucksacks still weighed more than 601b. We passed the Korean high point on the morning of our second day. Their camp, nestling under the prc tection of a rock, was strewn with their litter and all around, protrud- ing from the snow, was the debris of previous expeditions. No one in the end has the energy to remove the camps that cost so much to install and so they remain to be torn and scattered by the wind, a vulgar record of mountaineering ambition. Our days began in the dark and by first light we had eaten a meagre breakfast of oatmeal biscuit and milkless tea sweetened with Kendal mint cake, had packed our tent and were away. We intended to finish before the sun's intense heat brought a consuming lethargy and turned the hard snow to slush. At first our progress was slow and the way more difficult. The sun always seemed to arrive before our daily objective and we would reach the chosen spot boiled and exhausted. Then we would spend an hour, sometimes two, using our last remnant of energy hacking at the ice to build a platform for our tent. I had never been on a mountain where a place to sleep was so hard to win. Often the tent would be perched in the most spectacular positions, anchored with the rope to our two ice screws, its outer edge cantilevered out over thousands of feet of space. We would alternate the honour of the outer berth. In the early evening we would watch the cumulus boil around us and then disperse as the heat faded and the valleys slid into darkness. At the end of the day I would talk on the ICOM radio to my wife Gha- zala, invisible at base camp beside the the bright red tent that we could just discern. She would tell us of the snail-slow progress of two dots as small as punctuation on a vast white page. ()n day three we climbed through a snow storm, enveloped in cloud, pitch after pitch of ice as steep as the roof of a church. Crampon points skidded and axes flayed as the lactic acid burned into calf muscles under the weight of our packs. On day four, climbing simulta- neously but still joined by our thin rope, we made a long sickle-shaped traverse which brought us to easier ground. We were on the broad back of the Bazhin glacier that hangs around the neck of the trapezoid fortress that forms the summit. Some 20,000 ft below the River Indus flowed in its deep gorge. Down there the temperature was above 1001F (37.8'C). Here the sun was without power, the snow sur- face shaped by the wind into waves. By the evening of our fifth day we had reached the base of the summit trapezoid at an altitude of 23,600 ft. Sleep was difficult, appetite had gone and we needed will power to drink enough to prevent dehydra- tion and to eat enough to provide energy for the morrow. In the morning we would make our one-shot attempt to climb the last 3,000 ft to the summit - almost double the height we had managed on our best day lower down the mountain. In the last 1,000 ft we would be entering what is melodra- matically, but accurately, called the \"death zone\". At these rarefied alti- tudes man can survive at best for a few days, judgment is often impaired and hallucinations com- mon, lung or brain haemorrhages are a real threat. At 2 am, as we began melting snow on our Gas stove, a few stars showed through the cloud. It was after 4 am when we creaked into action, and by then it was snowing and we were enveloped in cloud. We discussed the wisdom of making the attempt, but we were at the end of our food, and even if we did delay the weather might even worsen. Carrying no more than one might on a winter walk in Snowdonia - a half full flask of water, a bar of chocolate, some glucose tablets, a bivouac bag, a down jacket and a camera - we climbed through knee-deep snow with the weather worsening and a heavy weight of pessimism adding to the gloom. I made a pact with Dave that we would continue until 9 am but I felt that he thought conditions were too bad to go on. The hour came and went without improvement. By 10 am I was resigned to failure and waiting for him to end the stupid- ity, but he was game as long as I was. In spite of the conditions we were making reasonable progress - if climbing upwards into a storm at 26,000 ft could be described as rea- sonable. I am not now so sure. We resolved to continue for as long as we felt strong and in con- trol. Then, at noon, the smoke swept aside and we emerged above the clouds into a world of hard sun- light and deep blue sky, golden rock and glittering snows. A cold wind blew spindrift from the summit ridge 1,300 ft above us. We agreed to keep going until 5 pm when, summit or not, we had to return if we were to avoid a biv- ouac. Both of us were confident we could survive a night in the open, but not without the inevitable frost- bite; whether we would be able to get down the mountain in a maimed condition was another matter. We continued the slow upward progress, with ice axe and ski-stick, taking turns to break a zigzag trail through snow with a hard surface crust. Sometimes it supported a cramponed boot but more often we plunged through to our knees. The impossibility of maintaining a rhythm was debilitating. We reached the summit at 4.15 pm on Sunday July 21 after six days. We were the first Britons to climb Nanga Parbat, 96 years after the first attempt by a British expe- dition and 38 years since Buhl's lonely success. To our left was the North Ridge up which Buhl crawled, snaking down into the cloud in a suc- cession of rocky sum- mits. Under our feet the Rupal Face, the greatest mountain wall in the world, plunged into fathomless shadow. It would have been good to linger, to soak up that beautiful, enchanted place in the golden light of evening and watch the sun sink into the sea of boiling cloud that flowed, in an interminable current, out of Asia and washed upon this mountain island, the westernmost bastion of the Himalayas. We had to descend. Down the snowy couloir, out of the brilliant crystal world and into cloud. There in the whiteness it had continued to snow. Our tracks were gone. But we had to find our tent before dark. In a little more than two hours in the grey half light that precedes darkness, the altimeter led us unerringly to the place. I collapsed, unable to summon another flicker of energy. Dave made tea. The Koreans had just arrived at the platform that had been our third camp, when we descended from the cloud. \"Leader say con- gratulation, and please to use our ropes to go down\", we were told. We continued our descent and, exhausted, hacked a platform a few feet below the Korean Camp Two. It was our most comfortable night. In the morning I took the Koreans the remains of our food: pumpernickel neither of us could bear to eat, some chocolate bars and drinks. They were simmering a vast bowl of rice and vegetables. \"Later\", they said, \"we speak leader, he say we go down or rest here\". We left them to eat what looked like more food than we had eaten in a week and continued our descent back to life. * The British Nanga Parbat Expedi- tion was sponsored by ICOM, Karri- mor and Camping Gaz UK. The climb was in support of the Royal Marsden Cancer Appeal",

Watson, M.D. IT WAS scarcely after breakfast on a misty morning in September '91 when our landlady, Mrs Hudson, ushered a small, blonde woman into the quarters which at that time I shared with my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street. The visitor provided us with an excellent excuse to turn off the break- fast TV programme, which as usual was dominated by economists talking about the end of the recession. \"Pray forgive my intrusion so early, Mr Holmes,\" she said, introducing her- self as Mrs St Clair. \"But I am overcome with anxiety for the safety of my hus- band Neville.

   "text_content" : "British Aerospace's shares peaked, in July 1989, coincides to the day with the announcement of its decision to buy Arlington Securities, one of the most suc- cessful property developers of the 1980s. Since then, it has been down- wards almost all the way in both absolute and - as the chart shows - relative terms. Â£1,000 invested in British Aero- space shares on the day it bought Arlington would today be worth only Â£568; after allow- ing for inflation, their value has dropped by 51 per cent. British Aerospace's prob- lems, which led it to a singu- larly badly received Â£432m rights issue on Wednesday, are not confined to property. Rover, the cars subsidiary, is back in the red; the defence business acquired with Royal Ordnance is undergoing a long-term squeeze; the com- pany has decided to drop any pretensions to building civil aircraft by itself. But it had been hoping to use profits from property to offset the costs of restructuring its other operations; and the lack of them was glaringly exposed by its Â£250m exceptional provi- sion. There is a wider moral. Since the war, making money in Britain has depended to a remarkable extent on property speculation. Many of the great private fortunes created since 1945 have had a property ele- ment, even in businesses like retailing and hotels, which at first glance seem to make their money in some other way. The importance of property stems, of course, from Britain's consistently high inflation rate, and - for individuals - from a tax system which for much of the post-war period treated property profits less harshly than income earned in other ways. If Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary Sys- tem has permanently lowered the UK inflation rate; and if the tax reforms of the 1980s prove lasting - two fairly big ifs - then property is no lon- ger a uniquely privileged route to wealth. British Aerospace has dis- covered that. However, the dis- illusionment with its shares reflects more than property disinflation. Since late August, when the market first began to take suggestions of an immi- nent rights issue seriously, the share price has headed directly south. It was trading at 576p on August 27; by the day before its rights issue announcement, the share price had fallen to 508p. The rights issue is priced at 380p, a 25 per cent discount on the previous day's price and a 34 per cent discount on its price as at August 27. Since the rights issue was announced, the share price has Share prices relative to the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 Me May 19 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 VWI~Â· ~UUII~III soume: uawwslream continued to fall, worsened by the open unhappiness of insti- tutional shareholders. It closed on Friday afternoon at 416p, a 139p drop on the week. On that figure, the rights issue dis- count has shrunk to 9 per cent. By comparison, the other big aerospace result of the week, from Rolls-Royce, was treated much more kindly. Although its results were no less dire - a drop of 90 per cent in interim profits compared with British Aerospace's 41 per cent - Rolls saw its share price close at 144p, a Ip rise on the week. Of course, Rolls was not making a rights issue. There is more to it than that, however. Rolls's strategy, though inevi- tably a risky one, is straight- forward: you knbw what you're betting on. British Aerospace, with its four wildly different core businesses, its heavy dependence on a single Saudi contract, and the fading lustre of its chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith, remains much more of an enigma. And no one likes to feel they are betting blind. These two poor sets of fig- ures - and the justified expec- tation of a British Aerospace rights issue - helped keep the market overall market moving downwards for much of the week. The FT-SE index closed at 2625.8, a drop of 41.6 points from the previous Friday. Other earnings in the capital goods sector also came in below analysts' forecasts, a marked reversal from the wave of not quite so bad as expected results earlier in the summer. One company able to report good news was Glaxo, which not only turned in results ahead of expectations - a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to June - but also promised \"a new cycle of growth\" from recently- launched drugs such as Zofran, used in cancer treatment, Sere- vent, for asthma sufferers, and Imigran, an anti-migraine prep- aration. Sir Paul Girolami, Glaxo's chairman, promised that the company would become the biggest research and development spender in the world drug industry. The share price closed the week at 1364p, down 1 per cent or 17p. These results were accompa- nied by the market's steadily increasing conviction that the UK economic recovery was on track. One tiny textile com- pany actually had the temerity to say \"For us the recession is over,\" but few other company chairmen were ready to go that far. By Friday, despite slightly disappointing inflation figures, the money markets were clearly signalling an expecta- tion of another half-point cut in base rates some time soon - an expectation rendered the more plausible by a cut in US interest rates. The real determinant of UK interest rates remains those in Germany, however, and there the message is not so good. It is clear the the German author- ities are determined to clamp down on wage increases likely to be running at a 7 per cent annual rate by early next year, and to do that they are pre- pared to hold interest rates at or above their current levels for the forseeable future. That is likely to put a floor under British interest rates; and as UK inflation falls into the 3-4 per cent range over the next year, real interest rates will rise steadily. Interest rate pressures next year will put a brake on the speed of the UK recovery, and on the size of the rebound in corporate profits. They will also make the returns from property invest- ment look unpromising - which is where we came in. Peter Martin",

   "text_content" : "All-Share Index FT-Actuaries Index Market rise beats its own rule The old stock market rule \"Sell in May and go away, come back on St Leger Day\" has not been borne out this year. The FT-A All-Share has risen almost 5 per cent since May 1. Nevertheless, believers in this adage can take heart from the fact that investors did far better in the period September 15 1990 to April 30 1991 than they did in either the May-St Leger periods of 1990 or 1991. Bearish time for bullion When Gorbachev was temporarily ousted in last month's coup in the Soviet Union, for a brief moment it was hoped that gold might regain its status as a safe haven in troubled times. However, the rise in the gold price, like the coup, was short lived and this week the bullion price slumped to a five year low. Ironically, the cause was fears that the newly autonomous Soviet republic might dump their gold reserves on the world market. More mortgage rate cuts announced More banks and building societies announced mortgage rate cuts this week. Barclays Bank says rates will be dropped to 11.55 per cent for new mortgage applicants from Monday and existing borrowers from October 1. National Wesiminster bank brought down its rate to 11.55 per cent for new borrowers on September 9. Norlthern Rock building society is offering 9.95 per cent on new loans to borrowers who take out the society's buildings and contents insurance; the rate will be held until January 1993. Otherwise, the rate is 11.2 per cent, which will be effective from Monday. Cheshire Building Society has cut its rate by 0.45 per cent to 11.5 per cent for new borrowers. The Town and Country, Scarborough and West Bremwich societies have also cut their rates to 11.5 per cent. Bradlerd and Bnlagey building society, which dropped its rate to 11.5 per cent, this week announced a 0.5 per cent discount on all new home loans. The discount will be held to March 1992. Smaller companies rally Smaller companies shares continued their recent rally with the County Nat West Smaller Companies Index up 1.4 per cent in the week to September 12, at 1001.65, and the Hoare Govett Index (capital gains version) up 1.2 per cent to 1252.97 over the same period. Savings snceme launched by TR Touche Remnant has added a monthly income plan to its investment trust savings scheme. By investing in three trusts, City of London, High Income and Far East Income, which pay quarterly dividends, investors can opt for a monthly income. On September 13, the trusts yielded 5.2 per cent, 7.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively. A feless oredt ard National and Provincial building society said this week that it would not be introducing a fee for its Visa credit card either this year or next year. The promise comes within a fortnight of announcements by National Westminster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland that they would be introducing an annual ee. N&P has around 250,000 customers for ts visa card.

   "text_content" : "L IKE a spoilt child who grows bored with a new toy minutes after ripping off the wrap- ping paper, the stock market greeted yesterday's interest rate cut with a marked lack of enthusiasm. The Federal Reserve gave the market what it had wanted for weeks - a cut in the dis- count rate from 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent - but a wave of selling sent the Dow Jones index tumbling by a 22.14- point fall to 2,985 by late morning. Why did the market react so negatively to what, on paper at least, was good news? For one, the rate cut was expected, and its impact on share prices had been all but fully discounted. Yet the \"buy on the rumour, sell on the fact\" theory does not account for everything. At the heart of yesterday's, and the week's, poor market show- ing is the simple fact that with the interest rate cut out of the way, there are few good rea- sons left why investors should buy stocks. The Fed said it cut the dis- count rate \"in light of weak- ness in the money and credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment and concerns about the ongoing strength of the economic expansion.\" That statement, plus the new economic figures that provoked the Fed into lowering interest rates, helps explain why investors are in a bearish mood. The one bright spot this week was the news on infla- tion. Data for August show producer and consumer prices rising at a very modest pace. However, the cost of low infla- tion has been a squeeze on consumer expenditure. Existing levels of high indebtedness, rising local and federal taxes, and fear of unemployment have restrained consumer spending. The latest retail sales figures showed by how much: during August sales fell by 0.7 per cent, with the decline spread widely throughout the retail sector. It was the largest monthly fall since January - when the economy was still in a slump - and is hardly evi- dence of an economy pulling confidently away from a recession. The slowdown in money growth remains a problem - it has worried the Fed enough to push the discount rate down 3100 3050 3000 2950 2900 2850 Dow Jones Industrial Average July August September to its lowest level for almost 20 years. Last week M2, the broadest and most widely watched measure of the money supply, fell by $9.7bn, almost four times the market's fore- cast. The most bearish market commentators warn that with insufficient money in the sys- tem to sustain economic expansion and consumers con- taining their desire to spend, the economy, corporate prof- its, and therefore the stock market, are in for a rough ride. Although this view goes against the grain of consensus opinion - which forecasts a reasonable rate of recovery in 1992 - the chances of a sub- stantial correction in the mar- et remain real. Institutional coffers are hardly overflowing with cash, shares look overval- ned in historical terms, and what good news can be expec- ted over the next half-year has already been priced into equi- ties. The inability of the Dow to hold its ground above 3,000 suggests the bulls may have run out of steam. Moreover, the approaching third quarter reporting season holds little of promise. This week several large corpora- tions issued profits warnings alongside cost-cutting and restructuring programmes. Colgate-Palmolive, the household products group which has already undergone extensive restructuring in recent years, said on Thursday that it will close or reconfi- gure 25 of its 91 factories around the world and cut its labour force by another 2,000, or 8 per cent. The changes will cost Colgate a $243m after-tax charge, which will push earn- ings into the red for the third quarter. At least Colgate is institu- ting change against the back- ground of improved profit margins and potential for expansion overseas. Tenneco, the Texas-based industrial and energy group, is not so lucky. The group's new management unveiled a restructuring plan that will include assets sales of more than $1bn and a plant and product rationalisation programme. Tenneco is the victim of depressed market conditions at its agricultural and construction business, where losses are mounting. The slump in US property values - a key feature of the recession - continues to plague anyone who invested heavily in real estate during the 1980s. First Interstate Bancorp, one of the largest west coast US banks, warned this week of a $200m third quarter loss because of a sharp deterioration in its Californian property loan portfolio and a restructuring plan aimed at cutting expenses by $250m a year. Wall Street knows all too well about the desperate state of the east coast property mar- ket, but the problems at First Interstate have highlighted how difficult the situation is on the other side of the country.

   "text_content" : "C ADBURY Schweppes seems to be flavour of the month in the stock market after announcing a 6.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Â£1115m for the first half of the year. Its share price went up 5 per cent to 416p between Wednes- day's announcement and last night's close, while the FT-SE 100 stayed flat Its recession-resistance was predictable, but with so many companies reporting poor results, it was a relief to see progress confirmed, especially in the face of adverse currency movements. Some reasons for Cadbury's resilience are obvious. It has proved easier for consumers to stop buying homes and elec- tronic goods than to take candy from their babies.

In the UK beverage opera- tion, for example, profits were pushed ahead on lower sales. Outside the UK, the Schwep- pes, Canada Dry, Crush and Sunkist brands made gains in the huge Coca-Cola and Pepsi- led soft drinks market in the US, where the average person drinks about 175 litres of pop a year, about two and half times the UK average. According to Sir Graham Day, Cadbury's chairman, the north Americans are \"the most sophisticated\" mbibers ofa car- bonated drink, taking to such delicacies as Schweppes rasp- berry ginger ale.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor lights of New York. Over the past few weeks, share prices on Wall Street have flirted with record highs and easily shook off the brief scare caused by the failed Russian coup. At the moment, US unit trusts are dominating the per- formance tables, with 24 of the top 25 performing funds being American-based. The average US unit trust has risen by 33.5 per cent (offer-to-bid, with income reinvested) over the 12 months to September 1. However, unit trust inves- tors, and the people who advise them, have a disturbing ten- dency to leap on to the band- wagons of rising stock mar- kets. It would be extremely foolish to extrapolate those fig- ures over the next 12 months. And it may well be time for those who have enjoyed the market's giddy rise to take some profits. Watching league tables is a dangerous sport. Not so long ago, Japanese smaller compa- nies dominated the tables; but MIM Britannia's Japanese smaller companies trust, for example, has been one of the worst performing funds over the past year, falling by 17 per cent. When deciding to move in to any market, investors should ignore the historical gains and concentrate instead on the basic ratios that investment analysts use. Take for example dividend yields, which have an inverse relationship to share prices: when yields are low, share prices are relatively high and vice versa. The average yield on the Dow Jones industrial index since the start of 1979 has been 4.6 per cent. Currently the Dow is yielding around 3 per cent. The only time that the yield has been lower was in the bull market of 1987 - when it fell to 2.5 per cent. The price-earnings ratio, which relates share prices to corporate profits, tells a simi- lar story. Since the start of 1979, the p/e on the Standard & Poor's composite index has averaged 11.1. Currently the ratio is around 16.7, a level that again it only pipped dur- ing the 1987 bull market. The US has spent much of this year in economic reces- sion, and analysts are still debating whether or not a recovery has started. In the middle of recession, one would expect yields to be lower and p/ e ratios higher than average, since investors will be concen- trating on the prospects for profit and dividend growth when the economy picks up. But the recovery will have to be quite strong to justify cur- rent price levels. If dividends grew at 23 per cent a year for the next two years, and the Dow stayed unchanged at its Thursday closing level of 3,007, It may well be time for those who have enjoyed the market's giddy rise to take some profits. the yield on the index would still be below the 12-year aver- age of 4.6 per cent. Corporate earnings could rise by 22 per cent a year over the next two years and still not bring the pi e on the Standard & Poor Com- posite back down to the 12-year average 11.1. To put these figures in per- spective, when the US last came out of recession in the early 1980s, yields hovered in a range between 6.5 and 4.5 per cent. It is still far from clear just how strong the US economic recovery will be. Over the sum- mer, economic data have seemed to alternate between good and bad news. Some have even claimed that the economy is heading for a \"double dip\", where it will appear to recover, only to lapse back into reces- sion. If the recovery is very weak, or delayed, then its very hard to see how shares can sustain current ratings. There are, of course, count- er-arguments. Interest rates in the US are now - at 5 per cent - so low that cash deposits are unattractive. US institutional investors' enthusiasm for push- ing funds into the equity mar ket is perfectly understandable in the circumstances. Even with a yield of only 3 per cent, they would require a rise in share prices of just 4 per cent over the next year to earn a better return than is available from deposits. In addition, US inflation is relatively low. So far this year, on an annualised basis, the seasonal rate of inflation is just 2.7 per cent. At that level, investors can enjoy a real return on equities without the need for capital growth. However, despite these sac- tors, the Dow-Jones index has seemed to find a natural ceil- ing at around 3,050. Investors might eventually lose their enthusiasm and perhaps look to overseas markets, where yields and price-earnings ratios look more attractive. What that means for UK investors is hard to judge. If the US market falls substan- tially, the London market tends to follow it down. After- noon trading in the London market is often dominated by the mood on Wall Street. Nevertheless, the investment ratios make the UK market look nowhere near as over-val- ued as the US market, with the dividend yield on the FT-A All- Share Index, for example, at 4.65 per cent. That is below the long term 5 per cent average but not greatly so. If international investors do decide to switch funds out of Wall Street, then London could be the beneficiary. But that might not be enough to save share prices from being affected by the decline in confi- dence a fall in Wall Street would cause. Whether or not the London market has further to fall, the cautious UK investor should steer well clear of the siren charms of Wall Street."

   "text_content" : "HE MEDIA may rejoice every time that interest rates are reduced, but base rate cuts are not such good news for savers. A saver relying purely on variable rate interest will have seen his nominal income reduced by almost a third over the past year, as base rates have fallen from 15 to 10.5 per cent. However, the effect has not been as marked in real terms. Interest rates have averaged around 12% per cent over the last year, compared with an inflation rate of 4.7 per cent. That means investors with substantial savings have been able to earn a gross real return of almost 8 per cent. Even after tax, those in the basic rate band have earned a net return of over 4.5 per cent, and high rate taxpayers 2.8 per cent. Those are extremely high figures by historical standards. But what should investors do now? Should they opt for fixed rate products, such as guaranteed income bonds, on the grounds that rates have further to fall? Or have they left it too late? Economic analysts expect interest rates to fall in the run-up to the next election. Kevin Gardiner, of Warburg Securities, feels that a further half per- centage point cut - to 10 per cent - is already discounted by the market, and will occur at or slightly before the Con- servative party conference, which starts on October 11. Further cuts are expected before the election, which the economists think will be delayed until next summer. By that time, Kevin Darlington, of Phillips & Drew, sees 9'/ per cent as the likely level, with Simon Briscoe of Greenwell Montagu forecasting 9 per cent. After the election, the analysts think that rates may rise, even if the Conser- vatives win power once more. \"Once the economy starts to grow again, the foreign exchange markets will begin to realise that the fall in wage inflation was largely due to the recession\", says Kevin Gardiner, of Warburg Securities. \"There may need to be a second leg to the exchange rate mechanism's squeeze on the UK economy.\" Kevin Darlington of Phillips & Drew cites the likely widening of Britain's current account deficit, once the econ- omy expands, as a reason for rates to rise again. But neither expects rates to go all the way back to 15 per cent - a modest rise to 10 or 10% per cent is more likely. The election of a Labour government, or a hung Parliament, is another mat- ter. If that happened, the analysts expect that the foreign exchange mar- kets would react unfavourably, forcing a more substantial rise in rates. Briscoe thinks that a Labour government might cause rates to be 2 to 3 per cent higher, for a year or two, than they would otherwise have been. These views indicate that interest rates will move in a more narrow trad- ing range - perhaps between 9 and 12 per cent - than they have done over the past five years. That does not give savers a clear view on whether they should switch their funds into fixed rate vehicles immediately. Rates could easily be back at current levels in 18 months. Of course, economists can be mis- taken; there is a tendency for rates to rise further in the upswing of the cycle, and fall further on the downswing, than the market expects. The wise saver should realise that a sensible spread of savings would have some tied to a fixed rate, and some in a variable rate form. Even though inter- est rates might rise after the election, the consensus seems to be that Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism means that interest rates and inflation will be lower in the 1990s than they were in the 1980s. That may indicate that it is not too late for savers to opt for fixed rate products. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

   "text_content" : "ENDOWMENT mortgages were singled out for crit- icism by Sir David Walker, Chairman of the Secu- rities and Investments Board, the chief regulatory body for the financial services industry, this week. Sir David, who was present- ing a discussion paper as part of Sib's review of the retailing of investment products, said it was \"troublesome\" that so many endowments were being sold because of the industry's remuneration structure - the fact that insurance companies pay commission to advisers and agents who are selling their poliies. Endowment mortgaes make up threequarters of the mort- gage market, according to fig- ures issued by the Council of Mortgage Lenders for the last quarter of 190. Unlike the repayment mort- gage, where capital and inter- est are paid back together, on an endowmeant mortgge, only inteest on the loan is repaid. In addition, prem s are paid to an insurance company which invests thm in order to build up a lump sum which will pay back the capital at the end of the mortgage term. Demand for endowment mortgages has fallen in recent years. Repayment mortgages now account for 21 per cent of the market, according to the CML, and 4 per cent of mort- gages are of other types, such as pension or PEP-linked. Endowment mortgages used to account for 80 per cent Sir David was speaking in the context of a controversial proposal by Sib that the requirement that intermedi- aries give \"best advice\" to ci- ents should be changed to giv- ing \"good advice\". The Consumers' Association, among others, has attacied tinhe move, saying it would lower the standard of advice. Sib says its proposal Is intended to deine more dearly the \"suitability\" requrement under which \"best advice\" faDs. It says \"best\" advice In not always the most suitable and the current rules riaed obscuring the importance of i dngsLYble\" advice Sib pains to the meviense of a survey which it conducted of a tied agency - a company which sells the products of one particular life insurance group. The agents went through a factfinding exercise with each client. Sib found that between 35 and 50 per cent of the clients received \"inappropriate\" advice. One reason for this, said Sir David, is that some intermediaries Interpret \"best advice\" to mean selling the products of the best company, at the expe11e of recommend- ing the mast suitable product Under the new proposals, -\"ultahlty\" weold mean that the adviser would not be able to recommend a policy that people would be better off without. Sir David sadd this was pWticla true of endow- ment mortgages - \"most adIce of an - mul e hind hIs been mds in ths ame.\" He said that endowment mortgags mid their pla, but that In amo c -ss comr were being Sld these when they MWgt be better off with repaymInt mortagi and OUieDVABBalpiMd ffyO can afford it. Building societies know that we think endow- ments are oversold.\" Fears that endowments may not be the best type of mort- gage for some people is based on estimates that 80 per cent of endowment polies are cashed in early. Consumers seem unaware that early surrender makes endowments a poor investment - by cashing in a Â£30 a month policy after 20 years investors receive 2 per cent of what they would get at the end of its -year term. I endowmenis are not adt- Abie for may peoqp, why do three out of febr hemeblyms qpt for them?

If your monthly pre- mium is Â£100, the amount invested in the first three years is actually Â£70 per month. Sib has said it is considering obliging intermediaries to make surrender values more dear to the borrower. But it says its room for mainoevre is limited on the commissions. \"Tiere is a stmar argument that the coZmmlslon system of reanmeration of agents is basi- caly flawed and in coammon with many remsndnts to our review, I would much paefr to see a bmld system,\" said Sir David \"But I cannot wa a magic vad to prodWce It.

   "text_content" : "S AVINGS rates are already beginning to come down Safter last week's base rate cut. National Westminster Bank and Nationwide Anglia Building Society, among oth- ers, have announced cuts in rates on savers' accounts of half a percentage point or more. Nationwide's Cash- builder, for example, now pays 9.1 per cent gross on deposits of Â£5,000 to Â£9,999. How can those savers who believe that interest rates are set to fall even further, lock in at current levels? Peter Hatton of Knight Wil- liams, investment advisers, recommends that savers who choose the fixed rate option for part of their portfolio should tie up their money only for one year or two at the most. He suggests guaranteed income bonds, which require an invest- ment for a fixed period but which pay yearly income. As our table shows, General Port- folio has a one year income bond which pays 8.6 per cent net on Â£20,000; the return on Â£50,000 is 9.1 per cent net. Savers can also look to the fixed interest deposit accounts offered by most banks and building societies, though the rates on these are not as high as they are with guaranteed income bonds. For example, Halifax's Monthly Income Extra has a fixed one year rate on a minimum of Â£2,000 of 9.53 per cent gross, which works out at 7.15 per cent net. Wimbledon and South West Finance has a one year fixed rate deposit account of 12 per cent gross for Â£1,000, which is under review. The TSB has a 2 year fixed account on deposits of Â£2,000 with a return of 9.25 per cent gross. There are also a number of fixed-rate Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (Tessas). Confederation Bank is offering a fixed rate of 11 per cent but this requires a deposit of Â£8,055, from which the bank transfers annually the maxi- mum permitted to the Tessa. The bank guarantees that after five years the investor will receive Â£13,136. The fixed rate will drop to 10.75 per cent for entrants from 1 October who will have to deposit Â£20 more than the current requirement. Bristol and West has a simi- lar feeder account Tessa with a fixed rate of 11.25 per cent, which is under review. Gilts are another fixed rate option but it is essential to hold them to maturity to guar- antee your return. Income tax will have to be paid on interest income but there is no capital gains tax. Gilts maturing in 1994 have a gross redemption yield of around 9.5 per cent. Investors might consider index-linked gilts, which pay a low rate of interest but whose capital value rises in line with inflation. Another inflation- proof investment is index- linked National Savings certifi- cates which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent above the rate of infla- tion if held for five years. National Savings also has two fixed rate products. Which you choose depends on your tax band. The Capital Bond Series C, which pays out 11.5 per cent gross, is more attrac- tive to basic rate and non-tax- payers. The 36th issue, which pays 8.5 per cent tax-free, offers a better deal to those in the higher rate band. Over the long term the best returns are likely to be from equity-based investments. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, cites the differential growth of various investments over the last ten years (all figures show income reinvested). The Halifax 90 day building society account showed 149.1 per cent growth; the FTSE 100 index, 263.6 per cent and an average of all gilts and fixed interest trusts, 183.1 per cent. For those seeking an equity- based investment, Boyton rec- ommends James Capel Income Fund, a unit trust, which con- centrates on UK equities. For the same period, its growth has been 694.7 per cent. Those seeking income and growth could consider a self-se- lect Personal Equity Plan, says James Higgins, of advisers Chamberlain de Broe. The investor can buy high-yielding income shares of an invest- ment trust within the PEP, which will allow income to be drawn gross. Separately, the investor can hold zero coupon shares, which will eventually be repaid at a premium to their price, outside the PEP and use up his capital gains allowance. Higgins esti- mates that this combination should provide a tax free income of about 10 per cent. Scheherazade Dimeshkhu.",

   "text_content" : "CREDIT CARD holders attempting comparisons among banks by checking annual percentage rates may not realise how meaningless this exercise has become since the introduction of annual fees. This is because the banks use different methods of calcu- lation, and sometimes make strange assumptions about the behaviour of cardholders. For example, a Lloyds Bank leaflet just sent out to Access card holders includes a table of annual percentage rates rang- ing down from 32.9 per cent on a credit limit of Â£200 to 25.6 per cent on Â£5,000. At a glance, it might seem that Lloyds is offering larger borrowers cheaper credit, but not so: the interest rate is a uniform 1.9 per cent per month. The apparently lower rate is the result of spreading the annual Â£12 card fee over the larger amount. Leaving out the fee altogether would give an interest-only rate of 25.3 per cent. When quoting an APR in advertising or promotion, Lloyds uses 26.8 per cent - the rate on Â£1,000, which the bank says is a typical credit limit, unrelated either to average actual spending or outstanding balances. Lloyds would not say how much of a typical credit limit is typically used. In calculating card APRs, Lloyds assumes that the bor- rowing begins on the first day of the year and accrues inter- est until the last day when it is repaid in full. The bank claims that this method if anything overstates its rate, as its com- mercial experience shows that most cardholders clear debt within four to six months. But Barclays says that Lloyds, Midlands and National Westminster are understating their APRs, mainly because the Â£1,000 basis and one-year pay- back is unrealistic. Barclays quoted on Â£750, the credit limit routinely granted to new cardholders, but admits that its average outstanding balance is only Â£300. Its pay- back period runs to 8% years, with 5 per cent of the balance or Â£5 cleared each month and fees charged annually. So, although Barclaycard's monthly interest is 1.85 per cent and its annual fee is Â£8, it quotes an APR of 27.8 per cent against Lloyds' 26.8 per cent on 1.9 per cent monthly and Â£12 fee. Barclays claims that its rate would drop from 27.8 per cent to 25.9 per cent on the same basis. The variations are perfectly I, S Easy to use, hard to add up legal, since the Consumer Credit Regulations offer a choice of three methods of cal- culating card APRs. Lenders are also allowed a further psychologically useful advantage in being able to quote a rate of up to 0.1 per cent below the \"true\" APR, as calculated under the rules. This could permit a strategic switch from, say, 30 per cent to 29.9 per cent. The banks are clearly edging credit cards into the same high-cost confusion zone as overdrafts. For borrowers, overdrafts from different sources are almost impossible to compare because of the vari- ety of largely discretionary charges applied. The interest cost of overdraft borrowing is notoriously difficult to establish in advance, being linked to amounts actually out- standing and variable interest rates. Now that card issuers have begun carging terest on outstanding dailbalances - unless the debt s paid off in full on the monthly due date - cardholders unable to clear their amounts regularly will have to time purchases for late in the month and pay off as much as possible without waiting for the statement to arrive. However, the banks may not be co-operative. \"We do not encourage people to make pay- ments during the month,\" said Barclaycard. Meanwhile, the Access leaf- let from Lloyds introduces a change to conditions that reads: \"Payments will take effect when credited and may be applied to transactions and charges in such order as the bank may determine. In overdraft-aping style, Lloyds' leaflet indicates that the bank - the first to intro- duce an annual fee on cards - appears to be contemplating a further array of open-ended charges. However, Lloyds gives three different versions of its inten- tions, two of which appear in the leaflet. \"Currently, we do not charge for additional services, such as, a request for a duplicate state- ment,\" says one part of the leaflet, adding \"Condition 15 is new and would enable us to introduce such charges, but only after a published tariff has been sent to you.\" But the densely printed wording of condition 15 gives a rather different impression, saying: \"The Bank may debit to the account such additional charges as may be payable in accordance with its tariff applicable from time to time (detail of which are available on request...) in respect of any additional information and/or services provided at the request of the cardholder which the bank is not obliged to provide under this agree. ment or in respect of any breach of these terms by the cardholder, together with any costs and expenses which the bank may incur in enforcing or endeavouring to enforce its rights against the cardholder.\" \"There is no tariff and there is nothing in the pipeline,\" said a'Lloyds Bank representative responding to a request for details. \"We felt it was a pru- dent move to add the condition now in case we need to intro- duce something at some stage in the future.\""

He resigned from Lloyd's in 1985 but still found himself writing a cheque for Â£17,000 this July to cover claims he incurred while he was a member. He is not alone in his views; stop-loss is a controversial sub- ject at Lloyd's. For members of the troubled insurance market, it would be hard to imagine a more alluring product label. However some argue that the product itself does not always live up to its name. Personal stop-loss has been available to Lloyd's Names - the individuals who stake their personal wealth on underwrit- ing at Lloyd's - since the early 1970s. In 1973 it became a tax deductible expense. Stop-loss is technically a misnomer. The cover cannot stop Names' insurance losses at Lloyd's in entirety. Lloyd's Names accept unlimited liabil- ity for losses on insurance business underwritten on their behalf. Stop-loss does not change that. It merely removes a layer of risk. The cover is sold by special- ist Lloyd's broking firms and underwritten by Lloyd's syndi- cates and insurance compa- nies. The council of Lloyd's last year imposed tough rules limiting the amount of stop- loss business Lloyd's syndi- cates could write: they feared the stop-loss market was becoming too \"incestuous\". Cover varies, but typically a Name underwriting Â£500,000 premium a year at Lloyd's might buy stop-loss cover of Â£100,000. The Name would pay the first Â£50,000 losses, but the next Â£100,000 would be paid by the stop-loss reinsurers. Only in the unlikely event of losses in any one year exceeding Â£150,000 would liability revert to the Name. Alternatively, Names might use stop-loss as a form of catas- trophe protection to cover themselves against losses which would seriously eat into their wealth. The excess point in this case would be much higher, say Â£100,000, and the premium much lower. Michael Wade, chairman of Holman Wade, a Lloyd's broker which earns the bulk of its income selling stop-loss, is a stop-loss evangelist. The case Wade makes for stop-loss is still persuasive. \"On becoming a member of Lloyd's you will wish the syn- dicates you support to buy reinsurance protection. So what is more natural than that you should buy reinsurance protection for your own per- sonal liabilities as well?\" He acknowledges that the personal stop-loss market can be a minefield for the unwary. Names, who are usually not insurance professionals, are plunged into the complexities of the international reinsur- ance market. For this reason Wade and other stop-loss brokers lay great stress on the advice given to Names by members' agents at Lloyd's. Members' agents are responsible for han- dling the affairs of Names including, crucially, selecting the syndicates in which they participate. Choosing a mem- bers' agent is the most impor- tant decision a prospective member of Lloyd's must make. However most members agents are chary about advis- ing Names on stop-loss. They generally tell Names that the cover is available and offer advice if asked. But they tend to stop short of recommending specific products. Some, such as Alec Foster, who looks after 350 Names at members agency Roberts and Hiscox, are dubious. \"We have never been particularly keen on stop-loss. On our estimates over the past 20 years none of our Names would have made a claim on stop-loss, had they had it in place.\" He claims the agency has saved its Names money by not pushing stop-loss. Only around 5 per cent of the agency's Names buy the cover, he says. This is partly because Roberts and Hiscox places its Names on syndicates that it manages itself. Their liabilities on these syndicates may repre- sent up to 50 or 60 per cent of their total liabilities. This aggregation of risk makes stop- loss underwriters nervous and they raise the premiums. So how much does stop-loss cost? Brokers say that pre- mium rates vary widely depending on the individual Name's circumstances. But David Seel, a stop-loss broker at Robert Fraser Insur- ance Brokers, suggests some \"ball park figures\": \"Supposing you're a middle ranging Name writing between Â£300,000 and Â£400,000 across a good range of syndicates. For Â£100,000 worth of cover excess of 10 per cent [ie Â£30,000 or Â£40,000), you might expect to pay around Â£3,000 - tax deductible.\" Wade quotes similar figures and says stop-loss is a \"sensa- tional deal for members of Lloyd's.\" He is mystified that only around half of Lloyd's 25,500 Names are covered. Perhaps the most fitting ver- dict on the stop-loss market is given by John Robson, who heads the Merrett members' agency at Lloyd's - one of the largest, looking after 850 Names. \"It's a bit of a jungle\", he says. Some of the more jaundiced Names, facing losses which may yet total Â£lbn this year, might argue that in that respect it does no more than mirror the Lloyd's market as a whole.",

   "text_content" : "THE NUMBER of sales this week has been swollen by an unusually large number of directors exercising options and selling their entitlement. Of these the largest has been supermarket company, Argyll Group, but Racal Electronics also features with four direc- tors selling on exercise. In April, we highlighted con- centrated selling by directors in construction company Birse Group at around 180p per share. This week there have been further sales by one direc- tor at 143p. The recession has not dented profits growth at exhibitions organiser Blenheim. Until now profit taking has been largely avoided, but the sales suggest some directors simply cannot resist the latest rally in the share price. Even so, one direc- tor has made a modest addition to his holding. One of the two executive directors of Henry Ansbacher has been a heavy buyer of the shares. Like so many of the smaller merchant banks Ans- bacher has had its share of bad debtors, but the shares are underpinned by assets. Angus MacDonald, Directus Ltd",

   "text_content" : "THIS WEEK brought added spice to a night out at the theatre: would ticket-holders actually get in to see the show? When the Keith Prowse ticket agency collapsed last Monday it seemed that many who had bought ticket vouch- ers from the company would lose both their money and their chance of seeing the production. As it turned out, relatively few ticket-holders were denied entry to London theatres last week. After some frst night nerves, virtually all 95 London theatres accepted that it was in their best interests to con- tinue to show Keith Prowse ticket holders to their seats. The credit and charge card companies - also alter some initial misgivings - agreed to reimburse any ticket holder who failed to gain entry, een though the Consumer Credit Act only insists on repayment for transactias over L1n .

It argues that the contract i between the ticket-older and the thea- tre or venue, not with the agent, adl therefore must be honoure. Otherwise, c en- sation c be sought through the courts.

   "text_content" : "GERALD RATNER will certainly regret his recent throwaway comment on the quality of one product sold by his jewellery group when inter- ims are announced next week. His less-than-flattering joke about a sherry decanter turned some people away from Rat- nersn, although some probably went next door to his separate \"upmarket\" stores. The group as a whole is expected to announce on Mon- day a plunge to a Â£15m1 loss, compared with a Â£9.3m profit last time. Heavy losses in the UK are likely to be the main reason behind the decline. Kingfisher is expected to show on Tuesday a drop from Â£65.4m to about Â£60m, mainly because of a sharp fall in prof- its from property development. However, deepening losses at Woolworths and Comet will also contribute. All in all, a reasonable performance in recessionary times, according to analysts. Tesco, the same day, will perhaps have the best news in the food and retailing sector with profits forecast to rise 33 per cent to Â£230m for the first half. However, the rights issue in January means earnings per share are expected to increase just 15 per cent to 8.1p. On Tuesday Fisons, the pharmaceutical and horticul- tural products group, is expec- ted to report interim pre-tax profits of Â£105m, up 16 per cent from last year, giving earnings per share of 11.7p, up 12 per cent on the previous interims. The market is expectantly waiting for news of US approval for its Tilade, anti- asthma drug. Guinness, the international drinks group, is likely to report on Thursday interim taxable profits of Â£350m compared with last year's Â£322m. The expected 8 per cent increase, while not as sparkling as the 33 per cent rise during the comparable period, was achieved against difficult trading conditions, which included the Gulf War. It is no secret that trading has been rough for Hawker Siddeley, making for slim chances that there will be any lift in interim profits, to be announced on Thursday. The City is looking for pre-tax prof- its of around Â£60m, although some analysts' forecasts are lower. This is substantially down from the Â£94m realised at the last interim, stripping out heavy contracting losses sus- fered then. Those at the upper end of the scale are counting on benefits from reorganisa- tions and redundancies coming through.",

   "text_content" : "age are more interested in getting capital growth, rather than income, from their investments. However, many keep the bulk of their savings in a building society, which is really designed to provide income. If you really want capital growth, you have to give up something that a build- ing society offers. You may need to accept a lower income, or you may have to tie your money up for five years. Often, you face the prospect that your capital could fall in value. But these risks have to be taken. The old saw \"You have to speculate to accumulate\" holds true. Equities have traditionally been seen as the ideal investment for achieving capital growth. But for many investors, buying shares is too frightening, because of the risk of a fall in prices. In fact, there are two distinct forms of risk involved in buying shares. The first is that you might buy a holding in a company which goes bust, or plunges into loss. The second is that the stock market as a whole might fall in value. 1. Investment trusts - ordinary shares There is little one can do about market risk. But an investment trust, which owns a portfolio of stocks, can protect investors from the danger of selecting the wrong company. Trusts have relatively low charges. If you buy into a trust through a savings scheme the initial charge can be as low as 0.2 per cent; annual management fees are often less than 1 per cent. There are risks - the price of invest- ment trust shares does not rise and fall precisely in line with the value of the portfolios. Frequently the shares trade at a discount to the trust's assets and if this discount widens, investors can lose money even if the stock market is unchanged. The trust's managers can also make mistakes in stock selection. 2. Investment trusts - capital shares Most investment trusts aim for both growth and income but there are cer- tain types of trust, called split capital trusts, which separate the two func- tions. Capital shares in such a trust normally receive no income and can only be repaid if the trust's assets rise significantly over its lifetime. They are thus high risk but can do spectacularly well if the stock market booms. Those who are really bullish on the stock mar- ket might be attracted; those of a ner- vous disposition should steer clear. 3. Investment trusts - zero dividend shares Some split capital trusts also offer zero dividend shares which, as their name suggests, pay no income. They will, however, be repaid at a set premium when the trust is eventually wound up. Though such an event is not guaran- teed, the trust would have to perform disastrously for zero dividend share- holders to miss out. Such shares thus offer low risk, steady growth. 4. Unit trusts Unit trusts offer the same diversified portfolio as investment trusts but in a different structure. Rather than buying shares, you buy units which rise and fall in line with the value of the fund - there is no discount to worry about. However, costs are higher. There is an initial charge of at least 5 per cent, which is included in a bid-offer spread when you buy units. This means that the fund has to make significant prog- ress just for you to recoup your original investment. Annual management fees are in the range of 1 to 1% per cent. There is such diversity in the unit and investment trust industry that the investor can pick almost any invest- ment field his heart desires - from UK blue chips to Japanese smaller compa- nies, from gold to New Zealand. Pick one with a consistent record over at least the last three years. 5. Personal Equity Plans Investments in a PEP are free of both capital gains and income tax. This makes them, for some people, an attrac- tive way of holding shares. However, one needs to pick a PEP carefully. Unless you have a large portfolio of other investments the capital gains tax exemption is unlikely to be of much benefit. Tax is only payable on gains of over Â£5,500 in any year - and allow- ance is made for indexation and for losses on other investments. Even the income tax exemption can be outweighed by the charges imposed by the plan manager. However, unit trust PEPs usually carry no extra fees and investment trust PEP charges are fairly low. Unfortunately, such plans Philip Coggan outlines the choices for investors in search of growth rather than income are limited to Â£3,000 per year. 6. Direct equity investment The profits earned on privatisation issues must have tempted many into buying shares directly. But therein lies the danger. Privatisations are one-off issues, priced in a way that normally ensures they are a bargain. It is far harder to spot cheap shares elsewhere in the market, and private investors can be sucked into \"glamour\" stocks which turn bad, such as Polly Peck. A diversified portfolio of at least ten or a dozen stocks is essential and given the dealing costs, you will probably need to start with at least Â£25,000. Even at that level, many stockbrokers would recommend unit trusts; some brokers require you to have a six figure sum before handling your direct equity \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t investments on an advisory basis. When choosing a broker, the snag is that few will quote performance statis- tics for their private client portfolios - if possible, look at the record of any unit trusts they manage. 7. Employee share option schemes These may offer one of the best ways for investors to get access to equities and thus to capital growth. Top execu- tives did very nicely out of such schemes in the 1980s; the government has recently tried to widen their scope. Under an Employee Share Ownership Plan, workers are given the chance to save up to Â£250 a month. At the end of a period lasting at least five years, they will either receive a building society return or will be able to buy shares at a discounted price. This is a very good deal. Stoy Hayward has calculated that, assuming a modest growth of 5 per cent per annum in the company's share price, someone who saved the maxi- mum could make a capital gain of Â£13,395 over five years. 8. Traded options and warrants These are at the high risk end of the investment spectrum. Both give inves- tors the right to buy securities at a given price at some future date. That right may appear cheap: an option to buy Grand Met shares at 850p in Janu- ary this week cost only 43p. If the Grand Met price rises to 1000p by Janu- ary, then the option will be worth 150p, more than trebling the investor's money. The caveat is that if the Grand Met price falls to 800p the option will be worthless. Options and warrants are thus only suitable for the brave. 9. Index-linked gilts It is not necessary to buy equities to get capital growth. The capital value of index-linked gilts increases in line with the Retail Price Index and there is a small income of 2 or 2% per cent (also index-linked) on top. All capital gains on such gilts are tax-free and there is no credit risk. Long-dated index-linked gilts currently offer a real return to redemption of 4 per cent per annum, a rate which compares well with the returns available on equities. 10. Index-linked National Savings cer- tifeiates These pay no income but increase in value faster than inflation - if held for five years, they offer a real, tax-free, return of 4.5 per cent per annum at no risk. If that rate had been on offer since 1945, an investor buying index-linked certificates would have outperformed one buying equities. The snag is that you can only buy Â£10,000 of them.",

   "text_content" : "281-* in 1961 Â£82* in 1991 There's more than one way to enjoy vintage investments. If something of value is left in safe hands - and the temptation to enjoy it too early is resisted - its value may soar. As you can see. The same objective guides the thinking of The Scottish Eastern Investment Trust plc - long-term capital growth. Scottish Eastern is one of the country's oldest and largest international investment trusts. And like any great vintage, it is handled with great care. Its fund mana- gers scour the world for investment opportunities which can enhance its long- term value. Just consider the results of their endeavours - Â£5,000 invested 10 years ago in Scottish Eastern would now be word Â£26,879. Left in a building society, the sam i nvestmen would be worh L10,909s. Now that's a difference well worth toasting. Whats more, since Scottish Eastern is part of the Martin Currie Savings Plan, investment is easy - a stockbroker isn't even needed. You can invest as little as Â£20 per month or in minimum lump sums of Â£200 - the only charge to you is stamp duty (0.5%). Perhaps it's time to consider stocking the investment cellar with Scottish Eastern? To find out more just cut out the coupon. In a few years, you may well have something to drink to.

With the choice of Two Investment Areas designed specially to meet the needs of both the risk conscious and the slightly more adventurous BES investor. The proposed closing date for applications is I p.m. on October 4th 1991. If all companies are fully subscribed before that date then, at the Directors' discretion, the offers may close early - so, if you are Interested in the Besres VII Schemes please act now. All investments will go into BES Companies set up and advised by Sun Life Investment Management Services Limited (SLIMS). These Besres Companies will invest in residential property for letting on assured tenancies. The objectives of all the Companies will be to maximise returns over five years, based on capital gain and rental income. * TWO STRATEGIES TO CHOOSE FROM * The PHOENIX Companies will invest in residential properties, aiming to benefit from large discounts or development profit combined with relatively high rental yield. This should produce a return similar to that of assured exit schemes, even if property prices remain constant, so offering the investor the prospect of excellent retun - with only moderate risk. * The CAMPUS Companies adopt a strategy of providing residential properties for Universities, Polytechnics and other organisations with an option to sell the property back at a pre- arranged premium at the end of five years. The sale option will be secured by bank commitments or legal charges over assets. SUMS is targetting an uplift in the Companies net asset value per share of 32% from the issue price of shares over five years. So investors will enjoy a high rate ofreturn with a very high degree of security. * EARLY TAX CERTIFICATES A valuable feature of the Besres VII Schemes is that all Companies should 1I These Sch have already started their BES qualifying activity, so investors should which carr receive tax certificates as early as December 1991. 2.

(c) Would my tax situation be adversely affected? I am married, in my mid-seventies and my husband is several years older. I am in good health and would hope to live at least for a further seven years! (a) You must report the loan as a new source of income. (b) The low rate of interest should not cause any particu- lar problems. (c) You will be assessable to income tax on the interest. If the rate of interest may be changed from time to time, you should bear in mind the rules of assessment for untaxed interest: First year in which interest is paid: current year's interest; Second year. current year's interest; Third year: pre- vious year's interest (again) OR current year's interest, whichever you prefer; Fourth year: previous year's interest - and so on, until the year before repayment of the loan, which is assessed for the previ- ous year's interest OR the cur- rent year's interest, whichever be the higher. For the year in which the loan is repaid, you will be assesed on the current year's interest. These odd rules are benefi- cial if the change of rate of interest is always upward, but are penal if the rate of interest is reduced at the wrong moment. Futures liability I WROTE to my tax inspector asking about the tax treat- ment of profits on commodity futures, traded options on these, and traded options on the FTSE index. He replied saying: \"Transac- tions in traded options are regarded as subject to income tax rules only where they are entered into by persons whose profits and losses on disposal of stocks and shares are tax- able under case I of schedule D, eg financial concerns and investment dealing companies. \"Transactions by an individ- ual are normally dealt with under the capital gains tax No lal reponslbllity can obe accptd by the Financial Ttnm lor lh *nswrw given In Mte columns.

I remember reading in your columns some time ago a ref- erence to this subject which implied that the true situation might be quite different. I should be grateful for your comments. If any such profits are in fact taxable as income, I would also welcome your views as to whether any losses on such trades can be offset against income from other sources. * Your tax inspector has given a correct outline of the current position, A free book- let, entitled Taxation of traded options - private clients, is obtainable from the Interna- tional Stock Exchange, Lon- don, EC2N 1HP. It is most unlikely that the general or special commission- ers would find, as a question of fact, that transactions in futures and options by a pri- vate individual fell within the scope of case I of schedule D. Transaction in most futures and options are excluded from the scope of case Vi of schedule D by section 128 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, covering (Inter alia): i) commodity futures and financial futures dealt in on a futures exchange designated by the Inland Revenue. ii) commodity futures and financial futures entered into an authorised person or a listed institution, as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986. iii) options (including war- rants) quoted on a futures exchange or stock exchange designated by the Revenue; iv) stock exchange tradi- tional (conventional) options, and similar options granted by or to a member of an oversea stock exchange designated by the Inland Revenue. v) options relating to cur- rency, shares, securities or an interest rate granted by (and in some circumstances to) an authorised person or a listed institution, as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986. The references to futures exchanges and stock exchanges \"designated by the Inland Revenue\" include the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are designated by statute. Shares for joint tenants FOR NEARLY a year I have read your replies to letters concerning joint tenancy in common and suggestions for parents to reduce the liability for inheritance tax. Ours is a typical case: house worth Â£150,000, stock exchange securities and build- ing society investments of Â£100,000. If we each write our wills so that one quarter of the house is left to each of our two sons, can you explain the pro- cedure required regarding the deeds of the house on the death of the first parent? Will the Land Certificate have to be amended to show the quarter share of each son? Would the surviving parent have to make a fresh will leaving his or her half share equally to the sons in order that they could even- tually dispose of the property to their mutual benefit? A further point is the ques- tion of each parent leaving cash legacies to the sons from the building society funds, which are held in joint names. Do you advise those funds being held equally in the sole names of the parents? * There is no need to amend the Land Certificate as that records the legal estate only, not the equitable interest. However, it is likely that a new trustee will be appointed to hold the legal estate jointly with the survivor, and if that is done the Land Certificate will need to be amended. The survi- vor may make a new will if he/ she so wishes, but does not have to. The building society accounts can remain joint if his legacies are of stated sums.",

So how is the Chomyszak's bridalwear business in funding their life style? \"Desperately is the answer to that one,\" says Elaine Chomyszak. \"We are taking as little as possible out of the business. We are tending to live on a financial knife-edge at home.\" Elaine and her husband, Jerry, own a bridalwear shop in Keighley and a small manu- facturing business just across the town which largely makes bridesmaids dresses for hire. Neither is making a profit. \"There is definitely a market out there,\" says Elaine. \"Per- haps we need to look more closely at our pricing. We might be selling too cheaply.\" The shop, which has been open for several years, will have sales this year of around Â£30,000. The workshop has grown quickly since it started two years ago and is expecting to notch up a turnover in 1991 of more than Â£70,000. Ninety per cent of the 2,000 or so gar- ments it makes yearly are sold to retailers as garb for hire with special side seams to allow alterations and all in washable materials. The bridalwear business seemed to them a good way of making a living. Jerry had been made redundant, follow- ing the closure of a tractor plant in Bradford, and found job-hunting tough in a depressed area, even after tak- ing a three-year business studies course. Elaine had been a part-time lecturer and a pro- sessional seamstress. There was little cash in reserve to fund the ventures, however. The shop was started with a total of Â£20,000, partly raised through a house remort- gage. The workshop had to fund itself. The short life of the two businesses - which share the name Penny Farthing - reveals many of the obstacles facing tiny companies. Unexpected competition arose when another bridalwear retailer opened in Keighley. This contributed to a fall in sales at the Chomyszaks' shop from Â£45,000 last year. The 60 bridalwear retailers the Penny Farthing workshop makes dresses for usually order in tiny numbers and this has caused the Yorkshire company a lot of production grief. \"We were working one order at a time,\" says Elaine, \"doing maybe one pink dress in this style and one blue in that.\" This was a headache to organ- ise and led to the dismissal of the supervisor looking after the workshop's five machin- ists. \"We try to do more runs now, but it is difficult and we don't have the finance to hold stocks of finished dresses.\" The recession has hit the weddings trade. Retail sales nationally are down 25 per cent (the market for bridal dresses alone is worth Â£40m), and demographic shifts will reduce the number of weddings until the middle of the decade. Peo- ple in a struggling industrial town such as Keighley have shallower pockets than many elsewhere. \"If Â£8,000 is the average, I bet Â£2,000 is more typical in Keighley for a wed- ding and honeymoon.\" The couple also realised that margins are squeezed merci- lessly when you are on the first rung of the production ladder. A bridesmaid's dress the workshop sells for Â£40 retails for close to Â£140. The big suppliers, such as Cupid and Hilary Morgan, own both man- ufacturing capacity and high street shops. One good thing for Penny Farthing is that operating a business in West Yorkshire need not be expensive. The shop lease costs Â£6,300 a year. Rent for the local authority- managed workshop is just Â£70 a week. The Japanese indus- trial sewing machines are each leased for between Â£30 and Â£55 a month. The wage bill, though, is close to Â£1,000 a week, at a time when the shop is being forced to reduce Â£350 wedding-dresses by up to Â£100. The Chomyszaks have a few ideas up their sleeve. They are negotiating to sell bridal wear in the Ukraine, from where Jerry's family originally came. The couple only take some Â£10,000 in total for themselves each year from the two busi- nesses. \"It certainly would be nice if we could find an inves- tor who would give us bit of breathing-space and take some of the strain off us.\" * The Penny Farthing, 65 Mantra House, South S, Keigh- ley, West Yorkshire, BD21 1SX Nick Garnett",

   "text_content" : "spent an hour driving to a town, and then another three quarters of an hour trying to find the place where you are staying or attending a meeting? If your name is Trevor Parry the answer is often. Parry, a chartered accountant, was managing director of a building company in Banbury before retiring last summer. Since then he has been a part-time freel- ance lecturer in book-keeping. accounts and finance, working for a mobile training firm in towns up and down the country. His experiences in teaching con- firmed a long-held conviction that that there was a market for a set of bespoke maps showing how to get to specific locations, mainly in towns. Hotels are a good example. So are hospitals, supermarkets, business parks. trading estates, law courts, theatres, cinemas, and, per- haps most of all, football grounds. It was a desperate attempt last autumn to find Northampton Town Football Club that gave birth to Location Maps. The search for the ground took so long that Parry missed the beginning of the game. He went home and committed to paper the ideas that had been going round in his head for several years, and a company was born. The basic idea is simple. The sub- ject of the map - Parry's client - is located on a basic three-miles-to- the-inch Ordnance Survey map. By arrangement with the OS a 115mm by 95mm section with the subject of the map located in the centre, is reproduced in full colour. Beside and beneath the map on an A4 sheet are three other maps, each showing the same \"client location\" in a larger and larger scale. In the first map the client loca- tion - say it is an hotel - will be indicated merely by a square drawn round its immediate vicinity on the ie map. The second map shows that *y square much expanded, the third e. more so and so on. Underneath to maps three and four scales are \\g shown, in miles on map three and s, yards on the largest map, number four. With largest map, which has a b- scale larger than the old six inches - to the mile, users can easily calcu- o- late how far they have to walk or ly drive to get to nearby places, for n example the city centre if they are As staying at a suburban hotel. is A royalty is payable to the Ord- le nance Survey for every section of 4 map used and Parry has registered h a patent application for the system. I\" \"The advantage of Location Maps is that the client location is always i- in the centre of the map and so e there is no need for searching, fold- n ing, creasing or finding oneself Le right on the edge of a map - they are bespoke maps for specific loca- tions,\" Parry said. When he went into action last autumn Parry realised that initial overheads would be high, so he acquired two further directors - a printer friend, and a former col- league. Each put in Â£500 and Parry added another Â£7,000. He acts as executive director and is the only one entitled to draw a salary, which he has not done so far, preferring to put receipts back into the company. The main effort recently has been in recruiting a team of agents who will work on a commission-only basis selling the Location Maps con- cept to potential customers. As well as the hotel and leisure industries Parry is encouraging recruits to go for the stately homes business. He has recruited his sales team mainly through contacts at exhibitions, and largely thanks to the Incentive '91 exhibition at Olympia in May he reckons the company will have sold about Â£50,000 worth of maps by the time of its first birthday in Septem- ber. While Parry is focusing his sales activities on hotel chains and on large companies with training cen- tres, his salesmen are concentrating on the stately homes and the leisure industry. \"From our research we know that the market is very wide indeed. We had a fantastic response from Incen- tive 91 and are still following up leads from it,\" he said. \"Some of our best orders have come from British Telecom. We produced 10,000 copies of a map of their Leafield, Oxon, training centre and that batch will only last a year.\" The basic price for origination and artwork of a Location Map is Â£485. Then, the cost per map varies from 42p to 19p per map, depending on whether the map is laminated or left as a simple A4 sheet and on the size of the print run, The minimum print run is 1,000 but Parry will consider \"specials\" and is currently working on a new credit card-sized map in \"Z-card\" format. Location Maps that fold to other sizes are also a possibility. The back of the standard A4 map can be left blank, or more popularly, be printed with details of the client's business. On a trial run which Parry did at a special price for Banbury and Dis- trict Scout Association the \"client location\" was the town's Scouting Centre and Scout Shop, while on the rear were printed details about how the movement is organised in the town. \"The indication is that we shall make a small profit in our first year, which in the present climate is very encouraging,\" Parry says. \"As we have spent all our initial Â£8,500 on computer hardware and programs, exhibitions, and recruit- ing agents, we shall probably need some further capital as we go into our second year. Initially I shall provide this from my own funds by realising investments. But if the right person comes along offering a large cash injection we shall be quite happy to talk. \"Before thinking too far ahead however we are aiming to develop the idea to its full potential, which includes the big question of how we approach the retail market. If our plans in this direction, and all the other proposals we have made, come to fruition we won't know which way to turn!\" * Location Maps, 1, Sycamore Drive, Banbury, Oxfordshire OX16 9HS. 0295-264160.

   "text_content" : "ST RING quartet accompanies the soft clunk of crc quet balls in front of the neo-classi- cal clubhouse at Hurlingham, London. Spectators doze in deckchairs at the close of an Indian summer. This is British sport at its best. Even when it rains, you cannot beat England for a good game of croquet. Today and tomorrow provide an ideal opportunity (and poes sibly the last for several years) to see the game played at top level in perfect surroundings as players from a dozen coun- tries compete for the World Croquet Championships. Next year, the Americans hope to hi-jack the event. But even in the US they will have a hard time fighting off the Brit- ish talent, and at the start of play last Sunday the home con- tingent, who dominate the international game, were again looking strong. Chris Clarke, at 20 the youngest competitor, opened with three wins. Against the Italian Luigi Colombo he made a flourishing sextuple peel, the equivalent of snooker's 147 break. Robert Fulford, 22, who won the Open Championship earlier this year, had said he felt \"not unconfident\" of retaining the World title. However, he lost at the start of the week to Jim Bast of the US and found him- self struggling in a tough quali- fying blocks. David Openshaw and Step hen Mulliner, the two senior British players, had easier draws. Mulliner swatted aside Frenchman Jean Baptiste Grc chain and Jerry Stark of the US, who has improved consid- erably since he first came to Britain three years ago. Openshaw, known for his ability to hang on to a game until the bitter end, beat Wayne Rodoni of the US and Ian Burridge of Wales but could not shake off New Zea land's Joe Hogan, the first man to win the World title in 1989. Bast's win against Fulford proved that the Americans mean business. Next year, they hope to hold the World Cham- pionship at Newport, Rhode Island, hitherto better known for sailing and tennis. The United States Croquet Associa- tion prides itself on running its affairs as a profit making organisation and their plans for the tournament could test the Corinthian spirit. Tremaine Arkley, a business- man from Independence, Ore- gon and chairman of the USCA's International Commit- tee, says they chose Newport as one of the few venues in the US with enough courts and prestige to match Hurlingham. But there the similarity ends for the Americans want a much more \"accessible\" tour- nament and intend to have \"additional activities\" to pull in the spectators. \"I don't want to call it a 'cir- cus', that's not really fair,\" says Arkley \"but we might have some 'legends of croquet' playing exhibition games and other sporting events coincid- ing with the championship because we're trying to open it to everyone and draw in casual spectators from those who are just in Newport for holiday as well as local residents.\" the USCA's profit-making exercises have included a healthy side line in croquet 'extras': selling equipment and tee shirts and promoting celeb- rity events. With the weight of experi- ence on their shoulders, not everyone on the governing body of the British game will be sorry to see the tournament taken off its hands. Sponsor- ship for croquet is hard to find - this year's event was only saved by Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Club which stepped in at the eleventh hour to pick up half the costs. Not everyone feels that the USCA is as \"organised\" as it claims. Arkley brushes the criticism aside. \"The USCA right now is in good financial condition,\" he says firmly. \"We've pared our expenses. We still aren't rich in terms of money for sponsorship events but we're ruing our organi.' satton professio y and we're making a profit.\" He says the sport is growing fast in the US. An \"amazing number\" of croquet courts are being built, many as part of retirement housing develop- ments. The USCA has also adapted the British practice of promoting croquet in schools, using the game's tactical aspect as part of the mathe- matics curriculum. Arkley believes this gives the US a growing advantage over the other two great croquet playing nations, Australia and New Zealand. \"The US will be participating in the next Test [in 193] for the first time and there is no doubt that America will be number two to Britain soon, because there are no young players coming into the top level in Australia or New Zea- land whereas we have got a lot of young players.\" The Australians at least seem unruffled. At 36, Mark Kobelt may not be as young as Fulford and Clarke but he is a great example of Australian determination and delight in the game. A sheep shearer from New South Wales, he calls himself \"a small town bushie\" who entered his first official tournament just three years ago. \"The game's bril- liant. It's really challenging and requires such a variety of skills,\" he says. Meanwhile, in France there are now five official clubs. However, Antoine Ravez, Presi- dent of the Federation Fran- caise de Croquet is alarmed that, following a two-page article in Figaro magazine, he has been inundated with enquiries to start clubs. \"Three hundred and fifty in one month,\" he says in shocked tones, adding that he has no intention of letting them all in on the act. \"They are not all serious. We can't waste time with people for whom it is just la mode.\" m The final of the World Cro- quet Championship will be played at the Hurlingham Club, Ranelagh Gardens, London SW6 tomorrow starting at 10 am. Tickets are on sale at the gate at Â£5.50. Lydia van der Moor Hoop-la at Hurlngham: Jerry Stark Is part of the US Invasion \"' F-:d F: i ~j ~P",

This fabulous flight continued with the Mark XI (1948), its successor. It was and is held in such high esteem that current collectors' prices are likely to bring you back to terra tirma in a hurry. Our new pilot's chronograph is the logical consequence of a line of famous predecessors: outstanding exterior styling in the round, the toughness of a true pioneer, and a set of con- struction principles that even connoisseurs of IWC watches wouldn't have thought possible. Characterizing as worlds apart the difference between our pilot's chronographs and other watches aspiring to the same lofty goal, has be- come a virtual tradition to which our new model is happy living up to.

   "text_content" : "T HE FRENCH have taken up golf with a vengeance. The nation that provided the winner of the Open Cham- pionship in 1907 has become besotted by le golf. You only have to attend the LancOme Trophy at Saint-Nom-la-Bre- teche outside Paris this week- end to see that in France, le golf is tres chic. The boom began nearly ten years ago when golf was grow- ing in popularity elsewhere on mainland Europe. Within six years the number of courses in France had doubled. The num- ber of registered players rose from 43,613 in 1981 to 135,146 in 1988. By the start of the 1990s it was hard to avoid the pervad- ing influence of golf - even if it was only a pattern on a tie or a belt or a symbol on a keyring. One hundred and sis- teen courses had been created since 1984, a rate of expansion that matched the extraordi- nary surge in golf-course build- ing that went on in the UK in the late Victorian and Edwar- dian eras. That was odly the half of it. In January 1989 a further 69 golf facilities were under con- struction. Of these, 59 were to be private golf courses. By Jan- uary 1991 there would be 400 courses in France. That was the plan. Unfortu- nately, the reality is somewhat different. France has been hit by the recession. It is not known how many golf courses have closed, are operating at a loss or are for sale in France at present, but it is a lot. One example will suffice. Chateau des Forges Golf & Country Club SA is set amid 200 acres of rolling, wooded countryside 20 miles southwest of Poitiers. In 1989 work was begun on behalf of its Swedish owners to convert the chAteau into an hotel and restaurant and to build 27 holes of golf. \"It was correct at the time\", explained ingemar Hagblom, the finance director. \"There was to have been golf from March to October and after that hunting for wild boar. To come here is very easy. It is very suitable for northern Europeans, particularly when the Channel tunnel is finished. For Johansson and me it gives us the feeling of being at home.\" The cost was FFr8OOm (28m) Little was spared. Tiles from Spain were imported for bath- rooms. The golf office, an attractive sandstone building, was moved from Angouleme, 60 miles away. Nothing was too much trouble or too expensive. It was a pattern of extrava- gance that was being repeated all over the country. The trouble was that not enough golfers came to ChAteau des Forges. Nor were they flocking to many other of France's new projects. The number of people able or will- ing to pay the large member. ship fees was much smaller than had been thought. \"Golf became a buzz word, like ten- nis\", said Charles O'Brien, an Irishman who owns Les Petites Chaumes, a pitch and putt course outside Surgeres, an hour's drive from Chateau des Forges. \"They didn't know what was involved, the amount of money, the amount of main- tenance. It's not like tennis where once a court is done, it's done.\" O'Brien's pitch and putt proj- ect stands on family-owned land, much of it built by the sweat of his own brow. It has survived while many of the more ambitious projects in neighbouring regions have not. Chateau des Forges was hit by the Gulf War. \"Wars can be good for business and can be bad for business\", said Hag- blom. \"This was bad.\" Work fell behind, costs rose, interest rates too. In August, the own- ers sought another FFr20m or they would have to sell The moral is that big is not necessarily better. Small can be beautiful, too. Meanwhile, the men at Chateau des Forges ponder the future. \"I don't know whether we can pull through\", said Hagblom. \"Right now we are just holding our thumbs for the storm ahead\".",

   "text_content" : "Stuart Marshall on a long list of newcomers HE MOTOR industry may be licking its wounds and looking at an uncertain future but you would never suspect it at Frankfurt's exhibition cen- tre this week. The car show which opened there on Thursday for a 10-day run is bigger than ever. There are so many new models on display it seems certain that the entry list for next year's European Car of the Year Award - it will be finalised in a few days time - will be lon- ger than ever. Cars for every conceivable need (and a few inconceivable ones) include a computerised sports car with a theoretical top speed of 192 mph (309 kmh) from Mercedes-Benz that alters shape to suit driving conditions. This road-going experimen- tal car, developed from its World Championship C11 sports-racer, is not for sale. If it were, buyers would find that, like all Mercedes-Benz produc- tion cars, it has been speed limited to 155 mph (250kmh). However, some of its systems are bound to be seen on future Mercedes-Benz cars. Among them are aerodynamic aids to increase downforce when needed to improve braking grip, tyre pressure monitors and active suspension that eliminates unwanted body movement. The thought of any supercar - even if limited to 155 mph - going on sale at all is enough to make many an environmen- talist's or road safety cam- paigner's flesh creep. (At times, mine too). But every- where at Frankfurt there is evidence of the impact of envi- ronmental issues on the car manufacturers. Volkswagen believes that its squeaky-clean Chico concept could form the basis of a new class of car to meet changing social and environmental needs. Chico, only 10 ft (315 cm) long, has semi-sliding doors that are safe and easy to open in confined places and a hybrid power train. In town, it is driven by battery-electric power; in the country, by a 34 horsepower petrol engine with 5-speed gear box. Hybrid, rather than purely electric power, is seen as a realistic option. For city centre use, the short range of an elec- tric car with cheap, conven- tional lead/acid batteries is acceptable and its limited per- formance even desirable. Out of town, an internal combus- tion engine is more practical. Chico switches from one to the other automatically. Volkswa- gen says it could also be made with straightforward petrol or diesel drive trains. BMW's El concept car is purely electric but it has high- energy (and high cost) sodium sulphur batteries. They are so efficient that El has a top speed of 75 mph (120 kmh), gets from 0-30 mph (0-50 kmh) in six seconds and runs for 150 miles (241 km) between six to eight- hour overnight charges. With an aluminium chassis and plas- tic body panels, BMW says El would be simple to recycle when its working life was over. The need to reclaim the materials from which cars are made is a theme among all exhibitors. It is not enough for cars to have reduced emis- sions. Makers boast of the care they take to minimise environ- mental damage caused by the manufacturing process itself. Volkswagen has scored a first by agreeing to take back its all-new Golf (due in Britain next spring) for disposal when its working life is over. This is one car unlikely to be seen dumped by the roadside in the 2010s and after. Other hybrid vehicles are being shown by Britain's Inter- national Automotive Design company and Ford. IAD's chas- sis could be the black cab of 21st century London. The 80 mile (128 km) range of its sodium sulphur battery can be at least doubled by boosting its power with a very small petrol engine. Ford's sodium sulphur battery powered Escort deliv- ery van goes for 100 miles per charge, 250 miles as a hybrid. Back to the immediate future, there is more good news from Frankfurt for buy- ers of large estate cars. Ford is showing its long awaited Scor- pio estate which will be offer- ing competition to Citrodn's new XM load carrier, though not until early next year in Britain. It will be available with 4-cylinder and V6 engines, automatic transmission and air conditioning. UK sales of Mit- subishi's interesting 1.8 litre, multi-valve engined Space Wagon and compact Space Runner multi-purpose vehicles, which are making a Frankfurt debut, start on October 1. Volkswagen claims the Golf is safest in its class and that it is able to meet the rigorous laws to be introduced in the US in 1993. One of the standards for a 35 mph (56 kmh) frontal crash is equivalent to the Golf being dropped on to concrete from a fourth-floor window. It is also, says VW, the first car to be offered throughout Europe with a catalytic con- verter as standard. Though unmistakably a Golf, its styl- ing is rounder than before and the interiors more welcoming. Locking horns with the Golf is Vauxhall's (and Opel's) lat- est Astra, yet another Frank- furt newcomer, which arrives in Britain next month. The Astra - Opel has dropped the name Kadett - is evolutionary rather than revolutionary. But the Astra hatchbacks, saloons and estates look fresh and have some bright and sensible ideas. UNTIL NOW, the blood line of Toyota's family cars ran from from Starlet to Corolla, Carina to Camry. But not any more. The current Camry is a good car; its successor, unveiled at Frankfurt, is even better, because it is a son of Lexus, not a relative of Carina. Lexus is Toyota's up-market brand. The Lexus LS400, 4-litre V8 powered and sepulchrally silent, compares with cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series and Jaguar in everything except price. The latest Camry V6 GX even looks rather like the Â£37,000-plus Lexus LS400 in some respects. It brings similar refinement within reach of buyers with around Â£23,000 to spend. For this they get a medium/large executive saloon with a 3-litre, 185 horsepower V6 engine, automatic transmis- sion, air conditioning, cruise control, ABS brakes, CD player and leather upholstery. In Bavaria last week the Camry V6 GX I tried was almost unnervingly quiet at up to 120 mph (193 kmh) on the autobahn. Hard acceleration made the engine hum musi- cally but wind roar and tyre induced road noise never intruded. It coped comfortably with all kinds of roads and handled with the nimbleness and security Europeans expect of a car of quality. The 2.2 litre, 134 horsepower 4-cylinder engine of the GL (about Â£17,250 when the cars go on sale in Britain on October 16) has to work a little harder but is almost as self-effacing as the V6. Toyota lists 17 class rivals, from Alfa 164 to Saab 9000, BMW 5-Series to Volvo 900 Series. I doubt if any can beat it for a combination of refinement and value.",

   "text_content" : "T O SOME of us the shirt does not seem the most revealing of garments. When clean, crisp and well-chosen we do admit it has a certain charm and some are more charming than others - but deeply mreealing? Well, some of those whose business it is to sell shirts have taken a good, long look at the matter and have their own perceptions of what a shirt is saying about the man who wears it. Charles Tyrwhitt, a young and keen shirt-making com- pany that has a team of pretty sales girls going into some of the grandest offices in the City of London has put together a (light-hearted) guide to what your shirt says about you, based on the observations of the girls themselves. He who wears nothing but white shirts has, it seems, diffi- culty expressing himself and is definitely dominated by his mother. Small stripes, close together, are worn by the tradi- tionalist with conservative tastes, although he is a true gentleman among women. Bold stripes, wide apart, on the other hand, mean that you should take care - the wearer is likely to be very ambitious and competitive, the sort who plays office politics for real. Multi-coloured stripes are for the sexual athlete, he who likes to display his body and enjoys fast living, fast cars and fast women. Put on a pink shirt and you are deemed to be a quiet romantic who savours life's most refined pleasures. The man who wears his sleeves rolled up is likely to be a lager lout, more interested in his Saturday nights than his job. Cufflinks, the girls observed, were the mark of a stylish, sophisticated and charming man. Those who don't wear a tie and leave the top button of a shirt undone are lazy, egotis- tical and slobbish but for some unaccountable reason attrac- tive to women. This type is also keener on payday than the job in hand. The chap who keeps his jacket on all day is insecure, afraid of women and a nuisance in the office, while the man who never wears a jacket is super-confident, authoritative and very aware of his attractiveness to women. Finally, he who wears a cot- ton shirt is a genuine, clean living, down to earth sort of chap who takes care of his appearance and is liked by his work mates, but the chap who still wears nylon shirts is weedy, old-fashioned and has never had a girlfriend. James Meade, one of the leading purveyors of shirts by mail, set about unearthing cur- rent trends in shirt-wearing by stationing two people in the heart of the City with a brief to do nothing but shirt-watch. They discovered that the older and the more high-powered the worker was, the shorter his lunch and the fewer drinks he had. The younger they were, the more they got out and about at lunch-time and the more likely they were to do a little shirt-buying on the way. The shirt spies found that the younger men went for but- ton-down collars, plain col- oured shirts, long sleeves, dou- ble cuffs and often wore their tie loose and the collar undone (as if to indicate they were get- ting down to very serious work). Wall Street-style braces are no longer the thing, nor are Lucia van der Post discovers what a shirt says about a man brightly coloured socks. (Col- our and a touch of individual- ity come from a brightly-pat- terned tie.) Older men, they say, go either for plain-coloured shirts (white or muted shades of blue, pink or cream) or for pin- striped. They like cut away col- lars, long sleeves, double cuffs and do not go for button-down collars, braces or loud socks. Ties are patterned but very conservative. All this may be alarming to those who feel that the role of shirts is simply to play a nice, quiet sartorial role and not to say deep or interesting things about its wearer's inner nature. Perhaps the best way of dealing with this is to con- fuse the signals: be a mother's boy one day, a roaring sexual athlete the next and the ace of go-getting office politicians the next - that'll fox 'em! Charles Tyrwhitt is a small mail order company started by Nicholas Wheeler and Peter Higgins, two former Bain & Co management consultants, with a finely focused aim - to pro- vide the best shirts and service for the money they can. It operates entirely by mail, thus keeping down costs, and guar- antees to send the shirts (if they are in stock) by return. There is a range of 17 classic shirtings, plains and stripes, all in two-fold cotton poplin (the only poplin for any shirt with pretensions to the \"Jer- Kitchen talk Geoffrey Drayton Interiors, the purveyors of splendid kitchen- ware to the designer set sea- tured last week, are to be found at 4, Porter's Walk, Tobacco Dock, London El. myn Street\" accolade), with real mother-of-pearl buttons and (a big USP this) removable brass collar stiffeners. There are back pleats, extra long tails and quite a choice of sleeve lengths with double or twin-button single cuffs. Then there are two Oxford cottons and one country shirt in 80 per cent cotton, 20 per cent wool. All are a standard price of Â£34.50 BUT (and given that Charles Tyrwhitt researches say that the average City type buys 6.1. work shirts year this is worth noting) it gives one free shirt for every four bought, which brings the price down to Â£27.60 each. Charles Tyrwhitt sells a great deal in City offices - it will deliver the same day by bike if necessary - but shirts are posted all over the UK. Write for a brochure to: Charles Tyrwhitt, 32 Faraday Road, Freepost, London W10 5BR. (Tel: 081-968-0319). James Meade has been in the business longer and has a slightly larger range of fabrics, offering 22 different designs as well as regular or cut-away col- lars, single or double cuffs. At the moment its winter bro- chure features some special offers on end-of-lines, offering two-fold poplin shirts at Â£32.50, although the basic price has just risen to Â£40.50. It uses removable plastic stiffeners but sells silver or gold ones for Â£29.50 and Â£125.00. Orders nor- mally go out in a \"week or two\" but can take four weeks. Write to James Meade, 48 Charlton Road, Andover, Hampshire SP10 3JL (Tel: 0264-333222) for a brochure. Thomas Pink is a specialist shirt business that grew rap- idly back in the 80s when niche businesses were booming. It aimed to do what James Meade and Charles Tyrwhitt do - to sell high quality, so-called \"Jer- myn Street\" shirts at competi- tive prices. It took off at once r r L If t e a r a It s e a 1- S a r- be giving away more than you know. . . r- Watch those stripes - they may and expanded into mail order. Fans of Thomas Pink like its range of stripings and there are those who claim that the cut is roomier and the tails lon- ger. James Mullen, one of the three brothers who runs the company, is exceedingly tall and he is said to have created shirts to suit himself. Today it seems to be heading out of mail order (there are no bro- chures available for the pres- ent though existing customers can order more of the same, so to speak) and expanding its retail side. It now has shops at Blomfield Street, London EC2, 35 Dover Street, London W1, Drayton Gardens, London SW10O and 16 Cullum Street, London EC3. It has developed a label sys- tem rather like the Champagne houses. Black label is top of the range and means the shirt is of two-fold cotton poplin, cotton Oxford, pinpoint Oxford ;o or cotton batiste and costs ts Â£39.50. Next comes the Red it label, which signifies single- 2, fold poplin, though the same 1, manufacturing standards, and n sells for Â£29.50.

   "text_content" : "FOR THOSE who feel more at home with chain-store prices than designer labels this is a good year. At Marks & Spencer there really is some excellent value - up-to-the-minute designs have been coupled with good prices, but you need to make it to one or other of the main branches (in one case London's Marble Arch only) and you need to be quick: these sort of high-fash- ion bargains sell out fast. Look for a short swing coat at just Â£89.95. It is what is called an \"edge-to-edge\" coat (that is it has no buttons) and is perfect to wear over the knit- ted looks that are everywhere this autumn. It can look formal for evening and be worn casu- ally over jeans - this season's version, if you like, of the clas- sic. It looks good in white but comes also in a honey colour. For those who like leather - and leather and fake leather was everywhere at the designer collections - Marks & Spencer has a very zippy short swing leather coat, fully- lined, for Â£250. Those in the know will tell you that it looks very like a much more expensive designer number. It is exceptional value - it would probably be double the price anywhere else - so you will have to be quick off the mark. It is only in the top stores, including Marble Arch. Finally - and this one will be only in the Marble Arch branch, in about a fortnight's time - look out for a three-quarter length coat in charcoal grey with an enor- mous black fake fur hood. It has big penny buttons and drawstring at the bottom, is 75 per cent wool, and costs Â£89.95. The parka (above) is a perennial classic design, long appreciated by those who live rugged outdoor lives. In recent years It has come in from the cold and been refashioned In every fabric from fragile silk to tough acrylic. This version by Byblos is an exceptionally luxurious model made from 80 per cent wool and 20 per cent cashmere.

   "text_content" : "F YOU were to take the tree- lined Route Nationale 113 fkrot Bordeaux, centre of the tradi- tional wine world, to the unri- valled concentration of wine bargains that is today's Languedoc, the first vineyards you would come to, after three or four hours bisecting vast sweeps of cereals and sunflowers, would be those of Cabard6s (pro- nounced \"Cab-are-des\"). Here the scale Is altogether differ- ent. Narrow roads, heady with the Mediterranean scents of wild fennel and thyme, dip and dive around patches of vies punctuated by garri- gue and pines. White boulders and rocky outcrops are the more obvious manifestations of geological diver- sity. From them you can see the extraordinary turreted CNti of Carcas- sonne just to the south and, on a clear day, west along the Pyrenees all the way to Laurdes. It looks idyllic and the two dozen wine producers of Cabardes are dedi- cated to keeping it so, but they have a problem. Their export prices are often as low as FFr8 or 80p, per smart ex-chbteau bottle. What brings headaches and near- penury to these vignerons, and thou- sands of others in the Languedoc- Rousllon, is of course a gift to wine consumers. But the unusually cobe- sive, committed and uncomplaining band ofat Cabardsroducers can offer those used to the flavours and dimen sions of red bordeaux something spe- cial: an Introduction to the Langus doe thati not Jut geographical but tasteable. Cabrd, lmot all of it red, tastes like a halfway house between the familiar Cabernets and Merlots of Bordeaux's Atlantic vine- yards and the Languedoc's more Med- iterranean make-up of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsaut and the ubiquitous Carignan vine. A full-blooded St Chinlan or Fiton can come as a bit of a shock to a palate reared on St EstMphe or even Fronsac, but a typical Cabardis has the same sort of weight a a bordeaux and contains a cocktail of \"Atlantic\" and \"Mediterranean\" grape varieties. As Gabriel Tari, a young lawyer who decided to dedicate himself to upgrading his family's ChAteau de Bran says defiantly: \"We don't want to be like the rest of the world mak- Jancis Robinson finds bags of character and bargains among the wines of Cabardis ing Just another wine that tastes like His property Is in the south-eastern sector of the region where, as one would expect, the Mediterranean varieties predominate and the wines, such a those of garlanded ChAteau Salitis, taste rounder, riper and fuller as a result. Another of the region's bigger properties, and probably the most widely available, Is the historic ChAteau de Pennautier - Mollere stayed ,here - whose holdings Include vineyards pread widely over Cabardis' varied subregions. ChAteau de Pennaunter 1987 Is Just Â£2.90 at sainsbury's and the much riper 1989 is Â£3.49 at Peatlings, London ECi and Z et Ami&a a d 98.4 at HaM H im- san aa Clark at SW6. Te very Cabernet wines are also shpped from this tiny vine outpost to Sn Pran ciwo. Patrons of Britain's Majestic Wine Warehouses may well be familiar with the wines of ChAteau de Von- tenac. Owner Alain Maurel is most proud of the 1989 red at Â£2.99. Wal- tro sell his Domane Leclaud Caber- net 1989 for Â£2.95 - a much better buy than the muddy, blended Cabardbs Waitrose stock at Â£2.79. The more acid soils of Ventenac on the west, more Atlantic side of the region make for distinctive reds and delicate roses that express well the unique \"Vin de Deux Mers\" style of Cabardis. The region has been paid the com- pliment of relatively new investment. A talented young winemaker from the Conques co-operative will be making his own first vintage at La Ventalolle this year and Domaine des Caunettes-Hautes, also in the west, is the result of hard work on the part of the Rouquet brothers prevously in the ereal business. Their attzat vely .yrah-influened 1989. Is 8.49 at Unwini. Etonk Ellot .of Alderley Ed have the robut t Ch Rivals 198. .On the other side of Careassonne is another VDQS candidate for AC sta- tus and the appellation \"Ideal Intro- duction to the Languedoc\", Ctes de la Malepire. Prices are equally attractive but the region, being wet- ter and more westerly, Is even more Atlantic-influenced and, with the exception of such dedicated individu- als as Henri Turett at the Domalne de Matibat, tends to be much more dominated by big co-operatives than the more indivdualistic Cabardes to the north. As the age of vines in the newly- renovated vineyards of Cabardes increases, and as winemaking exper- tise and equipment improve, the wines of Cabard6s should get better. They are already beautifully pack- aged, looking at first glance almost indistinguishable from a chateau-bot- tied claret costing three times the price. One wonders how many wine buyers have picked a bottle off the shelf thinking that Cabardis is that famous red grape variety they use in Bordeaux.",

   "text_content" : "is a nightmare. Moving your company, when you are in a retail trade such as the restaurant business and depend on loyal customers remembering your front door and telephone number, can be risky. When you decide to move both home and business from Cheam, Surrey, to central Lon- don you must be passionate, desperate or both. The Borgonzolo family, chef Vincenzo, wife and mditresse d' Elaine and daughter Angela, who helps out on busy Satur- day nights, have just com- pleted the move. In mid-July they closed the Cheam restau- rant which they had run for seven years and on Monday will open at 30 Connaught Street, London W2, swapping one flat above the restaurant for another. This time they are hoping for financial rewards as well as culinary plaudits. That they have not achieved such rewards has been the result of circumstance, naivety and geography. Vincenzo came to London from Naples in 1966 to take up his first job as a barman in a Spaghetti House. In southern Italy, he says, 80 per cent of the men cook, although possibly not with the passion that he does. He spent the next seven years teaching himself how to cook better, convinced that this was where his future lay. In 1984, with the help of his mother and sister who gave their house as security, he raised the money to convert 52 Upper Mulgrave Road into a restaurant. The family had seven tables to fill, a Â£23,000 loan to repay and the firm con- viction that London was waiting for their food. Sadly, it was not. In 1984 even central London was obliv- ious to the charms of true Ital- ian cooking Vincenzo began a year before Orso's whetted so many appetites in Covent Gar- den and long before the River Cafd in west London - and others - spread the gospel. a But the Borgonzolos were not in central London but on its r most southern outskirts, where potential customers expected the far more conventional \"British school of Italian cook- I ing\". 3 Vincenzo was not prepared r to make any compromises and i during the 1980s the family struggled. They suffered nights with no customers. It took four i years to build turnover to Â£1,000 a week and to find a formula for the menu and the price that would allow Vin- f cenzo to cook every dish to order and his customers to leave happy. Looking over a recent menu this struggle is not such a sur- r prise. There is no pasta in the - first courses but there is r risotto with saffron, parma r ham and parmesan; rabbit pan t fried with sun-dried tomatoes; t Nicholas Lander on a restaurateur I who moved lock, v stock and barrels a and an earthy fried potato cake with goose salami. There is no 3 escalope of veal milanese in the main courses but monkfish cooked in silver foil with cour- t gettes; loin of pork with three g kinds of beans and truffle oil; and quails with an apple and Schestnut sauce. Among an eclectic range of i desserts was an extraordinary \" dish of aubergines dipped in \" dark chocolate layered with 2 almonds and mixed peel that i was as exciting as the dates I stuffed with marzipan, rolled ) in pistachio nuts and served with a plum sauce. s Very favourable reviews in 1986 and 1987 removed some I financial pressure - they sen- - sibly send every good review to their bank manager - and i convinced them that location, a rather than skill, was the big- gest impediment to success. r At weekends they looked I over Barnes, Wandsworth and . up and down Fulham Road.

   "text_content" : "OVER the last week or two local newspapers all over France have been publishing the rates of pay agreed for this season's grape harvest. A typical communique issued for the Ande and Herault departements is revealing. Those who cut grapes off the vine are paid Â£8.30 an hour, plus two litres of wine for every eight hours' work, while those who empty or carry the containers into which the grapes are cat are paid slightly more per hour plus three litres of wine every eight hours. Wine lovers should be heartened that those at the sharp end should in theory at least be clearer-headed than those who merely fetch and carry but Claude Evin, the French health minister, who has achieved warning notices on all wine advertisements in France, must presumably be appalled by this generous payment In kind.

   "text_content" : "\"A SOCIALIST Dogma in the Dustbin,\" said the headline in Libem- ion. It turned out to be about a pro- posed tax cut on distributed profits, something President Mitterrand had promised never to do. The association of dustbins, or oubliettes as the headline actually said, with socialism, is a common theme in the European press but above all in France. There it poses enormous problems, partly because the Socialist Party is the party of gov- ernment and it feels it should take its title seriously. One of its unfortunate traditions is incarnated in the phrase \"No enemies on the Left.\" Thus not only did Presi- dent Mitterrand offer what seemed to be almost a guarded welcome to the coup in Moscow last month, but Jac- ques Delors, President of the Euro- an Commion and poble next leader of the o Party, gave a interview to the weekly, L'zwress, which appeared just aer the cowp failed. In it he said \"If the new Soviet leaders maintain themselves in powr, them cold be postive aspects in calmir natgia st paIsim S\" The party beieves it ba con- tinue to advocate socialist pocia but, as the above show t is always ruaning into difielties I da with s .

   "text_content" : "RABELLA BOXER'S A is a quiet voice of calm and sanity in today's hyped-up foodie world where interna- tionalism runs amok and too many cooks look for applause instead of aiming to please. Her first book, First Slice Your Cookbook, published in 1964, was written as a protest against the fashion for elaborate, pretentious and over-rich foods. Her recipes then, and since, have been remarkable for their use of ingredients that are the best of their kind. Her aim is always to show off good foods, not to show off the cook. Her latest book, due out next week, laments our national tendency to decry and neglect our own foods and to lavish praise on other nations. \"The English are a strange mixture of complacency and insecurity, for they genuinely don't seem to value their own culinary inheritance,\" she writes. She sets out to restore a bit of proper British pride in good English cooking by describing the \"brief flowering of excellence\" in English food that took place in British society between the wars; a discreet revolution in food as Edwardian pomposity and formality faded and uncomplicated elegance took its place. Alas the- advent of the Second World War nipped this in the bud. Arabella Boxer's Book of English Food (Hodder & Stoughton Â£16.95) is a great deal more than a recipe book. Laced with quotes from contemporary diaries, letters and cookbooks; drawing on memories of her own childhood and the reminiscences of family and friends, she describes country house style and that of the great and ambitious hostesses of the time. Vivid pictures emerge of the parties they gave and of family meals; the changing menu patterns that evolved; how, where and what hour meals were served in the upper echelons of British society in the 1920s and 1930s. It makes fascinating and very appetising reading. The sunny lure of Mediterranean cooking seems unlikely to dim but.this .book, with its celebration of good English foods,oghto to some way tbwards dressT g the balance. ROAST SADDLE OF LAMB Rarely seen nowadays, except at guildhall dinners, this is, as Boxer says, one of the glories of the English kitchen. In pre-war days it would often have been a saddle of mutton*, which has a character all of its own. But a saddle of well-reared lamb is also a marvellous dish. Allow roughly 1 Ib per person. Saddle of British lamb, approx 6 lb; 3 tablespoons best olive oil; 1 tablespoon lemon jauice; 6 branches of tarragon and 3 of chervil (optional); % pt lamb, beef, veal or chicken stock. Virtually nothing needs to be done to this joint, except paying for it, before putting it into the oven. In spring and summer when the lamb is young I rub a little virgin oil all over it, sprinkle over a few drops of lemon juice and some freshly ground black pepper, and lay branches of tarragon and chervil all over. In winter, when the lambs are older and fresh herbs hard to come by I merely rub it with oil, lemon and pepper. Lay the joint on a roasting rack and cook for 1 %-1'% hours, whatever its weight, at 350'F/IWC, gas mark 4. It does not need basting since it is completely covered with its own fat. When the time is up, move the joint on to a carving platter and cover it loosely with foil and a heavy cloth. Stand it in a r: Refrigerate the skinned tomatoes until well chilled. To make the sauce, fold together the mayonnaise, whipped cream and horseradish, and -chill. lightly. At the-.last- moment, thia the sauce with a drop of milk to' achieve a 9pboning cOisistency, and pour it over the tomatoes. BROAD BEANS WITH ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS Boxer points out that this utterly delicious dish Would probably have been served on its own, after the main course, in the 1930s, but it works well today as a first course. 1 lb shelled broad beans (allow 3 lb to 4 lb in their pods); 3 artichokes; 1 oz butter; % pt chicken, veal or vegetable stock; 1% tablespoons chopped chervil (optional). Cook the beans in salted water. Boil the whole artichokes separately, for 40-45 minutes, then drain well. Discard the leaves and choke. Cut the artichoke bottoms into small dice. Melt the butter in a pan. Add the vegetables. Cook for a moment or two then add the stock and seasoning. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time. Do not stir or you will break up the beans. Turn into a serving dish, sprinkle with chervil when available, and serve as soon as possible. *Limited supplies of genuine mutton, the meat of Shetland cross Wensleydale sheep, carefully hung for two weeks, are available from Heal Farm, Kings Nympton, Umberleigh, Devon EX37 9TB, this autumn. Whole and half saddles weigh approximately 10 lb and 5 lb respectively. For further information telephone Ann Wilson on 076-574341. warm place for 15-20 minutes before; carving; this is very important. While the meat rests, make the gravy. Heat the stock in a small pan and pour off the fat in thei roasting tin. .Stand the tin over a moderate flame. Add the hot stock to the tin, scraping and stirring until all the ciramelised meat juices amalgamate with the stock. Let it all bubble away and reduce for a few minutes, then strain into a sauceboat. Although saddle is a good-looking joint, it is perhaps easiest to carve in the kitchen. It must be cut parallel to the bone, in long strips, about % inch thick on the outside, tapering slightly as they *ueet the bone. If too long, they may be cut in half to serve. Sometimes the whole saddle is slightly concave, making it very hard to carve. In this case cut the whole joint across in half with a strong knife then carve as above, in shorter strips.

   "text_content" : "T HAD rained persistetly in the night and an occasional drop of U watertill w plummeted heavily on to 'the ftriablebut bare woodland floor as I left my tent to go to the bush shower. But the view from the beach caused me to abandon all thoughts of ablu- tions and to skip back for, my camera. Immediately in front of the camp Forest Lagoon reflected, in needle-sharp perfec- tion the gnarled fang of Mount Rugby. I could almost touch the summit of the image from the glittering white quartz beach on which I was standing. The new- ly-dawned sun lit every detail of the lone mountain and the only breaks in its mir- ror image came from the wakes of three black swans crising across the bay. What a contrast to my cold, cloud-heavy arrival on the previous afternoon. The camp, run by Bob Geeves Wilder- ness Tours, lies deep in Tasmania's South West National Park, a wilderness area more than Im acres in extent and without a single road. I had flown here straight from Britain - a comfortable 22-hour Qantas flight to Melbourne was followed by a flight to Hobart and on, by light aircraft, to the dirt strip at Melaleuca. Bob Geeves met us there in his aluminium boat and we followed the tortuous channel to his camp totally concealed in the woods on the edge of Forest Lagoon. The tents, pitched among the trees, have airbeds and down sleeping bags and the site boasts a good bush toilet as well as a shower. Tasmania's weather is unpredict- able and frequently wet and so the rather rbby kitchen and dining areas and their fires are protected by waterproof fly sheets, their ceilings black with tar depos- its, while the lingering woodsmoke quickly impregnates clothes with its smell. Tasmania is said to resemble Scotland in more ways than just its changeable weather. The peaty soil and button grass moorland are very reminiscent of the Highlands although the occasional ground parrot, a green bird about the size of a thrush with a long tail, which sprang from my feet to fly a short distance before alighting again, told a different story. In more open areas the peat was pocked with the mouse-sized holes of yabbies, small crayfish which spend the day under- ground, emerging at night to search for food. It was here that we found the paired red fronds of forked sundew and fairies aprons, the delicate purple flowers of the bladderwort. Generally, though, the button grass was reinforced by dense woody plants, Tasma- nia's equivalent of heather but often thigh deep and extremely tiring to walk through. Unlike the well trodden uplands of Britain, there are rarely paths here for this is wild country. It was a point brought home to us on the day the outboard failed to start. The seri- ous problem of a cross-threaded plug was too difficult to fix in the bush and Bob had to make a two-hour walk back to the air- Tasmana Is M to r1em0 Sommn i mone way mn p Is mCngeme wImner Â·Â· : i ; :Â· ~: Â· :.Â·Â·'jcÂ· :.,Â·Â·Â·~~Â·Â·Â·. '.` Â·~.-: strip to seek help. If he did not return within six hours then we, too, were to walk out. Our isolation and vulnerability suddenly became very real. It came as a surprise, then, on the fol- lowing day to find we had no experienced leader for our walk up the 3,000 ft peak of Mount Rugby. Instead, with instructions to follow the path marked by cairns and tapes tied to bushes, Bob Geeves deposited us by boat at the bottom with a promise to retrieve us at 4 pm. My companion, a retired GP from Syd- ney, and I set off at a steady pace, clim- bing beside a eucalyptus forest, now and then disturbing a parrot and watching, for a few magic moments, a pure white bird of prey, a goshawk, as it rode the thermals. It swung our way and, as it swept past I could see the goshawk's yellow hooked bill and the glint of its eye. It seemed almost ethereal, like the spirit of a past explorer doomed to float effortlessly over the ter- rain. From the saddle of the mountain the increasingly faint path led ever more steeply upwards until suddenly the slope eased and we emerged from the dense veg- etation on to the summit. From here the view, on this sunny day, was simply magnificent - ranges of mountains like rows of dog's teeth merged into the distance while the Southern Ocean beat incessantly against cliffs in the opposite direction. Below us the only mark of man's hand, or rather his feet, was the faint white line of one of the long distance tracks in the national park. Walkers, dropped at one end, are collected several days later from the other by boat or aero- plane. In between they have to be entirely - self-reliant and, in spite of a variety of modern technical wheezes to reduce: weight, their packs always looked enor- mous to me. But our own troubles were about to begin. Although we located the tape at the start of the path down, the second one eluded us. It was like being lost in an - enormous block of 7ft high privet hedge. It was dense, growing on a slope so steep that it was impossible to climb without using your hands. Scattered among it are boulders as big as trucks, each liberally studded with razor sharp quartz crystals. Underneath some were crevices and cav- ernous hollows. Up and down we strug- gled, finally emerging over an hour later, cut, scratched and with torn clothes, on to' our path. It is the only time I have taken longer to come down a mountain than ascend it. But the wilderness also has a kinder, more beautiful, face. On the morning of my departure, we set off on the early tide for the airstrip. The water was smooth and black and the hurrying boat shattered the reflected sky into shards and left the mountains shaking and shimmering in its wake. To take 29 hours from Heathrow to Wil- derness Tour's base camp may be fast but it is not to be recommended. Tasmania's capital, Hobart, makes a good stopping point. The city and its surroundings are rich with the remains of convict settle- ments of the last century and villages such as Richmond have been preserved almost intact. At Brighton, just round the corner from Bridgewater, the Bonorong Wildlife Park enables you to see some of Australia's unique mammals and birds at close quar- ters while, in the summer, some 8,000 short tailed shearwaters, which nest on the cliff tops at Clifton Beach Coastal Reserve, can be watched as they return to their nests. They flap in at dusk like a crowd of hawking bats while human seals surf among the waves below until it is too dark to see. m Information: Michael Woods flew to Wil- derness Tours' Camp with Par Avion, its passengers thoughtfully provided with headsets so the pilot can give information about the terrain over which they are fly- ing.

   "text_content" : "AD WE known the tempera- ture would reach WC (121T), we might have given Mount Magnet a miss. On the other hand, there is something satisfyingly appropriate - even if masochistic - about tasting extremes in the Murchi- son Goldfield of Western Australia. I was inspired by a George Haynes painting of a vermilion road entitled \"Drawn to Magnet\" - oh, yes. So we packed everything, including a psy- chotic Doberman, into my '72 Holden Kingswood which, having neither air- conditioning nor shock absorbers, greatly enhanced the discomfort. Heading north from Perth you soon leave behind things like traffc lights, yuppies, beer in glass bottles, McDon- aid's, and enlightened attitudes towards women. It is not that outback towns lack modern trappings: Magnet has a video store, although admittedly no phar- macy, so you can get imovies but not medicine. Neverthels, the Murchison belongs to some indefinable past decade of hard living, unabashed chauvinism, and take-us-as-you-find-us amiability. Here nobody grovels to tourists, but drivers wave because you are a friend on a lonely road. Great Northern Highway remains true to its name in direction only. Above Wubin, the last wheat commu- nity, it narrows, so cars must pass half- off the road. From now on every pub is a must, being the last for a long way. Big butterflies sailed the verandahs. The cool dark bar had one toothless customer. He related his sexual history to my companion as if he had known him forever, while I studied a hand- written list on the wal, of 24 reasons \"Whiy eer is Better Than Women\", a2 of which were lewd. Number 19 was \"Beer do't demand equaity.\" Outside, in a northauterly like the bat of a giant hairdrier, the man with no teeth said Wubin's official weatherreorder keep the thearomoe tar in her lounge.

I What Tom Payne found at the turn of D the century was gold of course. What you find today is an isolated roadhouse 1 containing the typical roadhouse visil tors' book - a myriad proud snapshots of trucks. Rumour suggests owner-driv- ers value their prime-movers far above i possessions such as wives. In jars on a shelf were dead death adders and cockroaches the size of Mars B bars. The barmaid said bigger ones inhabited the fridge. A truckle said a cockroach once carried off one of his chips. Barmaids and truckles are utterly convincing.

We bhad a shower - which would not run cold - at the caravan site which was mre a miners' shbanty-town, with caravans n a circle like a wagon- train.

The list of attractions chalked up outside included \"Beautiful Brenda\" on Wednesdays. The pub was packed. There were no women except the Skimpies - barmaids in crop-tops and knickers. The windows were mended with sticky-tape; the ceiling was made of pressed biscuit tins. The air was blue and vibrant and, as a bonus, the police were attending a brawl. With the minimum temperature 35'C sleep was hard. We camped in a white dust-bowl between orange rock out- crops. Here were some healthy kanga- roos - big reds, and their greyer females called blue fliers. But every- where was death - near the tent, a baby feral camel's skeleton, and a mum- mified roo boxing at the sky. It is the djdd vu of the desert. North of Mount Magnet the highway crosses a dry salt lake where the uncommon and curious dunna-dunna grows. It is related to hibiscus but looks like green coral candelabra. Last cen- tuory when alluvial nuggets were found, the lake became known as the bIsland of At that time, between here and Meek- atharra stood a town named after a reef of gold. Day Dawn. The town had seven hotels, a soft drinks factory, its own newspaper, pot ls, race course, hos- pital, railway station, and 3,000 people.

Meekatharra, however, has the Wild West atmosphere that pervades many surviving gold towns. You expect shot bandits to fall from the wooden-railed balconies. But today's outlaws, accord- ing to one miner we met, are men run- ning away from spousal maintenance obligations. Although he too had fled north from a vengeful wife, he was pleased the percentage of women in Meekatharra had increased slightly. He also praised the Meeka bikies, tradi- tional baddies, who at Christmas held an \"orphans' party\" for anybody who had nobody - which meant nearly everybody. I shared my roadhouse shower with Sseveral frogs. You have to admire the resourcefulness and endurance of Mur- chison residents, animal and human. After just three days we were reduced to tippling Staminade to replace lost mineral salts and energy. The streets burnt the feet of our city-soft Doberman I while Meekatharra mongrels swaggered by like canine gunfighters. However much you drink your thirst remains rabid in this stupendous heat. Flies by the dosen drank from our eyes where they seemed to get intoxicated, for we could roll them away like cur- rants. Back at Mount Magnet it was the 14th consecutive day over 45'C. We spotted what looked like a raincloud in the west, decided to head for it, and ran straight into the final fling of Cyclone Daphne. It was like driving into a titanic car-wash. The blond hills of Ger- aldton were glad \"Sun City\" had been dry for five months. Later I. rang the Weather Bureau to find how far the dying Daphne spread her charity.

   "text_content" : "Carlton Gate In west London: scaled down to meet a changed market N OI' A single British bank could be found to join the line-up of funders for Carl ton Gate, London, W9, three years ago when Declan Kelly set out to create the larg- est single residential development in west London since the 1930s. As it turned out, their caution saved them from having to join the protracted negotiations between banking syndicate members when Declan Kelly's company later went into liquidation. After Declan Kelly's collapse, bank syndicate leader Security Pacific Euro Finance and its funding partner Eagle Star did manage to hold together the Â£59m project finance facility raised for site purchase and initial building costs for proposed redevelopment of the for- mer St Mary's Hospital site near the Regent's Canal on the edge of Maida Vale. However, the 282-apartment first- phase that is now completed is subtly different from the one envisaged in 1988. As construction work progressed, the flats were scaled down to meet a changed market. The first sales cam- paign in the Far East emphasised the lavish scale of the 2,000 sq ft pent- houses, the integral residents' leisure centre and the planned artificial lakes turning the 10-acre site into an exclu- sive waterside campus. Launch prices averaged Â£250 a sq foot, and the initial sales programme produced encouraging numbers of advanced purchases off- plan. Three years on, and Stephen Gal- pin, the sales director of Carlton Gate Development Company, talks of the scheme in terms of \"value for money\". Seventy-five of the 282 flats have been sold and are now occupied. Purchasers have exchanged contracts on a further 50 units and 19 more are reserved. Roughly half the sales and reserva- tions date back to the pre-sale era. Now, as Stephen Galpin explains, \"construc- tion styles have been adapted to the market. Initially, the sales were all of much bigger apartments with prices in the Â£350,000, Â£400,000 range.\" As the market turned and as buyers disappeared from sales agencies' lists, interest in these mid- and upper-priced flats largely evaporated. As in London Docklands, developers with large area flats found that they could sell the occa- sional smaller studio properties, but that an invisible price barrier formed at Â£200,000, or so. Carlton Gate was able to adapt designs to this increasingly price-sensi- tive, rather than space-conscious, demand because the scheme was not completed. Given the financial back- ground to the development, the sales team was also able to take a more real- istic approach to prices. Asking prices in many completed but unsold developments across London have been held firm for no other reason than to give notional comfort to financ- ing banks that the value of their loan security has not reduced. That helps to explain the number of projects where developers have become reluctant land- lords, furnishing and temporarily rent- ing apartments rather than accepting the writedown in capital values that would occur if they did reduce asking prices to current market levels. At Carlton Gate, the concentration on smaller apartments and an across-the-board reduction in prices bringing average costs down to Â£210 a foot, is backed by buyers incentives that include a zero per cent mortgage loan facility for up to 90 per cent of an apartment's value for a year. Most of the recent purchasers have been taking advantage of that offer, according to Galpin, but he confirms that cash buyers, or those arranging their own finance, can haggle over ask- ing prices now ranging up from Â£89,500. \"We are willing to consider discounts, but we are taking a fairly hard line. We believe that the days of the big dis- counts are over. Sensible pricing is the name of the game now, and we believe that we have made prices competitive.\" Current buyers are being offered free membership of the nearby tennis club as compensation for the temporary lack of the promised leisure centre. But Carl ton Gate does intend to get that centre, complete with residents' pool, up and running shortly. As for the equivalent- sized second phase of the development, Galpin says: \"I would not want to see construction on that underway until we have completed sales here.\" Later this month Carlton Gate intends to adopt a sales strategy that is uncommon in Britain in that it will invite any established estate agency to act on its behalf for a pre-agreed three per cent commission. At the outset, Declan Kelly appointed Brian Lack & Partners and Hamptons as joint sales agents. Under the new regime Cluttons are acting as overall marketing advisers to the development company. Brian Lack remains one of the contracted agencies, along with Harrods Estates, Foxtons Residential and Chestertons Residential. As an \"open to all\" arrangement, an unlimited number of agencies may soon add Carl- ton Gate to their instructions list. \"It is a departure for this country,\" says Galpin, \"but my feeling is that on a development of this size it is logical to assume that no one agent can satisfy the demand for applicants, so why pre clude any properly constituted agency that can help us?\" The 125-year leases offered with the apartments seem to have satisfied the current crop of buyers. But with man- agement fees yet to be established and the Commonhold regulations on the immediate horizon, one evident benefit of buying now may well be an early right to buy in an effective freehold. However, it seems that the average London flat buyer has yet to show an avid interest in the Lord Chancellor's deliberations on property tenure. \"It takes a long time for public perceptions of the new law to filter through,\" says Galpin. \"No-one has raised the point yet. But we have been seeing a quite good change in the market as a whole in the past six weeks with a lot more people willing to come and view and to talk.\"",

   "text_content" : "John Brennan on a more accurate guide to home transfers THE MISSING link in most discussions about the residential property market has been a common standard of measurement to show the trends in the volume of homes sales. It is sales turnover, not prices, that really shows whether the market is alive or dead. Now, thanks to a piece of statistical detective work in the Stamp Offices and District Land Registries, a substantially more accurate guide to the number of home transfers has been made available. Until now the only generally available figures for housing transactions have been based on reports of the number of new mortgages granted. Those figures exclude cash buyers and include remortgages. By adding the number of \"particulars delivered\" to Stamp Offices and Land Registry offices and stripping-out commercial property deals, it is possible for government statisticians to produce figures for housing transfers nationally and regionally that are, normally, no more than a month out of date. The main benefit of any such series of figures is to identify trends. In this instance, the sales volume figures chart the rise and fall of the residential market with an accuracy that no average price indicators can match. Even in the least confident periods for home buying there are a million or more non-discretionary moves. People die, people divorce, families outgrow their homes, they move jobs, they decide that they can no longer stand their neighbours. It is on the broad margins of the market, among the home owners and would-be home owners who may or may not decide to buy a house or flat, that the pressure of demand has the most direct impact on values. Throughout the 1980s sales volumes on the margin responded, as one might expect, with mortgage rate * changes. Sales slowed in 1980, and especially in the third quarter of the year, as loan rates rose to 15 per cent. The subsequent house price upturn is marked in the steady rise in sales activity, with a dip in 1985 when rates increased temporarily. The race to buy ahead of the withdrawn of double f mortgage tax relief in the autumn of 1988 was followed by an immediate dip in sales, from 583,000 to 505,000 in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The gradient of the charts is steadily downward after. However, first and second quarter sales transactions this year, running at 338,000 and 322,000 respectively, none too different from the totals recorded in the last two quarters of 1990.

   "text_content" : "IGHTY YEARS ago to the month, Violet Lady Powis looked out of the windows of her Welsh castle and complained to her journal that the garden looked a mess. Everywhere, she saw the \"failure which results from leaving the garden entirely to the gardeners.\" Those of us who have tried to run a garden with a gardener who is active while we are absent will recognise her ladyship's complaint. However, the remark has rebounded. Since 1972, the gardens of Powis Castle have risen to near the top of the list of Britain's best. The cause is not some elegant lady- owner with chiffon wrapped round her summer straw-hat. It is the result of returning the garden to its gardeners - after a change in per- sonnel. In the garden shop at Powis, I met the genius of the place, James Hancock, head gardener for the past 20 years to the property's owner, the National Trust. Hancock proba- bly knows his reputation, but he cannot have known how I knew it, too. Before going west, I had held a straw poll of garden managers. The straw was well rotted and the poll was conducted in extreme confiden- tiality by phone. All those ques- tioned gave the same answer. the National Trust's outstanding head gardener is Jimmy Hancock, up on the Welsh borders. He has brought the place to life: he even dares to leave his dahlias in the ground all winter. In the garden shop, some enviable fuchsias keep company with rare forms of salvia and make a plantfin- der's fingers itch. Half an hour with Hancock made matters seem clearer - and not quite so simple. There is no disputing the quality of the gar- dens at Powis. JThey fall down the castle's embankment in a series of steep terraces whose origins are his- toric Abut whose planting is thor- oughly modern. The colours have been planned with a touch of genius; the range of plants would stretch any specialist's knowledge; the planting and placing of the gar- den's pottery is an inspiration. It is a bracing site to visit. Until the Trust installs a garden ski-lift, you have to remember that what goes down must eventually come up. Terrace succeeds terrace, leading you down from the temper- ate border, past the orangery and yet more borders to the old walk of apple trees, a border of vivid phloxes and a garden on the flat which is perhaps the least success- ful part. If you then look back, you see the hanging gardens of Wales: Babylonian in their wonders, but a steep ascent to the normal exit past the last of the fuchsias in their terra cotta urns. The Hancock years at Powis have seen a fundamental change. When the National Trust took over in 1952, the gardens were one of many whose borders were designed by Graham Thomas, the Trust's adviser in that hectic era. They took on the usual Thomas contours, but missed a trick on the way. The micro-climate at Powis is peculiar, up against the steep cliff which retains the castle's terrace. The upper borders are dry and shel- 'I held a straw poll of garden managers and all gave the same answer: Jimmy Hancock of Powis is the National Trust's outstanding head gardener' tered; the soil becomes richer and unusually fertile as you descend. The Thomas plantings mixed his usual favourites, but the drought- loving forms were not separated into beds of their own. In 1971, Hancock arrived from a very different background. He had begun by training in the Cambridge Britannic Garden; more recently, he had run the gardens of two large hospitals, one in Wakefield and one in Bristol. A health authority, he explained to me, is an unusual employer: it does not supervise its head gardener very closely and he does not have a committee or self-styled expert breathing down James Hancock, had gardener at Powls, the 'hanging gardens of Wales' his neck. Thanks to the NHS, Han- cock worked out his own trials and errors. At Powis, the inter-relationships were different. Graham Thomas remained, importantly, as a consul- tant; his post had passed to John Sales, still the Trust's supremo, who helped Hancock to make a crucial decision. Together, they began to separate the borders according to their micro-climates. Temperate, drought-loving plants would go on the upper walk, while the day lilies, bergamot and anemones would go in the lower borders, where the rich soil made them grow furiously. Within the older Thomas frame- work, the Hancock era now found its mission. Colours were shuffled round; the borders lost much of their purple and stale colouring, which made them seem slightly off, like a piece of the National Trust tea shop's local cake. Instead, the terraces gained a new, vibrant life. When you enter, you face an amazing range of half-hardy plant- ing, daisies, heliotropes, and weird and marvellous salvias, arranged with particular artistry. Lower down, you are in a world of agapan- thus and rare .herbaceous plants, where Clematis Pearle d'Azur frol- ics like a huge border-plant on an iron frame. No'two plantings seem alike: no terrace repeats the good ideas of another one above it. Here, it emerges, is one part' of the Hancock philosophy: why repeat a good idea instead of aiming at another? The unsupervised mas- ter of hospital gardens soon took the spade into his own hands. His hallmark to my eye are his half-hardy, transient plantings, grouped in the urns and upper ter- races of Powis with a flair which I have never seen bettered. Perhaps you know Salvia Confer- tiflora and the blue-flowered cacali- ifolia; perhaps you grow the hardy Fuchsia Preston Guild and keep swathes of pale pink diascias in your garden urns. Hancock consid- ers he was lucky not to inherit a historic garden like Sissinghurst, whose tradition had to be honoured. His staff has been built up to at least seven gardeners and, together with Sales, he has created the out- standing modern public garden in his own style. As for the.dahlias, the stories are true. Mo*flfbo the dahliasn ,4 Powis have sat in the ground fo1St years and survived the winters with a covering of straw, although the site is not unduly sheltered. Go and see them this month, and wonder why we all lift our tubers religiously and store them for the winter in sheds. Habit and brainwashing, Hancock replies with a twinkle: how, though, have his own habits been formed? Within the Trust, he has the advantage that many good plants circulate between gardens. He travels, looks carefully, and reads catalogues. He is a champion of green leaves and contrasting forms, just like any over-educated designer. He also has a natural style and eye: most of us are not so lucky. Public service is often supposed to be deadly to instinctive taste, a one-way route to hanging baskets and bursts of Britain in Bloom. At Powis an individual eye has turned this prejudice on its head for 20 years. The one cloud is retirement, not so far off at the compulsory age of 65. Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Hancock does not expect to be left to continue in the garden which he has brought to life. I have an alternative suggestion. We should wrap him up, give him a senior citizen's rail ticket, and loan him to historic gardens throughout Europe. Here, if anywhere, is the person who could show the Europeans how to make the most of their climate and bring their historic designs to a proper style."

   "text_content" : "T IS bulb-planting time again - but there is no need to be in a rush to get everything in at once. Some bulbs start to grow much earlier than others: colchi- cums and autumn flowering cro- cuses and also the white madonna lily, ilium candidum, are already starting to grow in the shops and, for best resuts, should have been planted at least a month ago. It is not always easy to get bulbs as early as that in garpen centres but specialist bulb' uirseries do send them out at the right time. Daffodils and narcissi (which are the same thing although daffodil is most frequently used as a name for the trumpet-flowered varieties and narcissus - which'is the botanical ippe for all kinds of daffodil - is reserved in a popular sense for the short-cupped kinds) need priority since none has a long resting sea- son. Those that are left In the ground will be found to be making new roots in August although there is no sign of growth above ground, nor will be for some months. In contrast tulips rest for several months and nothing is lost by keep- ing them out of the ground until October. Naturally-treated hyacinths also remain dormant until then but many hyacinth bulbs are specially heat-treated for win- ter flowering and these need to be back in the soil quickly... Depth of planting. in my view makes little difference except in the case of some lilies which make roots both above and below their bulbs. These need to have three or four inches of soil above the bulbs so that there is ample depth for the upper layer of roots. With all other bulbs it is sufficient to have an inch or so of soil over the bulbs which have a habit of adjusting according to their liking. The idea that each kind of bulb has a fixed level in the soil is untrue. There is also a great deal of mis- understanding about the replanting of bulbs. Most hardy kinds can be left undisturbed for years and it is more for the gardener's conve- nience than for the good of the plants that some kinds tend to be lifted and replanted annually. This is particularly true of tulips and hyacinths which are much used for temporary display in beds and also in window boxes and containers. Daffodils grown primarily for cut flowers and exhibition may also be transplanted - but usually only every three or four years to prevent overcrowding and maintain the quality of the flcwers. But I have daffodils naturalised in grass that have been in the same place for 20 years and it would be a big task to transplant them. They ,still flower freely and are a wonderful sight in spring. They do not spread as they used to and I have no doubt that transplanting would now be .desir- able if I had time and energy to undertake it. Under the broad heading \"bulbs\" one tends to include all plants with fleshy storage organs whic i may technically be corms or tuiers, Among these are hardy cyclamen which are often offered for sale as dry tubers although it is not atgood way In which to buy them. Better by far to buy growing plants in containers. Then they can be planted with minimal root distur- bance at any time of the year. The most popular and easily grown of these plants is cyclamen hederaefolium, with marbled, green and white leaves and small, pink or white flowers in late summer and autumn. To dry out cyclamen and sell them in autumn' is to do them maximum injury. If such. dry tubers of any kind are purchased the best way to restart them is to press the tubers into a bed of moist peat and keep this damp until they begin to form new leaves and roots when they can be replanted where they are to grow. Snowdrops are proper bulbs and can be transplanted while dormant in the autumn. However, they often suffer heavy losses which do not occur if they are moved rapidly while in growth and immediately after flowering in the spring. This method is practicable only when moving them from one part of the garden to another or when purchas- ing from a nursery which is geared up to despatch live snowdrop plants in spring. There are a great many bulbs worth planting. One is the Star of Bethlehem, Ornithogalum umbella- tum, with loose clusters of starry white flowers in spring. It is deco- rative and excellent for cutting. Another is the Spring Star Flower, Ipheion uniflora, with small, bright blue flowers, or white in variety album. There is also an extra deep- coloured variety named Wisley Blue. Few plants have suffered so many confusing synonyms iniclud- ing milla and brodiaea and now, I see, tristagma. For the time being most nurserymen seem to be stay- ing with Ipheion, for which I am glad. Arthur Hellyer",

   "text_content" : "BALLIOL don told the young Roy Jenkins: \"I am not sure how much you know, but you write it in a fine style, which I could not teach you, and which will be of more value to you than anything I could.\" And for all Jenkins's subsequent achievements, that judgment remains pertinent. He writes in a fine style. His autobiography has all the virtues: wit, anecdote, variety, character sketches, gossip and some revelations. It also tells us in his own words why he did not become prime minister. He is a sort of R.A. Butler, a man who in the end did not quite have the will to push quite hard enough for the top. Jenkins was a late developer who did most of his A LIFE AT THE CENTRE by Roy Jenkins Macmillan Â£20, 658 pages serious reading after Oxford and who realised that he might have become leader of the Labour Party only after the chances had largely slipped by. For all his intellectualism, he is also curiously uninterested in ideas. Another quotation comes from his close friend, the late Anthony Crosland: \"What you are pleased to regard as your rational processes seem to me to be just a series of intuitive lurches.\" Then there is Jenkins's own comment on his Oxford experience: he had \"the best of both worlds: Balliol teaching and Trinity living\". In many ways, that sums up his approach to life in general. The main revelation in this book is about his time at the Treasury. He is widely regarded, not least by Margaret Thatcher, as one of the best of the post- war Chancellors. His autobiography shows that it was one long slog. He worked harder than ever before or since. Sterling was almost never out of danger. \"Once a currency has been knocked down into the gutter almost any subsequent event is another vehicle which swishes by and prevents it rising to its feet.\" Jenkins flew - when he did fly - by the seat of his pants. For all his relative successes, his spell as Chancellor was just as difficult as that of James Callaghan before him and Denis Healey some years after. It is striking, and honest, that when he comes to sum up his political life he does not regard his stewardship of the economy as one of his main achievements. It was at the Home Office that he made his mark. Jenkins was a young radical home secretary who, in the mid-1960s, introduced liberalism to the Labour Party. It was under his aegis that the laws relating to abortion and homosexuality were reformed. As he notes, no subsequent government seriously sought to turn back the clock. His disenchantment with Labour was partly personal - his relations with Harold Wilson were seldom good - and partly to do with Europe. Sometimes the two went together. When Wilson became lukewarm about British entry to the Community, Jenkins writes: \"It was like watching someone being sold down the river into slavery, drifting away, depressed but unprotesting\". Jenkins, we now learn, was one of the few people who knew well in advance that Wilson did not want to remain Labour leader indefinitely, yet he admits that he drew the wrong conclusions. Instead of remaining on board to fight for the succession, he himself began to drift off. It was the referendum on British membership in 1975 that drew him more closely into consensual politics. He campaigned for a \"yes\" vote alongside such people as Edward Heath and David Steel. The latter was to be a seminal relationship. Jenkins moved on to become President of the European Commission where he made a brilliantly timed speech that helped to lead to the formation of the European Monetary System. Much of the rest of the time in Brussels, however, was spent nurturing thoughts for political realignment at home. 'Le pas Espagnol', 1899, by Henri Toulouse-Lautree is one of the 443 Illustrations, 39 of them In colour, contained In the book just published by Laurence King, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Drawing by Nicholas Wadley (Â£35) Oddly enough, the chapters on the founding of the Social Democratic Party and the alliance with the Liberals strike me as less interesting than the rest of the book, perhaps because so much is already known. It may be also that by then some of the steel had gone out of Jenkins: it was never his strongest commodity in the first place. Although he makes a strong case against David Owen - a \"nuclear fetishist\" and incapable of working with other people - there was always about the top of the SDP leadership the element of a clique. Perhaps they should have joined the Liberals at the start. Jenkins's final comment on Owen is: \"I cannot but think that the cause of centre politics over the decade of the 1980s would have been better off without him.\" The book has some odd gaps. He scarcely mentions Vietnam, though it did as much as Europe to strain the Labour Party in the 1960s. He does not explain why, as chancellor, he did not support the attempt to reform the law relating to the trades unions, though he makes a mild retrospective apology to Wilson and Barbara Castle. Except on Europe and Home Office reform, he very rarely took a strong position on anything. He also admits to one resentment. When he left the Treasury with plaudits ringing in his ears, he expected to be offered jobs in the City. They did not come. Perhaps they never do to ex-Labour Chancellors. Yet he has always liked writing. His books are a pleasure to read, this one in particular. A new assessment of Attlee is hinted at as his next work. The Chancellor of the University of Oxford has been, and remains, a civilising influence, which was what he set out to be.",

   "text_content" : "RON JOHN is one of the stories collected by the Grimm brothers in the early nineteenth century in which an ancient \"hairy and wild man\" acts as a provoca- tion and guide to a young boy, drawing him into adventures that bring him, after many vicissitudes, to a marriage feast with the Princess. At this point, the doors swing open and a baronial King enters and names himself as Iron John, once the Wild Man held under enchantment at the bottom of a lake, but now freed by the boy's achievement of his sover- eignty. Robert Bly structures his book on this story, following it closely as an image of long-lost but not quite forgotten rites of initiation, in which the events in the tale are symbolic of stages of growth. There are, he says, three kinds of initiation: male, female and human. This one is male and that is why the subti- tle is \"A Book about Men.\" I wondered, heretically, if this story could not also be read as a human initiation, where the boy is everyone who is young and has to leave their family, learn to risk and discover who and what to trust - a hero myth, in fact, valid for all - but, no, Bly insists, this boy is the young male who, in today's particular phase of American culture, is in urgent need of rediscovering what he calls \"the wild man within\" in order to redress an imbalance of our time. Since the Industrial Rev- olution, children rarely work with their parents and so the chance for young men to receive instruction from the elder men is lost. What they lose, of course, are the rituals Ithat separate the men from the boys. Bly's book has had an extraordinary success in the US; it has sold in enormous numbers and American males have apparently been flocking to the forest amidst tales of drumming and tomahawks and group rituals. All this should be set aside if the discussion is to get past the very stereotypes I it is exploring. For a British audience the book and the phe- nomenon are all too easy to parody, and at times difficult not to. The book is not hedged about with our familiar self-de- I precating hmronies, the elliptical qualification and reassuring obliqueness. On the contrary, for Bly met- I aphor is irrepressibly High Noon. But just because of this lack of shadow, his metaphors look more literal than they are and, if they are misread as s directions as to how to live, then the wit is lost, and so is the point. The problem is one intrinsic to addressing any fairy tale outside fairyland: how to allow it simply to extend imaginative possibili- ties rather than to co-opt it as a manual for Real Life. Give it a chance and Bly's unique blend of conversational intimacy and wide-ranging poetic reference may win you over. You may find you have mostly stopped objecting to his IRON JOHN by Robert Bly Element Books Â£12.95. 268 pages categories - wild man, soft man, savage man, inner war- rior,cook, gardener, the sacred king and queen - and have begun trying them out. It could be that one of Bly's intentions is to invite us to think symboli- cally, as might be expected from one who is a poet himself and also the translator of Rilke, Lorca, Neruda and oth- ers - many of them scattered throughout the book. The point is that the book offers a model of how to work with a fairy tale, in the tradi- tion of the mythologist Marie- Louise von Franz, and also Jung, for whom fairy tales were \"the anatomy of the syche.\" So who, then, is the Wild Man who has been exiled from the contemporary psyche? \"The Wild Man is the door to the wildness in nature, but we could also say the Wild Man is nature itself.\" He belongs to the tradition of the Lord of the Animals, the hairy man (Enk- idu in the Epic of Gilgamesh, Esau in the Bible), the Palaeo- lithic Master of the Hunt who in agricultural myth reappears as Dionysos, the god of the vine. (He may also be found in the Green Man - that face wreathed in leaves carved in many a British choir stall.) In ourselves he is there when spontaneity is there - sudden impulses of the heart, reso- nance to nature, desire beyond law. All of us, Bly says, are on a road from the Law to the Leg- ends - from the rule-book of upbringing to that less defin- able place which Bly does not describe except to say that this road cannot be travelled with- out the Wild Man as guide. However, we note that the tale pursues the wild man's trams- formation into Iron John, so the final emphasis rests on the way to live this energy in the world, how to lift the spell and give it a name. Back in the world, I once drove Robert Bly and a friend down to Bristol on a Friday night in early summer. It was a Robert Wy: wild man within small car and Bly was in a hurry - \"You can overtake now\" - as was everybody else who'd had to wait for an hour to get on to the M4. Far more dangerous than his warrior mode was the enchantment of his fairy tales and poems, recited with all the exhilara- tion of his public performances - the Scar Woman, for instance, who ate your scars at death, but if you didn't have any then she ate your eyeballs so you would be blind in the next world. I soon became con- vinced that I would deliver us all into the mouth of the Scar Woman forthwith if I listened to one more story. Just as well he wasn't drum- ming. Jules Cashford",

   "text_content" : "handles the short story in Wilderness Tips with the same assurance that in The Hand- maid's Tale and Cat's Eye she handled the novel. Both the latter were short-listed for the Booker Prize, in 1986 and 1989 respectively. It is time one of Atwood's novels won this prize. And, as is plain in this new collection, Atwood is equally a master of the short story. To describe a woman as a master of anything is, I realise, an accolade obnoxious to semi- nists. It means, or used to mean, a man in authority or control. The point is of more than merely linguistic interest in respect of Atwood's work because the period covered by her stories in this book, the uneasy transitional decades of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, was the period when Canadian women broke free from having to fit into a terminology and a society in which mastery was for men and domesticity for women. No writer has observed what happened to women during those years with greater accuracy. The stories give just as much insight into the contrast between then and now as do the novels, but they do it much more concisely. The lapses of time between past and present, girlhood and womanhood, are here abruptly revealed with lit- tle build-up. They are no less effective for that. The first story, one of the best and most complex, \"True Trash\" is a fine example. It is set in a boys' summer camp on an island 20 miles off-shore from Toronto. As well as the boys whose ages range from 18 to 14 there are nine girls of similar private school background in the camp. They are being paid to be there as waitresses. The waitresses take off their uniforms to sunbathe and swim in an area forbidden to the boys. One enterprising boy - a future Canadian million- aire, we learn - hires out a pair of binoculars. The boys hide in the bushes with the glasses to observe the topless girls. Such rituals of adolescent summer vacation voyeur sex are charted minutely. The girls read aloud to each other from True Romance. They laugh at the crude torrid tales. Some of them start to behave with the older boys, the WILDERNESS TIPS by Margaret Atwood Bloomsbury Â£14.95, 247 pages counsellors, rather like the girls in the magazine. One girl becomes pregnant and deter- mines to have the baby. Eleven years on, some of the girls are now married to the counsel- lors. But the girl who had the baby has disappeared. It is a lot subtler than that brief summary; but it will do to show how we have here a ver- sion of a typical Atwood hero- ine. She is a lost girl, and she appears in various guises in every one of the subsequent stories. In \"Hairball\" - the nastiest - she is a woman magazine journalist stabbed in the back in spite of the bril- liance of her page-design. In \"Isis in Darkness\" - the sad- dest - she is a wispy female cafe poet in a home-made dress. She turns out after her untimely death to have had real talent. In \"The Bog Man\" - the cleverest - she is the research assistant and mistress of an archaeologist; she spec- tacularly busts up with him on site. In \"Uncles\" - the most knowing - she is an orphan turned outrageous TV person- ality who is ultimately hoist with her own petard. In \"Wil- derness Tips\" - the most sor- did - she is a Cinderella, now married to the local Prince Charming. The fellow sleeps with both of her sisters. In \"Death by Landscape\" - the most memorable - she is an elderly widow whose best friend suddenly disappeared for ever when they were girls. They had landed from their canoe on an island. One moment Lucy was there; the next - like Mary Rose - she was gone. In spite of marriage and two sons, Lois has still not got over it. The long hot Canadian sum- mers breed as many traumas as they do mosquito-bites in these emotionally damaged Atwood heroines. The lives they lead are brilliantly depicted; but the stories as a whole contain such a high pro- portion of loswrs and no-hopers that we end- by wondering whether the dice is not, after all, being deliberately loaded. The opportunities for women to succeed and to become con- tent in their chosen spheres are surely, even in Toronto, much greater than these sto- ries would suggest. It would, though, be a mistake to see them merely as contributions to the feminist argument. Each one is a work of art. Anthony Curtis",

   "text_content" : "Thubron's last two novels, A Cruel Mad- ness and Falling, were tightly circumscribed - a men- tal hospital in the one, a travel- ling circus in the other. It was as if their very claustrophobia, their obvious boundaries, had been invented to be an oppo- site pole to Thubron's travel writing - a chance to inhabit and to map out a territory in minutest detail rather than to visit and to describe a land, a society, that could not be entirely encompassed. But in Turning Back The Sun Thubron the traveller joins forces with Thubron the explorer of inner spaces; by creating a fictitious land, some plausible hybrid of Australia and southern Africa, he has retained total command of the topography, emotional as well as physical. It is a story in which the landscape and its inhabitants interpenetrate, in which the physical harshness of the surroundings conditions and controls all their behav- iour and the limits of their desires. Rayner is a doctor, con- demned by some unspecific totalitarianism to work in a remote outpost of his country, an enclave perched on the edge of a drought-stricken wilder- ness. The population of the town - white, cosmopolitan, exiled - lives out the colonial nightmare, threatened by the \"savages\" who wander the sur- rounding desert. In their isola- tion the inhabitants desper- ately try to re-create the social life of the capital, making taw- dry imitations of its sophistica- tion and entertainments, while blaming the aboriginals for the night raids which are under- mining their security and for TURNING BACK THE SUN by Colin Thubron Heinemann Â£13.99, 204 pages spreading the disease that marks them out like stigmata, disfiguring but not destroying. Surrounded by unthinking prejudice, it is a life that Ray- ner yearns to escape, to be accepted back in the capital in which he grew up. And when the chance comes, he tries to do just that, abandoning his affair with Zoe, a dancer in the local cabaret, and setting out to recapture the past. Predicta- bly, perhaps, that proves impossible; mentally and phys- ically (for he discovers on him- self the first signs of the dis- ease) he has been indelibly imprinted with the flimsy town. As the drought begins to break Rayner goes back to the hinterland and its mysterious resonances of the savages, and to be reconciled with Zoe. As always Thubron's prose has the power to fix a compel- ling image in a few words. The descriptions of Zod, trans- formed totally on stage by the mask of make-up and the dancer's movements, recall the haunting portrait of Clara the doomed trapeze artist in Fall- ing, defined entirely by her lightness and grace, while the desert with its forests of gum trees and cockatoos is painted with numinous intensity. But Turning Back The Sun lacks the cogency and limpid direct- ness of its predecessors. The themes, the public and the private, jostle uneasily; the layers of metaphor - Rayner as society's conscience and saviour, the disease as imperial disintegration - obscure the central thesis. \"You can't go home again\" is a commonplace enough starting point for a novel, and Rayner's own dilemma is never pinpointed with the subtlety and clarity that it truly deserves.

   "text_content" : "M AD ARISTOCRAT, greying civil ser- vant; North Oxford, school sports day, the status quo: both Ferdinand Mount and Michael Frayn have staked out this comfortable area of English satire as their territory. Yet both manage to distil out of it precisely individual visions and people - Frayn's idealls- tic/confused, Mount's ruthless/ vulnerable - whose divided sensibilities are kept afloat with the verve and assurance of old hands. Two novels, then, where everyday wit hints at irony, the surprise of fate, the intractability of character. Of Love and Asthma opens on a school playing field with a godfather collapsed in the par- ents' race (\"'Are you alright' said the headmaster, 'Splendid, only we lost a father last year'\"), and rushes on to a sim- ple but picaresque plot: the lifetime rivalry between two asthmatics, entrepreneur Joseph Dudgeon Followes and alsowran narrator Gus. Seduc- tlon, sedition, a rake's progress from aunt to ingenue cousin, from millionaire via bankrupt to (staged?) kidnap victim, it's a ranucous milange held comi- cally together by the vengeful gloom of illness.

   "text_content" : "refurbishment, Edinburgh's Lyceum Theatre has reopened - a month too late for the Festival, but just in time to commence an entire season of widely ranging repertory. The most visible change is the large glass box added to the theatre's facade, handsomely quadrupling foyer space. Other improvements have transformed stage machinery and backstage areas. I am happy to say that the intimate, well-shaped auditorium remains unchanged. The only feature of the opening show that I can unreservedly recommend is the play itself, An Ideal Husband but that is so good that it more than carries the evening. The Importance of Being Earnest is generally hailed as Oscar Wilde's best play - it is the one work loved by those who won't bother with anything else by Wilde (except maybe his life story) - but An Ideal Husband, while certainly very funny, has more scope, more breadth of spirit. It is in several ways the more remarkable feat. Its subjectmatter includes serious political blackmail and scandal, and the importance of a marriage's capacity to accommodate personal sins and imperfections. It coruscates with Wilde's wit, but is also profoundly suffused with his morality. George Bernard Shaw (who did not greatly care for The Importance, finding it often ig Gilbertlan and dismayingly full of ir stock farce devices) found An Ideal ie Husband modern, original and 't delightful. le The play's most striking aspect is the way it zigzags between talk le small and large. You can still hear it re said that Wilde's humour here does in not arise out of the play but is le superimposed. Not so. The fact that some of the characters rattle is away about nothing is discussed by d other characters; and he most 'a virtuoso rattle, Lord Goring, proves al to be the best philosopher of es them all. no For Wilde, amusing small talk is is the very stuff of high society. It is .w when people can no longer keep up e humour, after all, that the social ,n fabric is torn: a fabric which here is, arvelously subtle. Perhaps Wilde's most daring stroke (Uike'Jane Austen n Mansfield Park) is that -i main heroine, Lady Chiltern, 'has little wit, and his anti-heroine, 'Mrs Cheveley, has much. Many things about the Lyceum staging are obviously wrong; Gregory Smith's designs might do well in another context, but not here. The sets are decorated 'in high-decadent fin de s*cle style. A vast female nude stretches along the walls of the Chilterns' house (which is in Grosvenor Square): in whichn context it seems feeble;of Sir -obert to offer to show Mrs Chevelel his Corots.

Lord Goring (a Lord Peter Wimsey type) is played by Christopher Gee as a somewhat hysterical parody of Wilde himself: very greenery-yallery and much given to pouting and mugging. His way of underlining his remarks was so emphatic that his heels often left twice during a senteniee. As Lady rniltern, who should be fct, obae -ad as fli; as a SavlaW heroine, Rosaleen pan is 'wea li anddul David Gwillim is luff and plain s her husband; it ls ludicrous t'^conceive him as a, 'rislng .Pdoitician* I can, nonetheless, ai~m lne { tetÂ· i and- some of their SIl~eaguewcceed inn other roles. 'eaWereworse. Mrs . Still, the play delighted all of us present. Hugh Hodgart so directs things that the play's trickiest moment for modem audiences - the outdated view of .'male and female capacities taught by Lord Goring to Lady Chiltern - comes off as drollery. And Ruth Gemmell played Lady Mabel Chiltern with bewitching grace. She knows how to delight in other people's lines more than her own; and yet she has the secret of finding herself amusing. She has all the role's decorum, sense and impishness; and she alone finds the music in Wilde's lines. She speaks too quietly, but does so with such assurance that she draws the audience into her spell. A beautiful impersonation.",

   "text_content" : "N THIS new staging at the Nottingham Playhouse of Feydeau's 1907 farce, A Flea in her Ear, the big shock arrives at once, with Simon Vincenzi's designs. He and Pip Broughton, the director, have kept the play French but have updated it to the 1950s. Women hobble around hilariously in tight calf-length skirts and high heels and wear hats that are little more than one-line doodles in mid-air. The shock, however, lies not in this but in the colour scheme. Pastels jos- tle with Day-Glo hues. Dr Fin- ache wears an aquamarine suit, a pink shirt, and gloves, bow-tie and pocket handker- chief of matching pale prim- rose. An African fertility statue stands, doubly erect, on a green triangular shelf. Everything looks like the work of some witty modernist uncle of Christian Lacroix. In Feydeau, this works, wonder- fully. We know we are watch- ing a world where artifice is natural; where intrigue seems more apposite than modera- tion. Raymonde Chandebise fancies that her husband must be interested in some other woman; and out of this fancy (plus a few crazy circum- stances) erupts the whole three-act delirium. Everything is quite absurd, and wickedly close to home. Broughton makes it tick and hum like a magic clock. The best feature of all is the skill with which Broughton has welded her cast into a true ensemble. (The same team of Peter O'Brien. Barbara Thorn, Kate Fitzgeraid, Simon Roberts and Godfrey Jackman (foreground) In 'A Flea in her Ear actors will appear later this autumn in her Macbeth and he, Cherry Orchard.) Everyone here has the same rare under- standing of caricature, and of comic-opera timing. The over- all rhythm is generally so good that it shows you, I think, that it could be even tighter in the chaos of Act Two. There is just the right degree of serious bourgeois chic to distinguish Feydeau from suburban British sex comedy. John Mortimer's translation catches the Fey- s deau spirit with great skill, Sand with some great lines. e (\"Do you think I'll be made a fool of in front of myself?\" f \"Men are all the same - ready for anything except responsi- bility.\") t The tone is set by Kate Sitz- e gerald as Raymonde and Bar- t bara Thorn as Lucienne. The s only thing that stops Fitzger- i aid from being the ideal minx i is that she is not adorable. Her s suspiciousness, her scheming, r- her agitation, are all perfect, and very funny; and her voice is the epitome of petty bour- geois sophistication; but I still wanted to slap her the wrong way. There is not a weak link in the cast (though as Lucienne's infernally jealous husband Carlos, Jim Findley has the weakest conception of character). Simon Roberts does marvels as a cuckolded butler; the speed with which he flings himself to the floor to look under the sofa for his wife's paramour is breathtaking. Best of all is Jasper Britton as Chandebise's nephew Camille. We have all heard comic speech impediments before, but never have I found speech-impeded comedy of this calibre. You absolutely see why most of the other characters cannot understand a word he says; and yet you fully feel his exasperation and impatience. Camille becomes not only the funniest person on stage but also the most loveable.",

Fassbaender, Johnson. Hyperion CDJ 33011 POTENTIAL collectors should be warned that new recordings of Moz- art operas will be falling like leaves from the trees this autumn. The record companies have been working Mozart hard all year, but their policy is to hoard the prestigious and more expensive opera sets until now, so that they can catch the consumer's wallet at its most vulnerable in the fes- tive season. Among the conductors who is just completing a series of the three Da Ponte operas is Riccardo Muti. In essence these are Italian comic operas and the Italian Muti brings to them the bright sunshine and vivac- ity of spirit that one might rather associate with Rossini. His Don Giovanni is stream- lined in sound and often breathless in pace. Giovanni, he tells us, lives life in the fast lane and the opera catches him in his last hours as he hurtles towards its end. Muti himself has made much of the Italian quality that he wants to bring to his Mozart in the opera-house. Words are the important element here. The singers have been taught to speak the recitatives with extra clarity and meaning, although that also seems to have involved a lot of rolling of single \"r\"s, which I was taught is an improper feature in sung Italian. With this in mind, it is ironic that none of the leading parts is actually taken by an Italian performer. English-speaking artists predominate and often the same ones as on other new recordings of the opera, as there are simply not enough singers to go round. A compli- cated shuffling of roles means that this set has ended up with two renowned Don Giovannis and Donna Annas in the cast, which is a somewhat uncom- sortable luxury. The title-role is assumed by the young and personable Wil- liam Shimell, while the most celebrated Giovanni of the day, Samuel namey, wim me more aristocratic voice, finds himself as the servant Leporello, for which he has neither the right put-upon attitude nor the sense of humour. The two sopranos are Cheryl Studer and Carol Vaness, both formidable ladies with strong American voices and bags of spirit. Studer gets Anna here, while Vaness plays Elvira. Between them they threaten to dominate the opera to the point where it almost deserves a subtitle, \"The Tale of Two Women Scorned\". The supporting cast is ade- quate. Frank Lopardo's Don Ottavio lacks interest and the mezzo Zerlina of Susanne Mentzer does not touch the heart as she should; but Jan- Hendrik Rootering makes a sonorous cominatore. The recording Is eem t showing the sWil with which the Vienna Phuhamnic Orches tra plays for this coaductor. The fMal sseae, when Gio- vn is daed down to hell, is amog the ot exciting that I hae bE. M is, after Mll, aa Bna and be s opera Int Hbb d After so much Mozart, there is an urge to get as far away as possible. The Victorian English symphony seemed a suitably long way off and something of a backwater, too. Chandos has embarked on a series of Parry's symphonies (several of them not heard on record before) and produced fine perfor- mances and recordings. There is something quite bizarre about a composer going off to Bayreuth to attend the first performances of Parsifal and then coming back, enthralled, to write sympho- nies. But that is what Parry did and the works that he pro- duced are easily good enough to be revived now. The Second Symphony offers romance una- pologetically and the Third an appealing lightness of touch. Only the Fourth strikes me as disappointing, as Parry was too aware of Brahms peering over his shoulder while he was writ- ing it. Otherwise anybody who enjoys Elgar should make a note to investigate. Meanwhile Hyperion is prog- ressing nicely with two of its ambitious series. The fourth volume of the complete Purcell Odes has reached lesser known pieces, including one commis- sioned by a certain Mr Maid- well, a teacher, for his school Even at humdrum duties like this Purcell's invention happily never deserted him and the disc includes such delights as a duet for two growling basses and a beautiful-as-birdsong solo about a sparrow and a dove. Ye tuneful muses and From hardy climes complete the disc. The King's Consort offers rather laidback perfor- mances. The company's much-praised Schubert song series is further advanced andhas now reached Volume 1L This brings us Bri- gitte Fassbaender, the first German singer to tae part and so unabttomed a prfarmer that she sweeps aside any sugges- tion of excessively English decorum that may have ina- gered rom earlier volumes.

Special programmes or extra news will be on LW while regu- lar programmes continue on FM Listeners are already com- plaining, on the familiar ground that they like it as it is. One wouldn't review Hemlet without seeing it first, so I shall make no comment for a bit. The most pointed item in this last week before the \"new season\" fell on Radio 3 on Wednesday - The Gang that Fell Apart, a three-part asses- ment of the SDP by Anthony Howard, very apt to mark the Liberal conference and the pubiceation of Lord Jenklns's and Dr Owen's autobiogra- phaes. The first t went baek to the SDPs orlas, to a din- ner where Roy Jenkias dis- cussed the idea with David Stee. SMddey Williams was thought \"a critical figure\" but was not ready to take part; David Owen was \"scornful\". In 1981, Jenkins fought a by-elec- tion at Warrington and lost so narrowly that it was reckoned a victory. The first Social Dem- ocrat MP was Shirley Williams after her win at Crosby in November 1981; Jenkins was elected for Glasgow, Hillhead in March 1982. Anthony Howard's interest lies less in such events, however, than in the attitudes of the four (origi- nally three) members of the eponymous Gang. All four were heard in the programme, with sundry relevant figures from all parties. This first part ended at Falk- lands time; next week we shall observe the leadership compe- tition between Jenkins and Owen, and the electoral disap- pointments of 1963. In Face the Facts (Radio 4, Wednesday) John Waite inves- tigates matters liable to embar- rass serious people. Now and then this is so topical, or so much late research has to be done, that its subject is not given in the Radio ames, and indeed it wasn't this week. The concern was with Bridge House, a refuge for the home- less in Notting Hill, which the PSA closed down on the the ground that the drains were a danger to health and would cost Â£2 milton to repair. Resi- dents got a fortnight to leave; they had all been found new accommodation but were deeply unwilling to go. Local church and charity people asked to see the report on the drains and were refused, a refusal confirmed by Anne Widdicombe at the Minis- try. She also confirmed the Council's report that other things were wrong besides drains. But ageing and home- less folk, folk like Ernie Foley, who tearfully insisted that the place was \"home\", will always find sympathy, and it is good that such questions can be publicly presented from both sides. The case will be raised in the House at the next Parlia- mentary session. The Harpoon (Radio 4, Satur- day), is a parody of the young people's magazines of 50 years ago that few listeners will gen- uinely recall. What goes on in the Light Entertainment department?

   "text_content" : "N O ONE expects Ronnie Corbett to act; or to change in any way. In The Seven Year Itch he is what he has always been: a pair of spectacles; and a grin; and a wry chuckle; and a jocular performer of set routines; and a confiding monologue from an armchair. He even gets to wear a cardigan. In this staging by Lou Stein at the Palace Theatre, Watford, the play is set in London. Everyone else is carefully dressed by Terry Parsons in 1950s clothes and hairstyles; and the elaborate set is full of nice period details. But everything about little Ronnie looks and sounds just as it does on TV. His haircut, clothes, all look present-day. Everyone else is in a carefully-rehearsed Seven Year Itch; but he's doing The Ronnie Corbett Show. Most people think of The Seven Year Itch as a movie; and in particular as one sequence. Marilyn Monroe stands on a New York subway grating, and the gust from a passing train sending her skirt billowing up past her waist. (No view of Marilyn was ever more classic: she just stands there joyously. Her hands hold the skirt down, but the air shoots it up all around her, and doesn't that say everything about her? It's an iconic image.) But the 1955 movie was adapted by Billy Wilder and George Axelrod from the latter's play, which had been a Broadway hit. Onstage there is no subway grating, and no gust. Everything occurs in Ronnie Corbett's (I mean Martin Sherman's) apartment. Without Marilyn, The Seven Year Itch is a weary old farce about the fantasies of a middle-class middle-aged married man. You might think Corbett would fit right into this; but no. He is always ingratiating, never neurotic. He has no gift for panic. Whenever Sherman's fantasies dissolve into nightmares, all Corbett can do is what he always does - grin; chuckle; keep restarting his sentences; adjust his specs. The Girl Upstairs is still American in this version; she's only come to London recently. Gwen Humble, who really is American, is rather like a young Diana Dors - busty, blonde, ambitious. That might be interesting, but most of the time she pretended that she was just dizzy and artless. She seemed soon to sense what this muddled little man had in his head, and I never once believed that she would spend time with him after that. But, then, I couldn't begin to believe in this performance anyway. I found myself hating Sherman's silly adulterous fantasies; and when they briefly turned from fantasy to fact I found them sordid. That isn't the fault of the play. It's the fault of casting Corbett, who acts as if adultery should be handled by adjusting your specs; and restarting your sentences; and a chuckle; and a grin.",

   "text_content" : "THE FIELD Day Company's annual touring production which opened at the Guildhall, Dearv consists of a travellinf company presenting a play about a travelling company. The Madame Macadam Travelling Theatre troupe is bringing a medley of Shakespeare and melodrama to provincial Ireland during the second world war. Stranded in the back of beyond by the petrol shortage, the Thespians are caught up in a series of intrigues involving two teenaged schoolgirls, the Sergeant of the Guard, a greyhound racing scam, a missing child and a bunch of thugs who make up the Local Defence Force. The cast of 12 is joined by a real, live greyhound, Lightning Lily, who predictably steals the scene in each brief appearance. It is billed as \"a new Irish comedy\", but it would be disingenuous to expect Field Day, Ireland's self appointed intellectual conscience, to present a simple nostalgic farce. Playwright Thomas Kilroy, (Talbot Bar, Double Cross), bravely attempts an analysis of the very nature of theatrical experience within this unlikely framework. The set, by Monica Frawley, features the travel worn Macadam van, whose side doors open to reveal Madame herself framed in its red satin interior, musing on the glories of her chosen profession. The play consists of seven scenes, each introduced in synopsis by the recorded voice of Stephen Rea over ragtime piano like an old fashioned radio serial. In Scene Two the van serves as see-through stage-on-stage as the backs of the actors perform to an invisible (but voluble) audience up-stage, the real audience witnesses the actors' off-stage crises in a three-tier effect. Alas, although the sub plots thicken satisfactorily, they are interwoven with debates about the art and artifice of acting which soon becomes repetitious and confutsed. In the final three scenes the arguments are more effectively dramatised, and extended to the non-theatrical world. \"Sincere insincerity\" Is the core of great acting, Madame explains to the schoolgirl Jo, recently seduced by those very qualities in the company's jauvenile lead. Acting is also about costume, as the Sergeant, deprived of his uniform, realises, and as the local corner boys demonstrate so clearly when transformed by their militia gear. This is a difficult play for actors to get to grips with, but the company rises gamely to the challenge. Helen Ryan's Madame resembles a downmarket Maggie Smith growing in stature from a pathetic poseur to a wise, sympathetic woman. Julian Curry, as her camp leading man, has an easier time of it. Amanda Hurwitz and Tom Radcliffe throw themselves wholeheartedly into their demanding roles as Macadam's juvenile leads. Tina Kelleher and Finnuala Murphy are both funny and moving as a pair of stage struck teenagers, while Kevin Flood earns several laughs as the ineffectual Sergeant As it stands the play will disappoint both those expecting the advertised comedy and those in search of something more thought prov ng. Yet there remains the ta feeling that a few cts and a radical tighteing up of the direction (by Jim Nolan of Waterford Red Kettle Theatre Company) would result In a compromise to satisfy both tastes.

   "text_content" : "great red sun of the Japan Festi- val rfses over London. Like a sumo wrestler, the Festival is nothing if not a gen- erous spread. It really is nation-wide - it even includes Japan's World Cup rugby match against Zimbabwe, which is to be played in Belfast next month. There will be calligraphy in Colerane, kites at Llantwit Major and mounted archery this weekend in Hyde Park. Oshima's erotic masterpiece Ai No Corida will play uncut in Cardiff. Three Japanese poets touring the country will perse- vere all the way up to the Highlands and Islands, where a concert series will pit Scottish pipers against traditional Japa- nese instruments. Over the next five months it will be rather hard to avoid the Festival, unless you live well away from areas of heavy Jap- anese investment. Devon and Cornwall, for example, are not well served with venues although there is always the media coverage. Radio 3's Japan season looks impressive, with talks, plays and documen- taries which will examine some cultural topics which do not fit so easily into a festival framework - literature, for example, and the place women occupy within Japanese soci- ety. FT critics will be giving their reactions throughout. The Japan Festival ranks as one of the most ambitious attempts ever to introduce (peaceably, that is) one culture to the cultural traditions of another. The British and Japa- nese governments have con- tributed quite significantly to the Festival, but its budget of about Â£20m comes overwhelm- ingly from the hundreds of business sponsors. But how easy is it to speed up the pro- cess of cultural osmosis? What, in the end, will result from the fantastic expenditure of time and effort which has gone into planning the Festival? The ideals of the Festival are clear enough. It is meant to make Japan and the Japanese seem less mysterious, to rub away at widely prevalent ste- reotypes and at the consider- able British indifference to things Japanese. \"Behind the dedicated sac- tory workers and salary-men lies an amazingly rich and energetic culture of which we have until now only caught occasional glimpses,\" writes Sir Peter Parker, chairman of the Festival Committee. Japan's economic influence in the UK has not been matched by a corresponding increase in understanding of Japanese culture. The reasons are obvious, although distance perhaps matters more than the language barrier. One night spent in Tokyo is enough to show it has the potential to be to young people in the 1990s what London was in the 1960s - except, that is, for the cost of getting there. Quite simply, he Festival is meant to edu- cate all of us, young and not- so-young, high-brow and low- brow. Whatever part idealism has played in the calculations of the Festival's many sponsors, they have also been drawn to join in the jamboree by more immediate and tangible rewards - corporate hospital- ity, shared prestige, and the like. Cultural auditing will be left to the historians. It may be that the Japan Fes- tival 1991 will indeed mark a significant moment in Anglo- Japanese understanding. The Barbican Art Gallery's exhibi- tion, Japan and Britain: An Aesthetic Dialogue 1850-1930, will recall the Great Exhibi- tions of the last century, when Japanese governments shipped over selected aspects of Japa- nese culture to delight the Brit- ish public. Things Japanese were perceived as novel and colourfully exotic, and they had a strong influence - not least in giving us the baneful legacy of The Mikado. And that kind of uncompli- cated borrowing has continued; look at the invasion of Japa- nese cherry-trees into the English gardenscape. However, one great complicating factor has been Japan's cultural inva- sion by America. For over a century, Japanese intellectuals have been chewing over what \"Japanese\" culture means, in the face of influence from out- side which grows ever stron- ger. (Japanese mothers com- monly deplore their children's refusal to eat traditional cook- ing.) Have the Festival selec- tors chosen well? Not all the pundits think / I /! / / A view of Japan: \"Looking at Mount Fuji\", a print by Hokual from the exhibition at the Royal Academy tr /T -~ ( hÂ· I t I r: I t 1 i I 'i 1. '` `Â·, they have, as I found on a recent - and, it should be said, my first - visit to Japan. Some were saying the selection was too heavily weighted towards traditional arts, and that there is still too much playing to Mikadoesque stereotypes. Some say there is too much bias towards Tokyo. In the performing arts, there is criticism of run-of-the-mill offerings and \"names\" which, in the best circles, are regarded as curling a little at the edges. Sponsors have been relatively reluctant to contribute to the contemporary visual arts pro- gramme, which is said to be correspondingly unambitious, with no more than a dozen or so contemporary artists' work being represented at the Tate Gallery in Liverpool (coming to the Whitechapel) and exhibi- tions in Durham, Belfast, and Newcastle. Architecture makes a poor showing. But these look like quibbles when they are set beside igno- rance of Japanese high culture in western culture. Name one famous living Japanese artist. One famous monument. One work of art, apart from Hoku- sai's Great Wave. Those are the kind of simple questions which, at one level, the Japan Festival should leave us well prepared to answer. As Festi- val director David Barrie emphasises, it is keenly appre- dated in Japan if anyone doing business there expresses curi- osity and a willingness to sam- ple the host culture. For anyone already well up on contemporary Japan, the test will be how well the Festi- val conveys the complexities of this island culture which, since it opened up to the outside world in the 1860s, has looked so fixedly towards the west. Not all the incongruities of Japanese cultural life are immediately obvious. For example, we take it for granted that places such as the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, exist and will stage superb, scholarly loan exhibitions. But Japan has yet to catch on to museum culture. Many a visitor to Tokyo has been astonished to find that the National Museum is such a dull and horribly displayed oubliette of a place. The BM's exhibition of Kamakura will allow us to appreciate these masterpieces by Unkei, Kaikei and Tankei, with their crystal eyes and straining muscles, far more easily than the Japanese can at home. The gods and goddesses of Japan's religions, past and present, are also evoked at the flagship exhibition, Visions of Japan at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This show, above all, is the one which has to work hardest. It is meant to convey the incessant, yet end- lessly fruitful, friction as east meets west and tradition con- fronts modernity. Even the briefest contact with Japan brings that home. For me, it was the sight of young priests, waiting for evening prayers in the dark hall of a Kyoto tem- ple. A thousand life-sized stat- ues of the goddess Kannon looked on as they practised imaginary golf-swings. VOJ, as it is known, also has to display the kind of high- tech, electronic bravura to knock the most blase young visitor out of his or her socks. It has been overseen - not without controversy - by Arata Isozaki, one of the world's most interesting archi- tects and a prominent figure in avant-garde circles. So the omens are good for VOJ ach- ieving the near-impossible. Still, the question remains, what happens at the end of it all, when the Kamakura and the kites have gone? There has to be an after-life, if the Festi- val's ideals are not to look something of a sham. The Japan Society, whose cente- nary the Festival, in its dim and distant origins, is celebrat- ing, is in essence a learned society. It has a library, but only a tiny staff, and nothing further that the keen student might expect; no videos, no language courses, no cinema. The Japanese government ought to take a good look at the work done by the German government's cultural export wing, the Goethe Institute, or the British Council. And then it needs to create something many times as splendid. For the moment, schoolchildren are going to be better served than their elders. The Festival has found a strong response from schools and, as Chris Everett, director general of the Daiwa Anglo-Japan Founda- tion points out, it is part of a continuing programme to cre- ate educational links between the two countries. All festivals have a way of folding their tents and stealing away. But it would be a pity if the only thing of permanence to result from all this is two gardens, in Holland Park and Belfast. But maybe on the last day the announcement will be made that a palace, or some sort of splendid Isozaki-de- signed shrine to Japanese cul- ture, will be ours. What better sign could there be that the Japanese are here to stay? n Festival Guide price Â£2.50; on sale widely or ring 071-413-3310; 24 hours.",

   "text_content" : "T HE JAPAN Festival, by far the largest cul- tural event ever held in the UK, had mod- est origins. Martin Campbell- White, managing director of Harold Holt, had successfully organised a German arts festi- val in the UK. He wanted to repeat the experience: it made a change from running a musi- cal agency and did business no harm. He homed in on Japan, a natural choice given the growth of Japanese invest- ment in the UK and the rich, varied and, to western eyes, strange cultural traditions of that country. He approached Sir Hugh Cortazu, a former British Ambassador in Tokyo, who gave full support - and suggested a date. Why not use the centenary of the Japan Society in 1991 as the basis for the celebrations? The project was launched. It would never have grown to its present size, with more than 200 events nationwide financed by Â£20m of mainly business sponsorship, 1Sm of it from Japan, without the energy and enthusiasm of Sir Peter Parker who was invited in 1987 to become chairman. He insisted on a national, rather than a Landon Jambo- ree and got the proect Irollng. At the same time Shoichi Snba, a former head of Tosh- iba, and Kazuo Chiba, a for- er Japesse Ambassaedor in the U, started to put weight behind the proect in Japan. By the summer of 1 a Festi- val costed at aroui Om was taking shape based around half a does meaor pelects.

Â¶ am sw ~ NUMNO d will probably be invested in educational projects aimed to improve mutual understand- ing between the two nations. From the start half a dozen key events were selected as essential and they have emerged as the flagships of the Festival. There is no one major artistic exhibition showing the celebrated arts of Japan - lac- quer work, screens, prints, etc which are already famous in the West: the approach is eclectic. For example, the Jap- anese were more intent to dis- play Mingel, folkerafts, which are not so well known in the West, than traditional art. By far the most expensive show is Visions of Japan at the Victoria & Albert Museum. This has been designed by Arata osaki, perhaps Japan's best known architect and the designer of the Olympic Sta- dium at Barcelona. He has taken a favourite Japanese idea, that life is a game, and recruited three more archi- tects to give their interpreta- tiosm of this theme in Japan past, present and future in three huge rooms. The exhibi- tion has cost around U4m to mount, much of the cost eare senting gifts n kini. The VA has speeded the creation of an extensive exhibition space to find a home for this, its largest show in deceides.

   "text_content" : "The big event THE costliest, most populist event in the Japan Festival is undoubtedly Visions of Japan at the Victoria & Albert Museum from September 17. It has cost the most to mount - around Â£4m, contributed by hundreds of Japanese companies, much of it through goods in kind. It celebrates the V&A's re-emergence as a venue for major exhibitions and involved the creation of a new display area out of unexploited storage space. It is also the most ambitious in its horizons - visions of Japan, past, present and future. The guiding supremo is the architect Arata Isozaki (who is responsible for the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona) who took the concept of the game, an important idea in Japanese culture, as his theme. The first room, the past, is quiet and subdued, its open spaces interrupted by a replica of a 17th tea house and a hearse which bridges the gap between the ancient burial cart and the modern auto. The second room confronts the visitor with the full garishness of down-town Tokyo - karaoke parlour, vending machines, video games, gesticulating traffic cops, computerised fortune telling machines, massaging chairs - all the paraphernalia of one of the most rumbustious cities in the world. The third room is a disconcerting vision of the future, a moving audio visual experience which will stun some, unsettle others. Admission is Â£5, and take the family. There are guides to instruct you in the many \"hands on\" toys and to ensure you do not monopolise the goodies. Antony Thorncroft Visual arts KAMAKURA: The Renaissance of Japanese Sculpture (1185-1333), at the British Museum from Sept 18 to Nov 24, will be something strange and, I suspect, quite wonderful. This is temple art, and yet it does not require any prior knowledge of the Buddhist pantheon to respond to these powerful sculptures. The deities can be serenely beautiful or exceedingly enraged. Kamakura period sculptors also made images full of humanity and even pathos. In many cases the sculptures are life-size or larger and exceptionally fragile because they were made out of thin wooden sections, gilded and lacquered. Japanese art and history effectively starts here; there is nothing much earlier to be seen in the Festival apart from some of the objects in Behind Golden Screens, at the Royal Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh (until October 20). This is not a show which will travel, unfortunately, since the exquisite refinement of these screens and lacquerware, armour and paintings, satisfies everyone's idea of classic Japanese art. Here are the chrysanthemums and gold leaf, the animated scenes from the never-ending Tale of Genji, Cain you get more epicene than the game of kumiko,. using a lacquer incene box from which the players would'mix different fragrances to illustrate a poem or story? The exhibition comes from the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum, one of the country's private collections. Nihonga; Traditional Japanese Painting 1900-1940, at the British Museum (December 18 to March 1), promises to be highly controversial. In the early part of this century, many Japanese artists went to Paris and become, after a fashion, Impressionists - if they managed not to develop TB. If they stayed at home, they trained in the revivalist tradition of Nihonga, which means \"Japanese painting\". The examples of Nihonga I saw in Tokyo were large and faintly repellent images of exquisite ladies in kimonis playing grand pianos or vaccinating each other. I am keenly looking forward to the second instalment. Hokusai, at the Royal Academy of Arts (November 15 to February 9) is the first large-scale exhibition for 40 years of this prodigiously talented and, in his sketches, often comic artist. The Barbican Art Gallery's Japan and Britain: An Aesthetic Dialogue (October 17 to January 12) will illustrate the old story of \"Japonisme\" in Victorian and Edwardian Britain, with the work of artists such as Whistler, Beardsley, and Mackintosh, as well as looking at the unfamiliar other side of the exchange. Patricia Morison Contemporary art A PROPER view of contemporary art from Japan appears conspicuous for its absence in this festival. In a way this is inevitable, perhaps desirable, for the question of how the contemporary painter or sculptor in Japan addresses himself to the currency of international modernism is so broad and unresolved as to be impossible of summary. In such a festival as this, that celebrates a great cultural tradition, the artist who wishes to be true to his own experience of the modern world and to his understanding of what modern art might be, without yet denying the culture by which his experience has been determined, must stand aside. It is better to take the Japanese artist as and when he comes, taking the work for what it is rather for what trend or influence it might represent. Happily the private, extra-festive sector offers just that opportunity with the work of Katsura Funakoshi on show at Annely Juda (23 Dering Street, London W1) from September 18 until October 12. His carved, painted wooden sculptures are clearly portraits, yet they have the ambiguous simplicity and detachment of true monuments, as from a Roman or Egyptian tomb. If it must be a group show, best keep it small. \"Your Bag of Tricks\" holds the work of eight artists steeped in the post-modernist culture of the Japanese city. It opens in the Liverpool ate on oteer ; 16 and tranf tQ Whitechel aery, Londonig on Dcember 13. William P, Visual drama , KABUKI AND bunraku, here is the chance to sample t*9 forms of Japanese popular theatre which date back to, the late 16th and 17th ' centuries. Bunraku-Is theatre with 4ft high puppets .which take 30 years to learn to manipulate to degree level. Three puppeteers work to operate each puppet. Dialogue is in Japanese, with printed commentary, and Japanese audiences are said to be moved to tears frequently by the pathos of it all. Kabuki is rather fun. It is a sort of pantomime, with fabulous costumes, female impersonators who play all the female roles, and spectacular stage-effects for battles, spooky graveyards, etc. It can also include scenes of dreadful torpor and sentimentality. However, British audiences are getting a boiled-down version of Grand Kabuki, performed by the Shochiku Theatre Company. In Japan, performances last around five hours which is a pretty alarming prospect for a first-timer. So sampling kabuki and bunraku here is the soft option, with performances which are only two hours long. Kabuki dialogue is also in Japanese, but of such an archaic nature that I am told native audiences do not understand it either. Here, simultaneous English commentary will be provided through headphones, which works well at the Tokyo theatre. Do I recommend Kabuki? Yes, if only as a once-off experience which brings to life the actor-portraits and scenes beloved of the Ukiyoe print-makers. Patricia Morison Music/Classical THE TRULY excellent Saito Kinen Orchestra playing Brahms symphonies under Seiji Ozawa to open the Festival at the Royal Festival Hall (September 16) may well confirm the thoroughness and technical standards of training in a country that boasts a phenomenal rate of musical consumption, but it is unlikely to reveal a great deal about its indigenous musical culture. Music in the Japan Festival seems to have been conceived with its sights fixed firmly on what can be packaged for easy consumption by mainstream British audiences, rather than on providing genuine insights into a whole range of musics that remains scarcely known in the West. Though both Saito Kinen and the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, which tours throughout the country during October with its director Kazuyoshi Akiyama, include token Japanese works, they are all by composers who work within the Western tradition. Even when they integrate classical Japanese instruments like the Sho with a symphony orchestra, as in Toshi Ichiyanagi's commission for the Tokyo SO tour, the result is usually an uneasy compromise, a cultural clash of meaningless consequence. Yet Toru Takemitsu is a composer of genuine international stature, and the \"Takemitsu Signature\", the Barbican's weekend celebration (October 10-13) under the larger Japan umbrella offers some attractive looking programmes, placing his music in the context of those Western composers who have influenced him most profoundly. Thone concerts, and Capricorn s Drave umie survu of lea familiar fiasurs in the Purcell Room (September 30) promise to be the most rewarding events; but where is the survey of folk music, the Kabuki and the Gagaku? Andrew Clements MusiclJazz, Pop GIVEN Japan's prodigious consumption of Western contemporary music, it is unusual to see the tide reversed, albeit briefly.

As part of the festival, Sakamoto's concerts (Birmingham Town Hall, October 11; Hammersmith Odeon, October 13) will feature material spanning his career - from his electronic interpretation of Japanese traditional music, through' a Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence to his album of last year, Beauty (Virgin). Jazz alto saxophonist Sadao Watanabe has never appeared in the UK but will be showing both sides of his playing on this visit. As part of the festival, he will lead a (predominantly Japanese) sextet through his jazz funk repertoire at the Royal Festival Hall (November 25). Officially outside the festival, but with connivance from the organisers, he will also play a week's residency at Ronnie Scott's club (November 18 - 23) where he promises to revert to his Parker-influenced bop roots. The visit coincides with the release of a new George Duke produced album, \"Sweet Deal\" (Elektra) - his 60th release! Garry Booth Cinema JAPANESE cinema is one of the most distinctive of all national film cultures - formally innovative and daring, and yet, as far as content is concerned, rooted to history and tradition. Two seasons of Japanese films, one at the National Film Theatre continuing for the rest of this month, the other CinemaScope's long, thin \"letterbox\" format seems particularly suited, in retrospect, to the Japanese visual genius which has a history of using the horizontal axis in its beautiful painted screens. The season has already been in progress since the beginning of this month, but there are still pleasures to be had. Besides the marvellous Kwaidan by Kobayashion show this weekend (Saturday at 3.30, Sunday at 8.10) - a ghost story to end ghost stories - other films of extraordinary visual assurance include Ito's The Conspirator (Wednesday 18), Watanabe's version of The Loyal 47 Ronin (Sunday 15), Yoshimura's Bamboo Doll at Echizen (Saturday 21) and Tasaka's A Blighted Love at the Lake (Thursday 26). Meanwhile, over at the Barbican, an even more ambitious season aims to present 50 films from 50 different directors dating during the half century 1931-1991. The celebration begins with a screening of Kurosawa's Rhapsody in August (Tuesday 17). The great names of Japanese cinema are all represented, as one would expect: Mizoguchi (The Story of the Last Chrysanthemum, September 21), Kinugasa (Gate of Hell, September 29), Ozu (Equinox Flower, September 29). But the season is just as much an opportunity to explore the work of directors rather less known in the West yet in the overall perspective, equally lofty and poetic. Directors who should especially be looked out for are Toyoda (September 22), Uchida (September 26), Tasaka (September 28), Naruse (September 29), Yoshimura (October 4), Kawashima (October 5) and Imamura (October 17). Mark Le Fanu Theatre \"IT'S ALL very fine, but is it dance or Is it theatre?\" So runs the Western debate over the great Japanese traditions of Noh and Kabuki. To the Japanese, the distinctions do not exist - \"gino,\" the word for theatre, in fact means \"artistic skill,\" and it covers an awe-inspiring range of sMils, from the lamboyant urban theatre of Kabuki to the puppetry of Bunraku and the masked dancedranmas of Noh. But no theatre is an island, and he Japan Festival progranme oaers a taster of a tradition Vih has held on to li values, white. nvolving itself Wa vigorous proces of give and tae with Goer traditons from vaeron otir corners of Oe wored. On e giving sies ie director Yukio Ninagawa, whose Macbeth and Medea made such an impact in the past on London, has had mixed siuccess with a brave piece of cross-cultural collaboration. Peter Barnes' adaptation of Kunio Shumizu's play, Tango at the End of Winter, is magnificently set by Setsu Asakura in a dilapidated cinema, and has an English cast, which is headed by Alan Rickman and Suzanne Bertish. A tight programme of work at London's Mermaid Theatre shows how the Japanese have taken Shakespeare to heart, with a Kabuki-style Hamlet; a Bunraku Tempest; a modern, musical King Lear; and a Falstaff, in which the fat knight is appropriated to the dynastic Kyogen tradition of comic theatre. The prolific Chijinkai Theatre Company appears in Orin - a classic of its repertory, created by director Koichi Kimura and the novelist/playwright Minakami, and starring the film actress Ineko Arima. For traditionalists, there is National Bunraku Company, which is taking puppetry to London, Belfast and Nottingham, and the Shochiku Kabuki Company, making its British premiere at the National's Lyttleton theatre in a series of grand kabuki spectacles. For those who like their points of reference a little more clearly plotted, the festival also boasts the kabuki version of Jesus Christ Superstar, which has been 18 years in the Shiki company repertory. Apparently, the production boasts a success second only to that of Cats. Claire Armitstead Dance THE DANCE elements in the Festival range from the grandest traditions of Japanese theatre to the most modern, unknown and unguessable aspects of contemporary dance. Dominating the festival offerings is the presence of the Umewaka Kennokai Noh Company at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London between September 19 and 22 and thereafter in Manchester, Stirling and Hexham. A dynastic troupe, whose performances can be traced back to the 15th century, the company was last seen in Britain in 1967. For anyone unaware of the beauties of Noh theatre, it needs but to be said that it is an art whose effects are prodigiously concentrated, refined, and unfailingly powerful. Devotees know it to be theatre as a potent essence of experience and tradition. The Butoh form of modern dance, developed in Japan during the 1960s, is offered by the Sankai Juku troupe, already well-known here, who will be seen at Sadler's Wells between October 22 and November 2. The white-painted, almost naked performers tread through their rituals, and invite their audience into a world of mystaftiousV'** comments about the human condition. Theyv resent the inscrutably titled The Eggs Stands out of Curiosity. Also at Sadler's Wells, from November 5-9, the choreographer Saburo Teshigawara presents his company Kareas in Dah-Dah-Sko-Dah-Oah, about which nothing else is known. Also from the further shores of dance-theatre comes Parade by the Pappa Tarahumara company, to be seen at Riverside Studios on October 25 and 28. Clement Crisp Sumo IN JAPAN, there are six sumo tournaments a year, each lasting IS days and involving hundreds of rliahi in seven divisions. What the Albert Hll offers, from Wednesday, October 9, l a sherteied but relked verion, ve days long and featuring only the top 40 in the sport There oe weoig omm ut inddOi depen oniwuen4oeetvueeft each tournament. Win more than you lose and you go up the next time around and vice versa. A yokozuna (grand champion) can never be demoted, only retire, while an ozeki (the next rung) only goes down after two consecutive losing tournaments. Everybody else rises and falls automatically. On each day, the stars fight last. The Albert Hall affair is described as the first official sumo tournament outside Japan, previous excursions, to Paris and New York, being merely exhibitions. However performances next month will not affect the domestic rankings. Barring injuries in the present tournament in Tokyo, the London favourites ought to be the two yokozuna, the crafty Asahifuji and the fire hydrant Hokutoumi, and the two ozeki, one of them the 530 Ib Hawaiian, Konishiki. However, something of a generational change in sweeping through the sport, epitomised by the retirement this year of the great yokozuna Chiyonofuji after a defeat by the teenage sensation Takanohada. With each wrestler fighting once a day, in a short tournament anything can happen; a play-off for the title is probably more likely than not. Sumo wrestlers are remarkable for the explosion of power, and an individual contest can be over in less than a second, with the loser thrown down or pushed out. But, for all their bulk, they are considerable athletes, capable of much agility. If your Japanese neighbour swoons and mutters utchari, you will have seen something remarkable - where the winner, falling backwards and out, throws his opponent, all 300 lbs plus, out over his shoulder. For that reason, immediate ringside seats are not without risk. There is a lot of salt throwing and foot stamping before the two get at it. This is ritualistic but wrestlers sometimes use what Jeeves called \"the psychology of the individual\" to gain a mental upper hand. This process ought not to last for more than four minutes. The referee indicates when it should end by a discreet movement of his fan. What happens next is anything but discreet. Jurek Martin Garden design THE Japan Festival has left a lasting memorial in at least one corner of London. In 1902, a Japanese garden, long since obliterated, was built in part of the grounds of the then Lord Holland's park. This summer, a new Japanese garden has just been finished on a sloping acre of the same Holland Park in W11. Despite the hot weather, gardeners from Japan and England have coped valiantly with the job of laying out a large waterfall, complete with heavy boulders and stepping stones, and an elegantly curving pond with a traditional beach of pebbles on one bank. It badly needs rain, but 210 tonnes of Scottish rock have fallen naturally into position and the pool below the cascade has assumed the classic \"cloud\" shape of Japanese tradition. The design is convincing, restful and a great improvement on the previous undergrowth on the slope. Most of the existing trees were fitted cleverly into the scheme, including an impressive Tulip Tree. The city of Kyoto and its Chamber of Commerce and Industry have contributed Â£500,000 to the outcome. It is now up to the Borough of Kensington to see that the turf survives and the scheme stays in shape, helped by a rolling grant from Associated Newspapers. Traditional stone lanterns and Japanese water works fit rather well into the peculiar jungle of Holland Park and the idea deserves a warm welcome. The one pity is the planting. The obvious theme was a range of Japanese plants, but it all ought to have been more exciting. Purple-leaved berberis, honeysuckle and Portuguese Laurel have crept in among the usual rhododendrons and conifers. The big trees of evergreen Magnolia may survive the dry autumn, but there is much more to Japan's flora and its great contribution to English gardening than this limited range of shrubs, despite some welcome abelias and lespedezas. In 1902, lilies are said to have blossomed in turf beside a chain of lakes about 600 yards long. The design of the 1990s successor is stylish but, as so often, the cheapest part of any budget, the plants themselves, have suffered from a lack of imagination. Robin Lane Fox"

   "text_content" : "HE REMBRANDT exhibition that has just opened in Berlin is likely to prove as important an exhibition as any we shall see this side of the millennium. But what is there more to say of Rembrandt? The attempt itself is all but an impertinence. But the last great Rembrandt exhibition in Amsterdam in 1969 proposed the need for a thorough reap- praisal and catalogue raisonne. Ever since the controversial Rembrandt Research Project has slowly, implacably whit- tled down the old accepted oeuvre with the very latest sci- entific and chemical processes. There is no doubt that in the past Rembrandt was an attri- bution too lightly given, but now reliance upon purely sci- entific criteria, unmoderated by judgment, may be over-com- pensation. With the Project now at the mid 1640s and Rem- brandt more or less in mid-ca- reer, the time is right to take stock, to examine the findings so far, and to establish undis- puted common ground before examination continues to the later work. The three participating museums, the Gemaldegalerie in Berlin, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the National Gallery in London have between them the principal holdings of Rembrandt's work. Each has committed six undis- puted paintings which together cover every aspect of the work and every period in the career. This soundest of cores has been augmented by loans from private and public collections to make a group in all of some 50 undisputed works. Then come a further 30 or so, with works securely attributed to pupils or associates hung for direct comparison with works newly assigned to them or still in question. This is an important but dangerous business. By colour and handling, it is hard to see how the Jan Lievens \"Feast of Esther\" could ever be confused with Rembrandt, or the Nicolas Maes \"Saint Thomas\", where the drawing is so much weaker. On the other hand, our National Gallery's own \"Anna and the blind Tobit\" has now been given to Gerrit Dou which, by the evidence along- side, seems hard to take. The mood and feeling, the richness of the handling, are all so dif- ferent, so warm and tender in the one, so cold and distant in the other, for all the similar- ities of subject and composi- tion. Such distinctions are as hard to lay a finger on, but no less real for that. And there is the lovely \"Young Woman\" at an open half-door, of the 1640s, from Chicago, now given to Samuel van Hoogstraten, which is yet so close in spirit to Rembrandt as to be surely still in question. The prints and drawings, 40 odd of each, are all unquestioned, so too the few drawings by his pupils. The difficulty is that of the greatest painters, Rembrandt is one of the most various and idiosyncratic. Born with Titian and Veronese not so long dead and into the century of Rubens, Poussin and Velas- quez, he seems to stand aside from the great historical sweep of the post-renaissance tradi- tion. A child of his age, trained within a national school as rich and consistently produc- tive as any, himself a teacher with his pupils in his working studio, he was yet never fully assimilated with his contempo- raries and left no obvious and lasting legacy of influence. If he now speaks to us so directly and with such poi- gnancy, might it not be that his was at heart something closer to our own sensibility. History painter, child of the baroque, he was nonetheless out of his time, first of the moderns and the romantics in his self-centredness and self-ex- amination in his experience of the world. Is it then fanciful to see in him, in the sequence of self-portraits that punctuate this exhibition, the first in a line that will take us through Goya and Delacroix to Courbet and Degas, Van Gogh and Pic- asso? Rembrandt was a difficult man, perverse and self-destruc- tive in his relations with his patrons, harder still perhaps on his women, who sat at the very centre of his art, his life. Yet he loved women, as the tender and humane under- standing in all his depictions of them, young and old, is the clearest evidence. It might be Saskia as \"Flora\" in her prime; or the brief, assured study of a girl lifting her skirts clear of the water; or \"Bathsheba at the Fountain\", which is one of the great paintings of the nude, at once idealised and intimate; the exquisite portrait of a young lady, Agatha Bas, from the Royal Collection; or the ageing Aeltje, wife of Cornelis Anslo in the magnificent dou- ble portrait from Berlin; or again Saskia drawn in her youth, hand to cheek beneath her broad straw hat, the merest sketch - these are, in every case, images that touch the heart. Dear Rembrandt, the most humane, the most iunue- diate, the most vulnerable of painters, who could make the j epic personal, and the mun- dane glorious. This magnificent exhibition, sponsored throughout by ! American Express, remains at \" the Altes Museum, in what n was so lately East Berlin, until : November 10 and then moves ' on to the Rijksmuseum, to open in early December. The paintings and prints alone V come to the National Gallery in March,. when the British Museum is to furnish a distinct exhibition of drawings from its own collections. Throughout there will be changes, with works committed here but not there. There is nothing for it but to see them all. Yale University Press this week publishes (in separate edi- tions in six languages) 'Rem- brandt: The Master and His Workshop' in two volumes to accompany the exhibition.

   "text_content" : "T HE FAMOUS Vene- tian lion reading a book is back, after long cleaning, on its stone column by the Doge's Palace. To many festivalgoers this is symbolic. It means that Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books will win the Leone d'Oro for best film, to be announced this weekend. But will it? In a dream I saw the Golden Lion chasing the Chinese film Raise The Red Lantern, directed by Zhang Yimou of Ju Dou. I dreamed that the lion caught it and tore into it, whereupon beast and victim both assumed an expression of awesome bliss just like that on the faces of the film's Venice audience. In this dazzling dynastic drama a young girl (Gong Li) elects to become \"Fourth Mis- tress\" to a tyrannical old lord in 1920s China. Trapped with her for two hours, alias several years, in the maze-like palace, we act out a drama of inter- concubine jealousy, false preg- nancies, punishment by hang- ing (the Third Mistress is caught with a lover) and terror at the closing walls of an ines- capable destiny. You could view the film - you could hardly not do - as an allegory about Communist China. The \"rules of the fam- ily\" invoked by the lord, which range from barbarous punish- ments to potty rituals like the lighting of red lanterns outside the favoured mistress's suite each night, begin by bewil- dering the newcomer. Then with brief success she exploits them, outmanoeuvring her rivals. Finally they defeat her and drive her mad. The film's chilling formalist beauty outshines anything in Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, close cousin as a study in pala- tial claustrophobia. Ex-cinema- tographer Zhang Yimou knowkvs when to beatify an expanse of smoky-blue roof with a blood- red lantern; when to use snow- fall like a cosmic shroud over human hope; when to move his camera back from an action rather than forward to enhance its power. Brilliantly, we never see the lord's face in close-up. He is a shadowy totem exalted by remoteness, just like the wielders of a totalitarian power. Nothing at Venice matches this historical-tragical study in scarlet. But the 1991 Mostra Del Cinema was still the best in years. Stumbling between cinemas, you could catch radi- ant oddities like Jerzy Skoli- mowski's Thirty Door Key, with its tale of sexual-political awakening in 1930s Poland (seen through an English- speaking farce plot starring lain Glen and Robert Step- hens); Jean-Luc Godard's Ger- many Year Zero which frog- marches actor Eddie Constantine, plus quotes from Hegel, Goethe and old movies, all over united Germany; Wer- ner Herzog's Scream Of Stone, in which the mystical Hun goes mountain-climbing in Patagonia (nutty plot, nailbit- ing visuals); Manoel De Oliv- eira's The Divine Comedy, a Portuguese lunatic asylum comedy with religious trim- mings; Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King, with Robin Wil- liams and Jeff Bridges as an odd couple going the sword- and-sorcery route in modem Chm No SO: Qe7. If KS 2 Qe2 or K 2 NeS, or Kxh5 2 Qg, or KhS 2 Qh4. New York; and Nikita Mikhal- kov's Urga, hymning the endangered primitivism of Mongolia in a tale about a Soviet truck driver adrift in the post-Genghis grasslands. All this and the retrospective too. How many of you spotted my deliberate mistake in the last Venice dispatch? I said it was a season devoted to Hays Code Hollywood. It is of course devoted to pre-Hays Code Hol- lywood (1929-33); or at least to pre-strict-enforcement H.C.H. A free platinum statuette of Jean Harlow to Mrs G. Mafek- ing of Bexhill, who spotted the inexactitude and threatened to write to my editor. The retrospective continued to unveil the past and shine a light on the present. The won- der of early Western sound cin- ema - we realised this as we watched these precise social comedies and dramas whisked into wit by the likes of Tracy, Grant and Hepburn - was its sense of identity. The danger of modem Western cinema is that identity is yielding tolidentikit. Movies like Raise The Red 'Lantern cling bravely to their native language and history. But Venice also spotlighted the rise of the multi-country co- production, with its tendency to compel all participants to speak scarcely recognisable English. Herzog's mountain epic, with its Italian-Canadian- French-American cast headed by Donald Sutherland and Vit- torio Mezzogiorno had audi- ences giggling at the off-kilter dialogue even while goggling at the daredevil scenes on Torre Cerro. Skolimowski's Anglo-Polish comedy was a riot of atrocious dubbing. And an English-spoken version of Italy's L'amore Necessario, a sort of updated Dangerous Liai sons set in a spa hotel, gave us Ben Kingsley confidently speaking his own lines while everyone else (foreign) man- gled the Queen's language like nobody's biz. The most high-profile offender as we approach Seder- alised Europe Year Zero was Istvan Szabo's keenly awaited Meeting Venus, produced by David Puttnam. This opens in Britain next week, so let us not belabour it. But after a lively start the tale of clashing cul- tures on a Paris opera produc- tion becomes ever more Babel- like. Glenn Close is the soprano, Niels Arestrup is the East German conductor who falls in love with her, and, the supporting cast swarms with French, Swedish, Portuguese, Hungarian players, all pitching into the mad sonic potlatch. (Also, on a opera-practice note, whatever is Miss Close doing running round in the pouring rain on the eve of Tannhauser? Any singer who solicited head- colds like this would have been slung off the international reg- ister years before.) Never mind. One folly does not make a fiasco. Venice's dis- tinction as a festival continues to be its Italian sense of his- tory. New films are not seen, as in Cannes, merely as prod- ucts off the conveyor belt of modern culture. They are seen sub specie aeternitatis, or at least sub specie saeculi. This year's Hollywood retrospective jostled with brilliant Italian documentaries like The 600 Days Of Salo, stitching rare archive footage into a portrait of Mussolini, politician, legend and founder of the Venice Film Festival. And even modern Italian films like Marco Risi's Wall Of Silence, deftly drama- tising the 1980 scandal of a missile-downed passenger DC9, honour Italian cinema's neo-re- alist tradition of fiction as transfigured history. It will be a tragedy if Venice, as threatened, is bumped from its September slot by restless Cannes and driven into calen- dar exile. I doubt that it would survive an early-year date. Frail funding allied to Febru- ary weather would kill off an event already favoured more by connoisseurs than clamor- ous journalists. Let us hope it's still here this time next year. My gondola is already booked. Nigel Andrews",

   "text_content" : "WILL there be a British bid for Nigel Short's ten-game world title semi-final against the leg- endary Anatoly Karpov, sched- uled for April? On October 1 the executive council of Fide, the International Chess Federa- tion, meets in Qatar to decide who will host the semi-finals. Britain's chess sponsors have been Lloyds and NatWest banks, stockbrokers, private bankers, investment houses and computer companies. The 1986 world title match in Lon- don was financed by the now defunct GLC, the 1989 semi-fi- nals by Pilkington Glass. Some of these have suffered from the recession, and with two weeks to go the British Chess Federa- tion has no firm offer yet for Short v Karpov. Fide requires a Â£100,000 prize fund, of which the winner receives Â£62,500. Fide itself takes Â£10,000. Then there is a match venue; hospitality for players, their aides, and the match arbiters; press facilities; audience commentaries; elec- tronic equipment for global transmission of the moves; and pre-match publicity and admin- istration. In total, say Â£200,000 to Â£250,000. Karpov was world champion for ten years, and has won every match he has played at this level except against Kaspa- rov; but he is 40 and faces a 26-year-old in peak form. Short may be marginally the under- dog, but he is the best Western- born hope to break Russian dominance since the eccentric American Bobby Fischer. In the absence of a UK bid, the match venue could be out- side Europe. There is interest in France, Iceland and Spain. The Netherlands may offer to stage the other semi-final between Dutchman Jan Tim- man and Artur Yusupov of the Soviet Union. But the favourites are the Philippines, host of the 1990 interzonal, site of the 1992 chess olympics and home coun- try of Fide's president, Floren- do Campomanes. Chess No 889 White mates in two moves, against any defence (by L Riczu, 1969). Solution Page XX Leonard Barden",

   "text_content" : "IN TODAY'S hand from rubber bridge the declarer saw the right line, but he went about it the wrong way. Here is A Little Learning: N * Q985 S7532 SA4 *AQ8 W E 472 43 YJ4 YAKQ96 *J9532 *Q1087 4 J 964 K 10 2 S * A K J 106 4 Y 10 8 * K6 *753 With North-South game in, East dealt and opened the bid- ding with one heart, South overcalled with one spade, and North's four spades closed the auction. West led the knave of hearts, East overtook with his queen, cashed the king, and continued with the ace. The declarer ruffed with 10 of spades, and summed up the position. There were nine tricks for the taking, but the club king was obvi- ously offside. Deciding cor- rectly on elimination and end- play, South at trick four crossed to the eight of spades, ruffed the seven of hearts, drew West's last trump, and cashed ace and king of dia- monds. With the red suits elim- inated, he led the club three, intending to finesse dummy's eight. This would have worked, but an unfeeling West played his nine, the queen lost to East's king, and the club return set up another trick for the defence - one down. Had North's clubs been AQ9, declarer's plan would have suc- ceeded, but he chose the wrong throw-in. Shall we replay the hand with better technique? After ruffing the third heart, we draw trumps with ace and king, and eliminate the dia- monds, as the original declarer did, by cashing king and ace. But now we employ a different throw-in - one that really end- plays East. We play the seven of hearts, and on it discard a club from hand. East takes, and has no good return. He is forced to give the declarer his vital 10th trick, either by lead- ing into the club tenace, or by conceding the ruff discard. E.P.C Cotter",

   "text_content" : "I IMAGINE that industrialists wish- ing to indulge in a spasm of envy or gloating scan the share prices in the Finandal TWHine There is an equiv- alent therapy for writers and one in which I indulge: this is the book best-seller list published weekly in, among others, the Sunday Times. In aggregate, it might be described as the literary equivalent of the All- Share. Then it sub-divides into hardback (industrial miscella- neous), paperback (chemicals, plas- tics), non-fiction (engineering) and fiction (banks, HP and leasing). The market the lists describe is not as perfect as the stock market. No absolute figures for sales are given, only an order of popularity. And it is not clear whether the lishat is drawn up on the basis of actual sales to readers or merely of the volume take by distributors - who from time to time take large quanti- ties of books which subsequently flop, rather like obberscaught with too much stock. Only because of the farcical Net Book Agreement the distributors cannot cut the price to match supply with demand. I have been study the lists for some years, b ioo D fanctasiasg that a book by Dominic Lawson reaches the top of the paperbick \"cetion list and a there for a meaningfully enric length of time. But no fantasy can match the facts: that this weekend one book will have been in the best-seller liat for three years, or 150 weeks, in the jargon of the hit parade announcer. The book, A Br& f Huisof q/s Tim., is an attempt by the profoundly-dis- abled physcist, Stephen Hawking, to describe the way the universe works. It is startlingly simple, apparently, for a description of lie, the universe and everything. But I do not know anyone who has got to the end of the book. And yet, according to the DOay Telaraph, more than 500,000 copies have been sold in the UK. A few years ago in the US a mag- azine financed a trick on the pub- lishers of a similarly-obscure and fashionable book. The magazine ensured that every copy of the book in one big New York store had a card Inserted about a third of the way through the trendy book. On the card was a message to the effect that if the hidden slip was handed in, the bookseler (puid by the mae- azine) would hand over a prize of 10. No-one got that far. The point is that the desire to read a book is only one of the rea- sons why we buy it. The purchase must also reflect well on us. The less well a particular purchase reflects on us, the more genuine is our wish to buy the book in our hand. Conversely, to buy a book which tells the seller and your neighbours that you are the sort of man who wants to know, and is capable of knowing, how the world works - this is something so plea- surable that we would not feel cheated even if we discover that we cannot get past the preface. Perhaps the Financial Times is itself a beneficiary of this effect. In Paris, apparently, there are those who very much like to carry a copy of the FT under their arm, even if their grasp of English is negligible. The thing is, it looks different and is a symbol of intelligent affluence. The power of newspapers to transmit more information about the reader than they do to the reader is often under-estimated. The success of the Independent is undoubtedly based partly on the inoffensive apparent artiality of its title. Enihmen donot like making poltical statements about themselves in the Underground any more than they like physical con- tact with their fellow-passengers. So the Independent is ideal camouflage. Display The Guardian and you get funny looks from the City gent. Dis- play the Telegrph and those get- ting on at Isllngton glare at you. One of these days I plan to take the dust-jacket of A Bref History of Time into a crowded Tube train. Inside the jacket I shall place a book I actually want to read. I see this as publishing's answer to designer-clothing. * Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.",

   "text_content" : "B OOKS ARE special some- how: not only for what they contain but for what they say about their owners. The books you read reveal the sort of person you are. The ones you leave casually on the coffee table proclaim the person you would like to be. Do you have a library? Then you are a scholar and a gentleman. But if you buy your library by the yard, like Mr Biswas, then you are the worst kind of poseur. Books stand for education, which in Britain means they also stand for class and class mobility. (A quick test: Did you read Beatrix Potter as a child? Do your children?). That, I suspect, is why there is such a fuss about the dynamic MrTerry Maher. Maher (it is pronounced \"mar\") is a working class, Irish Catholic, Mancunian accountant who started in garden sheds, religious books and tableware and is now the larg- est book retailer in Britain after W.H. Smith. Pentos, the off-the-shelf conglom- erate he formed 20 years ago, owns Dillons, Hatchards, Economists' Bookshop, Claude Gill, Athena and Ryman, the stationer. Last week, after good interim results, Maher announced his latest attempt to kill 100 years of resale price mainte- nance in the British book trade - \"an organised conspiracy against the public interest\" - by cutting prices in a pre-Christmas promotion of new titles. Heckled at the last Booker Prize dinner, criticised for his aggressive business style, Maher has been seen as a threat to quality and choice. Like the wicked supermarket tycoon of the 1960s, he will drive the little shopkeeper out of busi- ness. He has even been accused of never reading a book in his life. Maher claims the opposition is fading. But it still has a champion in W.H. Smith, a chain not exactly renowned for its devotion to litera- ture. Smith's chairman is Sir Simon Hornby, who has a rather different background to Maher: Eton, the Guards, Oxford and Harvard Busi- ness School. Hornby says books are not baked beans. The phrase, implying that Maher is really a sort of grocer, encapsulates the spirit of this con- troversy. I asked Maher if he agreed. \"Well, yes, of course. But it doesn't take you very much further on to say that.\" It was ironic, he added, that Smith's should try to use the quality argument against Dillons. Why do you think they take this line? \"They are acting from self inter- est, like us. We are a threat to them. They're afraid of losing market share. I don't blame them for that. I do blame them for dressing it up in a different kind of clothing.\" Will your way of doing business result in bad books driving out good? \"It's the opposite, the very oppo- site. You could not have put it more badly.\" Maher laughed a mirthless laugh. \"If hard-back fiction has a future it will be because of the suc- cess of Dillons.\" Maher has the reputation of being tough and prickly. I found him very courteous, but his friendly manner seemed effortful. At the start of our encounter his right eye blinked rap- idly and he swallowed a lot. Maher said later he was shy, and I believe him. Also, he suspected (with some justification) that I had come to cast him in the role of unlettered work- ing-class boy versus the toffs, and he didn't like it very much. Was there a class issue behind the economic dispute about book pricing and marketing? \"The fact is that the book market in this country has been a narrow, elitist market and bookshops have been fairly forbidding places,\" Maher replied. \"People in the book trade are fairly inbred.\" N. Are you resented, perhaps, because you are an accountant and you think about bottom lines and efficiency and unglamorous things like distribution? \"Resented by who? Publishers are not opposed. I don't see any division between ourselves and publishers. The division is between ourselves and Smith's.\" You are an outsider in this business. \"When are you an insider? I've been in the book trade for 20 years.\" Don't you see yourself as a new broom? \"The book trade in the UK was, and to a large extent still is, frag- mented. Publishers were notori- ously inefficient and still are. I believed the professional marketing of books was a major business opportunity.\" It was a commercial opportunity which your training as an accoun- tant made obvious to you? \"I don't think of myself as an accountant. Certainly rm numerate but I don't recommend training as an accountant as a way to success in business. I don't think I'm a nat- ural accountant.\" What are you, naturally? \"Well, that's the difficult next question. rm more concerned with markets.\" He paused. \"It seems to me I have had a number of quite distinct phases in my life and if you had asked me at different times I would have given you a different answer.\" Maher seemed anxious to move on and deal with the unspoken charges against him of philistinism Paradoxically, he became much warmer, even relaxed. \"I wasn't brought up in a home where books were part of everyday life. Indeed, when I was reading books it was thought of as being a fairly unnatural kind of activity. And my reading has gradually developed. It's not exactly that I was late to books - how late ie late? - because I was reading books fairly widely in my early 20s.\" He added that he also wrote pollt ical pamphlets and a newspaper col- umn after joining the Liberal Party in outrage at Britain's war over Suez. Through politics (Maher stood twice for Parliament) he met his wife Barbara Grunbaum, daughter of a Jewish psychiatrist who fled from Berlin. She writes on cookery. I asked Maher what he reads now. The answer was Milan Kundera, Mario Vargas Io ! ranta short Chrtisdi Tyler asks Terry Maher, chairman of the Pentos chain, about class struggle in the book trade stories, MAthony Burgess (who went to the same grammar school in Manchester, Xaverian College), and anything by William Boyd. \"Last night I finished Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's wnich I found in my library, a 2s 6d Penguin. Of course there are enor mou gaps in my reading. But I am reasonably widely read.\" Somewhat ashamed by now, I asked him his taste in music. Both he and his wife grew up on modern lasz and he still goes to the Blue Note when he is in New York. But most of his listening today is classi- cal: he put Mozart's symphonies and piano concertos at the head of the list. He is a fiMend of one of the Amadeus Quartet and he frequents Glyndebourne. That's elite, I said. \"It's an enormous pleasure. A great day out. Why is it elitist to take advantage of what is available?\" Maher's working class roots, busi- ness dynamism and anti-Establish- ment attitudes would seem to make him a perfect Thatcherite product. Why was he not a Tory? \"Oh, God! I need just to go into a room full of Conservatives and I'm not a Tory. It's as simple as that. It isn't as simple as that, but that's the instinctive thing. \"I could have been persuaded if all Conservatives were like Chris Patten. But they're not. I'm an instinctive Liberal. Thatcher didn't have a monopoly on entrepre- neurism.\" What is about them that puts you o.? \"I don't feel comfortable with them.\" What makes you uncomfortable? Long pause. \"Arrogance, I guess, is the single word.\" The arrogance of natural superi- ority? \"Yes, I think so. The born-to-rule aspect of it. The arrogance on social issues.\" The poverty of his early life has not been a conscious motivation in Terry Maher's career. He was born n a back-to-back terrace house with an outside lavatory. His mother died when he was 11. He contracted tuberculosis and, formerly top of the class, missed a lot of chool. There was no question of univer- sity. His father, a printworker, drank all the money. \"It wasn't that unusual. He workte for the newpa- pers and you know how bad they are.\" Maher and his younger brother were brought up by a thrifty grandmother who had already raised her 12 children. \"It's odd, you see, I wasn't so aware of my own living conditions being that bad at the time. I didn't feel any sense of deprivation because I didn't know anything else.\" Maher said he did not set out to make money, but to succeed. (He has the same attitude towards ski-ing and tennis, both of which he took up late.) But you enjoy the money now you've got it? \"Very much so. But I don't have a dramatically lavish lifestyle. I have certain luxuries. I spend far, far too much on good wine, but not enor- mous mansions or yachts or any- thing like that.\" He forgot to men- tion the Bentley Continental convertible. You arrived late at the pleasures of life. \"Well, yes, but I wasn't aware that I wasn't enjoying the pleasure of life before.\" Maher laughed, with real amusement this time. Earlier I had asked whether he felt there was in general a lot of class prejudice about. He replied: \"No. Look, rm very much aware of class as being a fact of life in England. I don't believe for a second - I never even think in those terms - of being a victim of that English disease. Not at alL The very opposite. How could I possibly complain, given the opportunities that I have had? \"You see, the reality is more bor- ing for your column tan this terri- ble person of humble origin and Philistine views in the book trade.\" Not so, I thought later. No-one could call Maher boring."

   "text_content" : "Nigel Spivey LAST YEAR, for the first time, I came up to the City to attend an FT Christmas party, to meet the people who put this paper together and with whose by-lines I jostle from time to time. But I came away feel- ing disturbed. A golden blond, who turned out to be Lucia van der Post, peered at my lapel badge and exclaimed: \"Good heavens! From your writing, we always imagined you to be at least sixty-five.\" To demonstrate a precocious maturity, or fogeyish charm, is one thing. To create the impression that you are double your actual age is quite another. What particularly disturbs me, thinking about this, is that I never consciously adopted the manner of a weary old dog. I have never staked my style and morals in some stratum several genera- tions back. The truth is, I am out of joint with modem times. I ought to do something about it. I called my sister. She, bless her, is young, bright and streetwise. I told her I was tired of being taken for a pensioner in print, and that I had decided to get myself in tune with the late 20th cen- tury. I needed her advice. F HA1 Jotted notes on a --- pad by the tele- phone remind me UAMT of what, according I 1 to my sister, I had to do. (1) Get down; (2) Chill out; (3) Pump some iron; (4) Snort some coke; (5) Kick some ass; (6) Check out the movies. Options (1) and (2) remain obscure to me. Nos. (3) and (5) are variously repellent. I lack the spare cash for (4). But (6) I can contem- plate. I phoned my sis again. She would know what was worth watching. \"Before you start,\" I warned her, \"let me say this. Herr Arnold Schwarzenegger may be great in body, but he is ignoble and puny in soul. Those Mundane Turtles pass me by. And Madonna's conception seems to me utterly maculate.\" \"No worries,\" said my sister. \"It's a multi-screen cinema. Something for everyone. Even you. Howsabout Robin Hood? Got Kevin Costner in it,\" she added. \"He's a dude.\" And an American. That much I know. A Yankee in the court of Robin Hood? \"Go on,\" said my sister. \"It's wicked.\" Missing the laudatory meaning of the word in modern parlance, I thought: well, if we are going to get to grips with modem times, let us have the horror of it all full on the chin, with some crass American perversion of a time-honoured folk- tale. \"Fair enough. Robin Hood.\" I accompanied my sister to one of her favourite places, viz, the Metro Centre in Gateshead. Wanting to show that I had picked up the mod- ern habit of using opposites as syn- onyms, I loosened my collar inside the precincts of a mega-arcade, and declared: \"Hey. This is cool!\" Once inside the cinema, I settled down to the business of finding fault with our evening's entertain- ment. I was slightly disarmed by the commodious seating, and the large numbers of families out together evidently ready, with buck- ets of popcorn and bumpers of fizz, to enjoy their night at the cinema. What, I thought, has become of that monster, Chronivorous Video? But once the opening credits began to roll, I was happier. Here was the Bayeaux Tapestry: a massive anach- ronism for starters. Robin Hood, an American, was then plunged into the Crusades; and, most improba- bly, returned to somewhere which looked like Teesdale with a Moham- medan ally in tow. Of the two and a half hours of film, I compute that only half an hour was free of the 57 varieties of kicking ass and other violence. The Sheriff of Nottingham, and fellow villain Sir Guy Gisbome, owed most of their characterisation to that unspeakable programme Blackad- der: a scene of rape at the end of the film was performed with all the neo- brutalism of modern comedy. Throughout, a cavalier historicism which naturally provoked a pedan- tic disposition: wasn't it Roger Bacon who invented the telescope? Shouldn't the action be set in the reign of Edward II? And to which monastic order is Friar Tuck sup- posed to belong? My sister suffered these grouses with surprisingly good grace, though I suspect that when S she told her friends K _ about our night - out, the words nightmare or even )SAWS total nightmare fig- 0 0 ured largely. She said to me: \"Did you like anything about that film?\" I said I would have to think about that. I have thought about it, and these are the results. The violence quota is not, in fact, extraordinary. And the explicitness of the violence, while it certainly exceeds Errol Flynn, scores low when compared, say, with Homer. The cavalier chronology is more or less justifiable. None of the Medieval historians I consulted is able to locate Robin Hood convincingly in the reign of Edward I. Robin Hood is a myth, and it is in the character of a myth that successive generations adapt it to their own purposes and perspectives. On reflection, Robin's Mohammedan chum was an inspired piece of adaptation. We had some nice sentiments about the futility of the Crusades, and the need for global brotherhood. Yes, I know that it is easy to be ecumenical in that slick Benetton way. But it made me think - and check who indeed had invented the telescope. I found that while Roger Bacon gets the credit, you could point to some pioneering research in optics by one Ibn-al-Haitham (965-1020). A misty pre-Raphaelite version of Robin Hood this was not. But why should it be? There were echoes, for those that wanted to see them, of the Poll Tax revolts; and a peppering of what you could interpret as anti-Thatcherite ideology. Come 2091 there will have been more Robin Hoods: and that is just as it should be. \"So you see,\" I said to my sister, \"I am not quite the fossil that some people take me to be. And now I need your assistance for something else. Can you show me the way to something called an Acid House Party?\" N Michael Thompson-Noel is on leae.",
