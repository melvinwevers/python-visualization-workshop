   "text_content" : "I By Lionel Barber in Washington and Ralph Atkins in London PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH last night seized the opportu- nity created by the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union to announce the most sweeping changes in US defence strategy in 40 years. In a televised address to the nation, Mr Bush said the US would destroy all ground-based tactical nuclear weapons, bring home all nuclear cruise mis- siles from submarines and war- ships, and end a 24-year alert status for all US strategic bombers. Mr Bush called on the Soviet Union to match US actions and said he had received positive responses from President Mik- hail Gorbachev and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. \"We expect our bold initia- tives to be met with equally bold steps on the Soviet side. If it does not, then an historic opportunity will be lost.\" Mr Bush's mix of unilateral and negotiated cuts in the US nuclear arsenal comes amid growing pressure in the US Congress to cut the $300bn (Â£172bn) annual defence budget in response to the decline of the Soviet threat. Uncertainty about the fate of more than 30,000 nuclear war- heads in a fragmenting Soviet Union also appeared tq be behind last night's speech. \"The Soviet nuclear stockpile now seems less an instrument of national security, and more of a burden,\" Mr Bush said. .He gave his firmest pledge to date that the US would help the new Soviet leadership after the failure of the coup. Draw- ing parallels with east Europe's struggle to build dem- ocratic, market-based econo- mies, he said: \"They will need our help. And they will get it.\" The US proposals are designed to accelerate sharply the 25 to 30 per cent cut in long-range nuclear weapons agreed under the recently signed Start agreement. Although they will not result in immediate financial savings - and may even result in added costs due to termination of existing programmes - they do amount to an historic shift in US nuclear posture. Eventually, Mr Bush plans to negotiate a ban on all multi- warhead land-based strategic nuclear missiles, the most destabilising weapons cate- gory, to rely on single warhead missiles. As a first step, he said he was scrapping plans to mount up to 50 MX interconti- nental missiles on rail cars in the US and the single-warhead mobile Midgetman. He called on the Soviet Union to scrap its mobile multi-warhead long-range SS-24 missiles. Mr Bush also announced he was ordering the withdrawal of all tactical nuclear weapons from surface ships, attack sub- marines, as well as those attached to land-based nuclear aircraft. The proposal is signifi- cant since the US enjoys a marked advantage over the Soviet Union on naval nuclear arms and has long opposed arms control in this area. Mr Bush's proposals do not, however, cover strategic sea- Continued on Page 22 US nuclear arms cuts Continued f.om Pae 1 based nuclear systems such as the Trident submarine deter- rent. The US remained commit- ted to the nuclear triad of air-, sea-, and land-based nuclear deterrents, including the con- troversial B-2 bomber. An administration official who drew up the plans said the proposals \"do not address the capability of the French and British nuclear deterrents.\" US allies were notified in advance of the proposals. Mr John Major described the announcement as \"far-reach- tog\" and \"bold\". He hoped Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin would react with \"equal imagi- nation\", bringing about \"a turning point in our history\". Mr Major, who had spoken to Mr Bush, stressed that ade- quate conventional and nuclear forces would \"remain the bedrock of our security\". The prime minister revealed that for some time discussions bad been held with the US and other allies on ways of consoli- dating the historic changes that had occurred in etaern -urope and the Soviet Unimo. \"We all agreed that we should take further imagina- tive steps in arms control while preserving the essentials of our defence in a world which is still unstable,\" he said. As Mr Bush is pushing for step-by-step cuts in nuclear missiles, Britain's Trident sub- marine does not appear under immediate threat. The US proposals to elimi- nate short-range nuclear mis- siles and nuclear artillery in Europe have been flagged weB in advance, and are liely to be endored by the Nato over the nxt tio months.",

   "text_content" : "I By John Hunt, Environment Correspondent LONDON CITY Airport is to go ahead with a controversial plan to lengthen its runway for use by BAe 146 \"whisper Jets\". This will allow the airport to expand its services to cover the whole of Europe and may enable it to break even by 1994 or 1995. Approval for the plan, given yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, marks a big boost for the airport in London Dock- lands. The airport has made an Â£llm operating loss since it was opened in October 1987. The extension will cost Â£7m. Mr Heseltine and Mr Mal- colm Rifkind, transport secre- tary, also approved the con- struction of the Â£75.3m east London river brossing. This will be a box girder bridge - at 1,640 metres the longest in the UK - crossing the Thames at Gallions Reach, just east of London City Airport In a third decision, Mr Heseltine rejected a proposal for a City Heliport on the Thames, near Cannon Street Airport is finally cleared for take-off ........................... Page 4 station. He ruled that the noise and visual impact would be too great but recognised there was a demand for a heliport serving central London and has suggested a study of alterna- tive sites. The project, costing Â£15m, was proposed by City of Lon- don Heliport, a consortium formed by BAA, Hanson, Mid- land Bank, Trafalgar House, and the Carroll Group of prop- erty companies. The consor- tium intends to press for an alternative scheme. The airport extension and the bridge are opposed by envi- ronmentalists who fear greater airport noise. They also believe that more cars will be attracted to Docklands and east London. Mr Heseltine, in common with the inspector who con- ducted the public inquiry into a runway extension, believed the scheme would assist the regeneration of Docklands and bring benefits to the wider economy. The previous limitation on runway length meant the air- port could only be used by turbo-jets with an operating range of 250 miles. The exten- sion - from 1,030 metres to 1,199 metres - means that the BAe 146, which has a 1,000-mile range, will be able to serve such cities as Zurich, Berlin, Milan, Vienna, Oslo, Madrid and Rome. Work on the extension will start immediately and the run- way should be in operation by next April. The new runway is likely to mean an increase from 40 aircraft movements a day to 130. Mr William Charnock, man- aging director at London City Airport, said the airport, which is owned by the Mowlem Group, serves 200,000 passen- gers a year at the moment. It would break even with 500,000 to 600,000, a number he felt could be achieved by 1994 or 1995."

   "text_content" : "SBy Jullan Ozanne in Kinshasa THE IMPOVERISHED people of Kinshasa pillaged their city this week with an enthusiasm symbolised by the slogan on the front of the gutted General Motors showroom: Merci pour la fete, it reads - thank you for the party. Zairean policemen and sol- diers in stolen Ray-Ban sun- glasses watch idly from street corners, unable or unwilling to stop the relentless wrecking. Little remains of the com- mercial centre of Kinshasa. Only the big banks, a few offices and key installations remain unscathed, protected by the 1,600 French and Bel- gian soldiers who flew in ear- lier in the week. Thick coats of oil cover the road into the industrial areas of the capital. Skeletons of cars lie strewn by the roadside and across the railway tracks, stripped of wheels, seats, engines and instruments. Almost every factory has been smashed to pieces, their gates torn down. Papers and the wreckage of typewriters and photocopying machines lie strewn in courtyards. \"What they couldn't steal they tried to pick to pieces, what they couldn't pick to pieces, they vandalised and trashed,\" said Mr Robert Moore, the manager of a Brit- ish-owned factory producing sewing thread. Mr Moore, who lost every- thing except the clothes he was wearing in the looting on Mon- day night, was standing out- side his factory, which had been stripped of all its stock, machinery and fittings. At his house, plants lay thrown on the floors. Looters had even taken away the pots. A pile of rubble was all that remained of a modern bath- room, after the mob carried away his bath, toilet and basin. In the garden, some people had tried to take away a cloth- Continued on Page 22 Picture, Page 3 City laid to waste by looters contnued frompage es-line fixed on iron poles and cemented into the ground. \"I don't know any European who hasn't lost something or every- thing,\" said Mr Moore. \"People were still carrying things when French commandoes were fir- ing over their heads. They were like ants.\" Some have suffered more than loss of their property. Col A. De Smet, the commander of the Belgian paratroopers who along with their French coun- terparts intervened this week, confirmed that two European women, a Dane and an Italian, had been raped by mutinous soldiers in the first 24 hours of violence. French doctors in the capital estimate that, after four days of violent rioting, at least 100 people have died and more than 100 have been wounded. Europeans and other foreign- ers, assisted by the paratroop- ers, continued pouring out of Kinshasa yesterday. Several hundred, carrying small suit- cases, huddled behind iron gratings at the pier, waiting for the ferry to take them across the Zaire river to the neigh- bouring Congolese capital, Brazzaville. Mothers cradled babies in their arms and many people tried to take their cats and dogs with them. \"They took everything I have earned and worked for in the last 22 years,\" said a bitter Asian trader. Severe shortages of food and drugs and the destruction of shops and food-processing sac- tories threaten to plunge Kins- hasa, a city of 5m to 7m people, into famine and disease. At the huge South African- owned Metro cash-and-carry supermarket in downtown Kinshasa, looters yesterday trawled through open cans, rotting cardboard boxes, and burnt debris, looking for scraps of food to carry away. One boy scraped dirty peaches from the bottom of a rusty can while a woman scooped up flour from among the water-sodden ash. Three US C-130 Hercules transport aircraft were due to arrive yesterday evening in the first direct American air opera- tion to evacuate US nationals. Zaire's soldiers, who first started the wave of looting after the government refused to increase their monthly wage of 85,000 zaires (Â£2.44) are ref- using to go back to barracks. This is not surprising. Infla- tion is likely to reach 3,000 per cent by the end of this year. The economy is plagued by a critical shortage of foreign exchange from falling export revenues, gross public sector mismanagement, inefficiency and corruption. The last week will make matters worse. Gecamines. Zaire's state- owned copper and cobalt pro ducer, has had its key Kolwezi facility shut since Monday due I to rioting, it emerged yester- s day. Production was continu- ing in Lubumbashi and Kipu- V shi. The company called on Zairean and foreign troops to i guard installations. 9 President Mobutu Sese Seko, meanwhile, remains on his lux- ury Belgian river-boat 40km 3 up-river from the capital, e unresponsive to the crisis. In meetings with the ambas- sadors of France, Belgium and t Ivory Coast during the last 48 hours he is reported to have played down the looming D catastrophe, avoiding commit- ments either to reform the economy or install a demo- cratic government. There are growing fears that what little law and order i remains in the country will i break down immediately Bel- t glan and French troops depart. r There is no control over the r army,\" said one Belgian offi- cial. \"There could easily be civil war, or disintegration, as soon as we leave.\""

But the UN said the team would still spend last night under Iraqi restrictions. The accord, following an offer by Baghdad approved on Thurs- day by the UN Security Coun- cil, calls for the taking of an inventory of material assem- bled by the inspectors and pho- tocopied. The Iraqis would be permit- ted to be present for the inven- tory-taking but would not take part in the process. The announcement by Mr Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN secretary-general, said: \"Agreement has been reached between the inspectors and the Iraqi authorities on the modali- ties for an inventory of the doc- uments. It is expected that the inventory will be taken some- time tomorrow. Meanwhile, the inspectors are still in the com- pound, where they are spend- ing the night.\" Continued on Page 22 Man in the news, Page 6 Iraq agrees to free UN inspectors continued frompage 1 Mr Scott Ritter, an official with the UN commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said the Baghdad team would this morning start moving the seized documents to a hotel. Earlier, Mr Ahmed Hussein, the Iraqi foreign minister, repeated in a speech in the UN General Assembly Baghdad's contention that the UN was not authorised to obtain the disputed material. He said this comprised mainly personnel files and expressed fears that it would fall into unauthorised hands, including those of the Israeli intelligence service. The agreement left unre- solved whether the UN would be able to begin flying its own German-supplied helicopters on inspection missions tomor- row. UN officials said problems remained, including fuelling. Under a plan already agreed, an Iraqi pilot would be aboard each helicopter, but would not be able to take the controls. Bronwen Maddox writes: About 10 companies from vari- ous countries recently supplied Iraq with equipment and tech- nical advice for its nuclear weapons programme, Mr David Kay, head of the UN inspection team, said yesterday. Speaking from his earphone outside the national atomic energy headquarters in Bagh- dad, before the accord was reached, he said he and his col- leagues were ejected from the building as they began examin- ing financial records. Mr Kay said he had read only small parts of the files and photocopies, mainly in Arabic, that the team were holding in their bus and five cars, but that Iraq had cer- tainly received recent external advice \"across most of the pro- gramme\". He declined to iden- tify Iraq's suppliers and advis- ers for the time being. he said: \"You can only understand the scale of the Iraqi programme if you realise that normal financial con- straints just didn't apply.\" Iraqi sites to enrich uranium to weapon concentrations \"have Al quality fittings, and unbelievable parallel and mul- tiple facilities. They are brand new and way better than most US and western sites\". Iraq had made even more progress than he thought on design of nuclear weapons. Once steady production of enriched uranium had been achieved, weapons design would have been no obstacle.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey in Vienna ROMANIAN miners clashed with security forces on the streets of Bucharest last night, demanding the resignation of President Ion Iliescu, a price freeze and higher wages. The forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive off dem- onstrators attacking the presi- dential palace. The latest round of distur- bances came only hours after negotiations between miners' leaders and Mr Iliescu, whose political future appears to be in the hands of the miners. The crowd of 5,000, many of them local workers organised by trade unions, shouted \"assassins\" and chanted anti- communist slogans. They repeatedly regrouped to con- front the police. Earlier, Mr Miron Cosma, the miners' leader, emerged after talks with Mr Iliescu say- ing that the Romanian presi- dent had fulfilled all the min- ers' demands, including an end to austerity measures. Some of the protesters boarded trains to leave the cap- ital but several thousand remained, demanding Mr Iliescu's resignation. In an apparent attempt to regain the initiative, Mr Cosma last night re-called those who had already left, accusing Mr Iliescu of breaking the agree- ment and demanding to know why force was used. The unrest spread to the coal fields in Maramures, northern Romania, where yesterday more than 25,000 miners downed tools and shouted anti- government slogans. Earlier in the day, Mr Iliescu met leaders of the country's main political parties with the t lescu: on demanded intention of setting up a broad- based coalition government. He also met the ruling National Salvation Front, and raised the possibility of hold- ing a snap elections. In Bucharest last night, many of the miners were wielding pick axes, reminiscent of last year's events, when Mr Iliescu called the miners into the capital to quash anti- government demonstrations. Yesterday Mr Iliescu blamed Mr Petre Roman, the prime minister, for this week's vio- lence. The miners demanded his resignation on Wednesday after they had commandeered trains to Bucharest. Yesterday, Mr Roman again repeated that he would remain in office until law and order was restored. Mr Iliescu had said he would visit the Jiu valley coal mines in western Romania on Monday to talk to the miners, but sev- eral thousand miners were last night refusing to go home.",

   "text_content" : "Judy Dempsey explains the fall of the Bucharest government TTEMPTS by any new Romanian government to introduce radical economic and political reforms are likely to fail because the miners and other workers are too strong, and the country's democratic traditions too weak, according to Romanian liberals. They say no coalition gov- ernment will risk reforming the economy - crucial for attracting foreign investment - because the political climate will give no government the mandate to steer the country towards democracy and a mar- ket economy. The combination of these cir- cumstances led to the fall of Mr Petre Roman's government, following his attempts to intro- duce price reform, implement a radical privatisation package, and reduce subsidies for loss- making industries. The opposition to Mr Roman's reforms started in May 1990, when the National Salvation Front, which was catapulted into power follow- ing the violent overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989, won the elec- tions. Its election campaign, spear- headed by Mr Ion Iliescu, a for- mer ideology chief under Mr Ceausescu, promised workers that their living standards would be protected. Yesterday, miners reminded Mr liescu that he had broken that promise. That message contrasted sharply with the election programme of the opposition National Peasant party and Liberal party, both of which promised to introduce market reforms. Both opposition parties won less than 5 per cent of the vote, while the NSS secured a land- slide victory. Once in power, Mr Roman, along with a hand- ful of technocrats, tried to steer the country away from the highly centralised commu- nist-controlled economy. Each attempt at reform was blocked by the ruling NSS which, as a party, provided a safe-house for former commu- nists. Any reforms would have eroded the gargantuan bureau- cracy and the privileges held by former communists, as well as raising the prospect that the NSS would lose the elections which were scheduled for later this year. \"Mr Roman had tried to dis- tance himself from the populist policies of the NSF,\" a Roma- nian economist said yesterday. \"But the more he tried to intro- duce reforms, the more the NSS tried to sabotage them. Roman had no support.\" As head of the government, Mr Roman failed to woo over the intellectuals, many of whom belong to the Group of Social Dialogue, and the broad- based Civic Alliance. For instance, he failed to marginalise the extreme right- wing press, including the mass circulation weekly, Romania Mare, which frequently accused the government of sell- ing out the country to foreign- ers. This paper fuelled the pop- ulation's latent xenophobia, anti-semitism, and anti-intel- lectualism, thus depriving the government of any kind of sup- port from the media. is critics say he also failed to persuade sec- tions of the population that his government had made a complete break with the com- munist system. \"Even if Roman wanted really to dis- mantle the Securitate [former secret police], he could not do it because the NSS was domi- nated by former communists,\" commented a member of the National Peasant party. Romanian economists yester- day believed it would be diffi- cult to form a stable coalition government. The opposition parties have repeatedly ruled out a coalition with Mr Illescu as president. Besides, any new government will be loath to press ahead with reforms for fear it will be toppled by the miners. \"I do not know what the alternative is,\" a Romanian economist said. \"There are two solutions: fresh general elec- tions, which will give a new government legitimacy needed to bring this country into the 21st century; or, if the instabil- ity continues, a period of mar- tial law. I expect we have not heard the end of Mr Victor Stanculescu [the former defence minister, and outgoing minister of the economy],\" he added. \"\"~",

   "text_content" : "THE European Commu- nity may have to retrace some of its steps if there is to be any hope of agreement on political union at the Maastricht summit in 10 weeks' time, when heads of government meet to decide on a revised Treaty of Rome and on economic and monetary union. This follows an attack on Thursday by seven member states on proposals by the EC's current Dutch presidency, which wants to bring new poli- cies on external and internal security into the Community sphere and increase the Euro- pean parliament's powers. The Dutch now look as though they will have to incor- porate at least one of the main sections in the draft treaty tabled by Luxembourg, their predecessor in the presidency. On diplomat said yesterday: \"The compromise will have to be the marriage of the two texts, but there are no signs yet of a marriage contract.\" A senior UK official went further and said that \"a per- fectly plausible outcome, and a perfectly satisfactory one, would be to treat [the Dutch draft] as a compendium of use- ful ideas.\" Dissatisfaction with the Dutch draft treaty - outlined at The Hague on Tuesday - came into the open after Thursday's meeting of repre- sentatives of the 12 in Brussels. But although the UK, the most reluctant political unionist, found six allies against the plan,.the attacks came from several fronts. In broad terms, Germany and jelgium supported the Dutch text. The UK, Denmark and France were against it, and the rest were in the mid- die. Italy and Ireland were con- cerned that the proposals re- opened nearly settled debates close to the summit. No member state has changed its fundamental posi- tion in the negotiations, how- ever, so Monday's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels is likely to concentrate on agree- ing a mutually acceptable basis on which to negotiate. The Dutch presidency said yester- day it would try on Monday to go back to the substance of th- talks before tackliqg the \"theo- logical\" issues of structure. But EC diplomats on all sides said progress would almost certainly require revert- ing to the Luxembourg draft's \"three pillar\" structure. This kept plans for a new common and foreign security policy, and proposals to link internal security policies on issues from immigration to terrorism, sepa- rate from the EC jurisdiction covered by the Treaty of Rome. he Dutch have re-inte- grated all these ele- ments in their draft. Although there are sufficient exceptions to retain a domi- nant role for national govern- ments, the treaty as drafted would give the EC Commission and European parliament a voice in foreign and internal security policy. Even if this structural issue is resolved, however, big prob- lems remain. Germany will only agree to economic and monetary union (Emu) if the European parliament is strengthened, which opponents would see as a big push towards federalism. France has little time for the parliament it hosts in Stras- bourg, but in exchange for a deal on Emu is likely to go along with the proposal. The French objection to the structure proposed by the Dutch is not so much that it wants to keep EC institutions out of these areas, as that it sees a better chance of achiev- ing its aims with the struqture put forward by Luxembourg. Paris is also angry that the Dutch want to make EC secu- rity provisions \"complemen- tary\" to Nato's, overshadowing its hopes for a separate Euro- pean defence identity. While France and Germany can negotiate on the basis of what they want, the UK 12as defined its position by what it does not want. It therefore has little to trade except the threat to use the ultimate weapon of vetoing the treaty. The UK does not want a unitary treaty leading towards federalism, a leakage of parliamentary tov- ereignty to Strasbourg, any suggestion of majority voting in foreign policy or involve- ment in social policy aims.",

   "text_content" : "By Laura Silber in Belgrade THE Yugoslav federal army yesterday appeared to be with- drawing from strategic mili- tary bases on Croatia's Adri- atic coastline. Croatian radio yesterday said army units were pulling out of two barracks in Split, site of the naval headquarters. Bosnian radio also reported that the army was pulling out of barracks in Rueka, Croatia's largest port city. The army was also with- drawing from Sinj, 17 miles inland from Split, Croatian radio said. The units would be relocated to Knin, the centre of the Serb stronghold in south- west Croatia. Army units yes- terday were completing with- drawal from barracks in Vinkovci, a key railroad junc- tion near the Serbian border. The army has denied that is planning a total pull-out from Croatia. General Andrija Raseta, deputy commander of the fifth military district, which covers most of Croatia, told NIN, a Belgrade weekly: \"First we left Slovenia, now they want the same in Croatia. Next it will be Macedonia or Bosnia. What do they want, for us to end up on Corfu?\" The army has tried to sup- press reports of mass deser- tions by Serb reservists from the front and high casualties. But doctors at the army medi- cal centre in Belgrade, the Ser- bian and federal capital, said hundreds of wounded soldiers had been hospitalised over the past week alone. Croatia yesterday adopted a law which, in effect, bans mili- tary service for Croats in the federal army. The government of the southern republic of Macedonia yesterday called on reservists to boycott enforced mobilisation. The fragile ceasefire agreed between the federal army and the presidents of Serbia and Croatia on Sunday yesterday appearing to be holding despite sporadic gun battles in parts of central and eastern Croatia. Serb insurgents who were not included in the latest ceasefire have nothing to gain by respecting the agreement. Bel- grade radio said Croat forces yesterday attacked the army garrison in Vukovar, situated on the banks of the Danube river which marks the border with Serbia. Despite the lull in fighting, hopes for a lasting peace seem remote. Against this back- ground, peace campaigners yesterday paraded through Bel- grade. Their organisers said this might be the last chance to negotiate a political solution to avoid mass bloodshed. Peace in the balance, Page 7",

   "text_content" : "HE rocky Greek island set in Homer's wine-dark sea will look stunning in the brochure, but potential buyers should beware. If an Aegean island is uninhabited, it is usu- ally for a very good reason. The Greek government's plan to sell 35 small islands marks a startling departure from a tradition of jealously guarding the national patrimony. It was only after fierce pressure from the European Commission that a law banning foreigners from buying prop- erty on islands designated \"border regions\" was revised in 1988. Even now, considerable influence is needed if you want to buy a crumbling farmhouse on the south coast of Crete or put up a hotel on an eastern Aegean island. Acquiring a private Greek island was virtually impossible unless you were a Greek shipowner prepared to spend a considerable sum investing at home. But with this year's budget deficit likely to total at least Dr300bn (Â£862m) more than forecast, the government is desperately casting around for new ways to raise revenue. Announcement of the plan has caused an outcry in parliament, but a government spokes- man, while stressing that no final deci- sion has been taken, defended its right to sell state property. Surveys and valu- ation of the islands were going ahead. More than 3,700 Greek islands are scattered around the Ionian, Aegean and Cretan seas but only 200 are listed as inhabited. The real number may be smaller, as islands where a taverna opens in summer or a shepherd pas- tures his flock are also included. Mr Efthymios Christodoulou, the economy minister, says the islands in question, ranging from 50 to 200 acres, are being valued and will be put up for auction. There is no official word on prices, but an Athens estate agent with one or two private islands in his portfo- lio says the starting price \"for a small- ish piece of rock not too far from the coast,\" would be about $4m (Â£22m). Romance, rather than statistics, tends to colour discussion of the trade in islands. In London Knight Frank & Rutley, which believes it is the largest. international agent in this market, is non-committal about the effects of the property depression. \"There is not enough of a throughput to comment,\" says their Mr John Inge. \"Each one is different. It is not like a row of houses. But broadly speaking, very few elements of the property mar- ket have escaped the recession.\" But he argues that someone buying an island now would be making a good long-term investment. \"If money becomes more freely available, people become more exdcited. They are more likely to get carried away with the idea of owning a island.\" However, buyers should also take a hard look at the practicalities. The issues include whether boats can be landed, whether materials can be shipped across to build a house, whether the winds will blow it away in winter and whether there is an ade- quate water supply. Owners also have to consider the responsibilities associ- ated with the tenants, tourist attrac- tions and wildlife on the island. R elatively few foreigners buy property in Greece, partly becatse of legal and bureau- cratic complexities. Title deeds, espe- cially for island properties, can be hard to find and currency regulations are still restrictive in practice. The Gree* government has not yet produced a lst of the islands for sale, though they are reported to be places that have attracted inquiries in the past The Fliance Ministry admits that most lack electricity, a water source and facilities for a luxury yacht to dock. \"But that didn't deter Aristotle Onassis when he bouight Skorpios. People who want to buy islands are prepared to invest heavlf,\" says one official. A quick dek of island names that have been intoned hints at why the Greeks left tl one. Anydros means 'waterles\" id Atokos \"barren.\" The island of Fleves, close to the coast of Attica, was used as a military base dur- ing the colonels' dictatorship of the 1960s. Who is likely to buy a Greek island? In the government's view, German and Scandinavian investors. The price of all islands on the world market range from a few hundred thousand to several mil- lion dollars. The archetypal buyer is a rich individual with homes scattered all over the world who wants a hideaway for, at most, a couple of months of the year. However, information on the identity of island buyers is deliberately scarce. \"The nature of islands is that they are private things,\" says Mr Inge. \"There is no conflict about where boundaries end. They ate very emotive things.\" There is talk of turning some of the larger Oreek islands on offer into natur- ist have But if seekers after seclu- sion a* to be protected, the govern- ment will have to take additional, unpopdhr, measures. There are no pri- vate beches in Greece because access to the shoreline must be free. \"The biggest problem for island-own- ers is having yachts mooring in your bay am speedboats landing people on your It ruins your privacy and thee's botling you can do about it,\" says Athens estate agent.",

A meeting this week between leaders of Russia's commercial banks and Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian central bank, ended in acrimony. The bank presidents vowed to draft their own banking legislation for submission to the Russian gov- ernment, to counter what they claim is Mr Matiukhin's harsh >t and anti-market regime. it Mr Matiukhin is under con- Y- stant attack from the commer- Le cial banks to resign - a cam- s, paign which has support from .e the news media, and from min- * isters in the Russian govern- r- ment.

In his view, the transfer abroad of communist money recalls the Nazis' efforts to salt away cash at the end of the war. * being the nucleus of a threat to the new constitu- tional order. \"They have acquired economic power: now they are trying to control the political power - to determine who should be ministers, who should be the leading officials.\" * flagrantly disobeying rules laid down by the central bank. \"We set 25 per cent as the max- imum interest rate: they charge 50 or 60 per cent: even up to 1,000 per cent a year for short-term loans.\" At the union level, the republican bank chairmen are to meet next month to agree a structure for a Central Bank Council which would replace Gosbank as the guarantor of monetary stability. However, Gosbank executives believe no agreement is possible which will deliver such stability because the republican banks are under the control of their respective political leaderships, who demand continued grant- ing of credits, forcing Gosbank to print more money.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt MR Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday took an uncompro- mising stand on the need for a stable D-Mark and low infla- tion in.the interests of Ger- many and Europe as the EC moves towards a common monetary policy. He also raised a delicate political issue by saying other EC central banks should become fully independent of their governments before rather than after a European central bank is set up. He did not mention the UK, whose government has made no move to give the Bank of England greater independence. The Bundesbank's autonomy is guaranteed by law. Reasserting his firm line on domestic inflation, Mr Schles- inger said it was the German central bank's \"most urgent task\" to return the D-Mark to a path of stability. Thus he made clear the Bundesbank would not be deflected from its tight monetary policies. German inflation recently exceeded 4 per cent, prompting the Bundesbank to raise inter- est rates. In September, it slipped to an annual 3.9 per cent, but the Bundesbank is concerned about future wage deals and the value added tax rise planned for 1993. \"A reduction of the upward movement of prices in Ger- many to about 2 per cent per annum is essential, and not only for domestic reasons; we also wish to contribute to the establishment of a Europe 1 which is oriented towards sta- bility,\" Mr Schlesinger said.

   "text_content" : "By Lamis Andoni in Algiers and Hugh Camegy in Jerusalem MR Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisa- tion, yesterday praised Presi- dent George Bush in a further attempt to persuade his fellow Palestinians to accept a US- sponsored Middle East peace conference. At a session of the Palestine National Council - the PLO parliament-in-exile meeting in Algiers - Mr Arafat called Mr Bush \"courageous\" for making encouraging remarks about Palestinian political rights dur- ing a meeting in Washington with King Hassan of Morocco. Mr Arafat was attempting to undermine hardline arguments that the PLO will compromise Palestinian rights by authori- sing Palestinian participation in the peace process. The PLO hopes that by draw- ing closer to US terms for a peace conference it will per- suade Washington to resume the dialogue severed after an aborted seaborne raid on Israel by the radical Palestine Liberation Front in May 1990. In another signal aimed at meeting US conditions, Pales- tinian officials said Mr Mohammed Abbas, the PLF leader better known as Abul Abbas, will be removed from the PLO executive committee and replaced by another mem- ber of his group. Two senior Palestinian lead- ers from the Israeli-occupied territories meanwhile strongly denied that they had attended the PNC meeting. Israel said attendance could result in their prosecution for breaking anti-terrorist laws. The issue threatened to dis- rupt US preparations for a peace conference as the two - Mr Faisal Husseini and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi - have been the chief Palestinian negotia- tors with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state. The issue has taken on sig- nificance as a test of the Pales- tinian demand that they choose their representatives to a peace conference unfettered. * Mr Boris Pankin, the Soviet Foreign Minister, said yester- day his country would resume full diplomatic relations with Israel before the convening of a Middle East peace conference and hoped ties would be re-es- tablished in October.",

Vietnam has shied away from accepting forced returns since Hong Kong sent back 51 boat people against their will in 1989, leading to fierce inter- national criticism, especially from the US. However Britain now believes Vietnam is increas- ingly embarrassed by the num- bers of boat people camped in the rdgion and is frustrated at its slow progress re-establish- ing formal links with the US. The development follows four days of talks between Britain, Hong Kong and Viet- nam in Hanoi. In a carefully worded joint communique, the governments spoke of \"alterna- tive methods\" to speed up the return of boat people and said: \"There was agreement in prin- ciple on the need to implement measures to achieve an accel- erated rate of return.\" Although similar commit- ments have been made in the past, British and Hong Kong officials believe they are close to a breakthrough. Hong Kong has witnessed an unusually high rate of arrivals this month, with more than 1,100 boat people reaching the colony in the last week. Most have been classified as eco- nomic migrants, who do not qualify for repatriation to third countries, rather than genuine refugees. The European Community yesterday announced details of a package designed to convince boat people classified as eco- nomic migrants to return home and to stop further departures from Vietnam. The package, which will cost $15m (Â£8.6m) in the first six months, provides loans and vocational training to retur- nees and those in Vietnam.",

   "text_content" : "PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday blamed bank regula. tors for curbing the supply of credit and endangering the fragile economic recovery, writes Michael Prowse In Washington. Mr Bush's remarks were made, at a meeting of the cabinet-level economic policy council attended by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. The council met for the second time this week to discuss ways of reviv- ing economic growth. The White House is facing increasing political pressure on the economy. On Friday, reports of a sharp rise in the official poverty rate last year - the first since 1983 - received extensive coverage in the US media. The poverty rate is likely to rise further this year and could prove an elec- toral liability next year if eco- nomic growth does not acceler- ate. Revised figures this week showed a larger than expected decline in gross national prod- uct in the second quarter, undermining White House claims that recovery began in May. A string of weak eco- nomic statistics is expected next week. A White House spokesman said Mr Bush was particularly concerned that bank examiners should not exert a \"chilling effect\" on the availability of credit at a time when interest rates were falling. The White House focus on credit reflects its inability to stimulate the economy fiscally. The federal budget deficit is expected to exceed $350bn (Â£200bn) next year. * Judge Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee for the vacant seat on the US Supreme Court, yesterday failed to win endorsement from the Senate judiciary commit- tee, which was split 7-7 on his appointment, writes George Graham in Washington.

The Court is being set up to replace the Privy Council, the present final appeal court, ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 return to China. Senior Hong Kong lawyers said the agreement, which allows for a maximum of only one of the five appeal judges to come from overseas, raised questions about the quality and stature of the court. There are also concerns that China is trying to gain influence over all appointments. Mr Simon Ip, newly elected representative of the legal pro- session in the Legislative Coun- cil, said Hong Kong needed the option to appoint more over- seas judges, especially in the court's early stages, because too few judges in the colony were adequately qualified.

Industrial production in August posted a year-on-year rise of just 0.5 per cent. On a month-on-month basis output declined 2.1 per cent, consider- ably more sharply than the official forecast of a month-on- month 0.3 per cent fall. The Ministry of Interna- tional Trade and Industry (Miti) said that precision instruments and plastic prod- ucts were the only sectors in which production rose. Ship- ments for the month fell 1.1 per cent from July. An unexpectedly sharp 9.9 per cent year-on-year rise in inventories prompted a Miti official to comment that the ministry was watching the fig- ures \"with concern\". The inventory index rose 1 per cent from the previous month to 119, while the inventory- sales index ratio gained 2.3 per cent to 101.4. Consumer prices published by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) yesterday were also significantly lower than expected, rising 2.8 per cent year-on-year in September for the Tokyo metropolitan area, the first time in 12 months that the rise was below 3 per cent. The agency said that declines in fresh vegetable and fruit prices had caused the slowdown. The core rate of inflation, for prices excluding perishable products, rose 3.0 per cent from a year ago. The nationwide consumer price index rose 3.3 per cent year- on-year and 0.2 per cent from the previous month. The EPA announced at the beginning of the week that the economy had achieved the lon- gest spell of post-war growth, and that there was no reversal in sight. Mr Russell Jones at stockbrokers UBS Phillips & Drew said that yesterday's releases suggested that the real economy was not as robust as the authorities per- ceived.",

   "text_content" : "By Norma Cohen, Investments Correspondent COMPANIES WILL be required to tell shareholders how much they pay their accountants for non- auditing services such as manage- ment consultancy, under regulations announced yesterday. The rules - introduced by Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister - are aimed at offering shareholders an insight into the independence of auditors. The collapse of several companies that had been given a clean bill of health by auditors shortly before they ran into trouble has set alarm bells ringing with institutional shareholders, who wonder whether they can trust audit statements. The government hopes the new rules will complement the regula- tory system for auditors introduced in Part II of the Companies Act of 1989. Companies are already required to disclose how much they pay in audit fees. The disclosure of non-auditing fees has been sought by shareholder groups, including the National Asso- ciation of Pension Funds (NAPS); which last month asked the Accounting Standards Board td adopt a similar rule. Mr Angus Matheson, vice-chair; man of the NAPF's investment comr mittee and managing director of Bothwell Asset Management, said: \"This clarifies the relationship .between the accounting firm and the company. He explained that accountancy firms that become dependent upon the huge fees earned for consultancy services provided to auditing clients may not wish to jeopardise that rela- tionship by disclosing adverse infor- mation in company accounts. Shareholders who become con- cerned about the relationship could then insist that another auditing firm be selected. The NAPS, whose members include some of Britain's largest y institutional shareholders, is Urging n that companies disclose much y more information in their accounts ;s than is at present the i- practice. r- The Institute of Chartered Accoun- tants in England and Wales said it i- believed the new rules were upnec- d essary. Mr Giles Wintle, chairnan of g the Institute's company law colimit- tee, said: \"It is one more piece of s information that is not particularly it useful.\" He said that merely disclosing company payments to auditing firms would not give shareholders suffi- cient insight into how dependent the company's business was to the audi- tor's overall profits. The new rules apply to financial years beginning after October 1 1991. They will not apply to small or mid- sized companies, defined as those with annual turnover of less than Â£8m, a balance sheet of less than Â£3.9m and fewer than 250 employees."

The decision of Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, to allow the Dock- lands airport to extend its run- way by almost 20 per cent to 1,199 metres has lifted the fog surrounding the airport by making it accessible to jet air- craft. The Â£35m airport, opened in grand style by the Queen four years ago, has been struggling to make ends meet because of its runway restrictions. Mow- lem, the construction group headed by Sir Philip Beck that owns 90 per cent of the airport, was forced to make a Â£33m pro- vision against the loss-making airport in its 1989 accounts. Airlines were reluctant to com- mit themselves because of, doubts over the airport's future. But Mowlem and Mr William Charnock, the airport's manag- ing director, never lost hope. Yesterday they said they were relieved by Mr Heseltine's deci- sion, which would enable Lon- don City to become \"the first airport dedicated to European business travel from 1992\". The runway extension approval will also provide Brit- ish Aerospace with a badly needed boost for its BAe 146 regional aircraft. The four-en- gine BAe 146 jet was especially developed to operate on small runways. It is also a very quiet aircraft (a so-called \"whisper jet\") that can operate at air- ports with stringent noise restrictions. Apart from the BAe 146, the runway extension will enable a range of new, 500-mile-range turboptop aircraft, to operate from the airport. They will include the Fokker .50, the FrancoJtalian ATR42, the Saab. 340B and the Canadian de Hav- illand Dash 8. Until now, the airport's short runway has restricted operations to the 250-300-mile THE HEAD of London Buses and the Docklands light rail- way has decided to leave the posts next year for personal and health reasons, Richard Evans writes. A memorandum circulated yesterday to senior staff by Mr Wilfrid Newton, London Transport chairman, said Mr John Telford Beasley, LT dep- uty chief executive, intended to resign on March 21 next year. He is 62 and has a salary of Â£75,000. There were sugges- tions that the resignation of such a senior manager would fuel speculation that London Transport might soon be dis- solved as a corporate body, but LT insisted that there was nothing political about Mr Beasley's departure. It is understood that Mr Beasley's doctors advised him to resign immediatevy on health grounds, but he decided to stay on to complete various tasks related to his posts. There has been considerable criticism of the Docklands light railway in recent months over poor reliability and Mr Beasley wishes to stay to see improvements put into prac- tice. The DLR, opened in 1987 at a cost of Â£77m, is Canary Wharf's main transport link with the rest of London. Mr Beasley was appointed to LT in 1984 by Mr Nicholas Ridley. range de Havilland Dash 7, pro- duction of which has been halted, and the German Dor- nier 228. That meant the air- port could serve only a limited number of destinations close to London including Paris,.- Amsterdam and.Brussels.._._. The airport will now be able to extend its network in Europe to serve business desti- nations such as Zurich, Berlin, Milan, Vienna, Madrid, Oslo or Rome with BAe 146 jet ser- vices. Mr Charnock explained: \"Up until now we have been restricted to an effective oper- ating range within a 250-mile radius.\" . .London City Airport was cQceltwed.fnrla.the start as a business airport. Its proximity to the heart of the City of Lon- don (six miles away) has been one of its selling points. It also has an attractive, and roomy terminal building with no I: crowds and no queues and a i check-in time for all departures - of 10 minutes, the fastest in e Europe - but its restricted network of fights has held s back the airport's develop- a ment. y Mr Charnock said about 200,000 passengers used the air- i port annually. The airport has 3 a capacity to handle 1.7m pas- y sengers, probably as many as 2m if squeezed. It needs at least 450,000-500,000 passengers a year to break even. The runway has not been the only difficulty. Although it should only be about 15 min- utes from the City, road and rail access has so far been a handicap. That is expected to improve as road and rail links, including the Docklands light railway and the Jubilee line are completed. The airport is also served by a Riverbus every 20 minutes. The number of airlines oper- ating from the airport is expec- ted to increase. Many carriers had been waiting in the wings for the government's decision on the Â£7m extension before committing themselves to the airport. A few months ago a senior executive of a large European airline commented: \"London City is an interesting concept but it can only work if it can serve the major European busi- ness centres.\" Other airline officials have argued that the airport will also have to serve UK destinations to generate more traffic. That could include domestic services to Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh. At present Brymon, British Midland, Air France, Sabena and Flexair, a Dutch carrier, use London City. Brymon said yesterday it intended to introduce a BAe 146 service next year, while Air France confirmed that it was studying the feasibility of using other aircraft which the runway extension has made possible. Crossair, the Swiss regional airline, also said it was interested in operating BAe 146s into the airport. The big cloud on the horizon is the present depressed state of the air travel industry. Yet London 'City Airport, which plans to complete the runway construction by next spring, believes it is serving a promis- ing niche market.",

   "text_content" : "By David Gardner in Brussel THE ROW between the EC and the UK over how the British government spends the money Brussels allocates for helping declining industrial regions is poised to reach a new height today with a threat by the EC to cut off regional aid to Britain. This would be the first time this has happened since EC regional policy was reformed and its funding doubled in 1988. The row has been sparked by delays in handing over Â£100m in EC aid to former coalmining regions and centres on the fail- ure of the British government to account properly for the regional aid it receives from the EC's Ecu63bn (Â£44.2bn) v structural funds, which are a aimed largely at infrastructure t and training in the commu- v nity's declining regions. t Mr Bruce Millan, EC com- e missioner for regional policy i and former Labour Scottish v secretary, said the aid in dis- i pute could be lost to the UK if e the European Commission is t not satisfied on how it is being c spent. c His remarks come in a Radio 4 programme today, Talking v Politics, in which Mr Peter Lil- a ley, trade and industry secre- p tary, accuses Brussels of dis- a criminating against the UK. c The disputed Â£100m aid f under the Rechar programme s U -1 was ready for delivery in Janu- ary. But the commission took the view that the Tory govern- ment was using its funds enti- tlement to top up its local gov- ernment spending across the board. EC rules on regional policy require accurate target- ing on projects that would oth- erwise not go ahead, and cen- tral or local government co-financing as an indicator of commitment to the projects. In spite of several meetings with UK ministers this year in an attempt to resolve the dis- pute, according to the commis- sion the UK not only fails to comply but says it is exempt from these rules. Mr Millan says today that the Â£100m will be withdrawn unless the UK :\"plays by the rules\". Mr Lilley describes the refusal by Brussels to hand over the funds as \"discrimina- A tion against Britain\". He ii claims Mr Millan was \"making 1 difficulties all the time\" while d Britain had been as accommo- c dating as possible. \"It is never ii European money. It is our s money channelled via Brussels coming back to ourselves,\" he P says. a Mr Millan says the EC is y soon to decide on riew regional i, policy allocations and that these funds, too, are at risk. \"I b hope that this is understood by g the British government,\" he u says. t it",

   "text_content" : "By David Owen SENIOR LABOUR figures are forecasting a further blow to the left wing in tomorrow's ballot at the party's annual conference to decide the make-up of the National Execu- tive Committee. Mr Tony Benn's seat on Labour's ruling body, held for 30 years, is among those thought to be in jeopardy, chiefly because of procedural changes that are widely expec- ted to disadvantage leftwing candidates. The loss of Mr Benn would not signal a funda- mental shift in the stance of the 29-strong NEC, which is solidly behind Mr Neil Kin- nock, the party leader. Nevertheless, it would be another blow to the Labour left, which has lost ground steadily over recent years. At present only three other NEC members regularly side with Mr Benn: Mr Dennis Skin- ner, MP for Bolsover, Mr Bill Connor, of Usdaw, the shop workers' union; and Ms Barbara Switzer of the MSS general technical union. The prime beneficiary of the changes is likely to be Mr Gerald Kaufnan, shadow for- eign secretary, who last year fell 67,000 votes short of secur- ing an NEC seat. This year, for the first time, delegates are bound to cast their votes for the seven NEC members, in accordance with the results of a ballot of con- stituency party members. It is widely assumed that that will militate against perceived extremists and in favour of the Kinnock mainstream. The new procedure is also thought to have incieased the vulnerability of soft-left MP Ms Jo Richardson, the shadow cab- inet's official voice on women's issues. She finished immedi- ately behind Mr Benn in sixth place in last year's poll. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, was seventh last time, but his posi- tion may be strengthened by the changes. The four remaining NEC members chosen by the con- stituency parties are Mr David Blunkett, MP for Sheffield Brightside; Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary; Mr Skinner, and Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secrtary. Mr Benn this week criticised the new system, saying that in his constituency party of Ches- terfield it had reduced the number of participatig mem- bers and increased costs. One NEC candidates is Mr Dave Nellist, the hardleft MP for Coventry who was suspended from the party and barred fom holding ice this week. It is uncertain how votes for him will be treated.",

HM Inspectorate (HMI) will be put on a statutory basis and given the task of authorising independent teams of inspec- tors to carry out the 6,000 inspections each year. Every four years, school governors will choose an authorised team to inspect their school. The money for the inspec- tions, estimated at about Â£70m a year, will be diverted from the Â£135m at present given to local authorities for their inspection and advice func- tions. HMI itself will be cut from 480 staff to 175. A method for getting the money directly to schools has not yet been devised. The cost of each inspection is expected to vary from about Â£6,000 to more than Â£30,000. Inspection teams will have to include a member from out- side the educational establish- ment. Mr Clarke suggested a businessman, or a \"sen- sible and intelligent parent\" with management experience. Mr Clarke rejected claims that with governors paying for inspections, the inspectors were likely to be less rigorous. Mr Clarke also said the \"league tables\" of results, which will be published for all schools, would cover not just examination results but tru- ancy levels and where pupils went after leaving school.

   "text_content" : "By Ralph Atkins and Lisa Wood HEALTH workers' leaders and the Labour party responded angrily yesterday to the disclo- sure that civil servants have drawn up plans for abolishing National Health Service pay review bodies by April 1994. The government did not deny that a meeting of senior Whitehall officials had dis- cussed the devolution of pay and terms for nurses to the local level, which would end national pay rates. The Depart- ment of Health said: \"At the end of the day, ministers decide.\" Although Mr William Walde- grave, health secretary, has in the past given assurances that the pay review bodies were safe, a commitment to devolv- ing pay and conditions would undermine the role of pay review bodies. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, said: \"For all Mr Waldegrave's protesta- tions about pay review bodies being safe in his hands, he has obviously instructed his offl- cials to work out plans to effec- tively bury them.\" The document, reported in the Financial Times yesterday, shows a discussion on acceler- ating the boards' phasing-out by regional personnel directors led by Mr Eric Caines and Mr Peter Johnson, both members of the NHS management board. It is widely accepted that as health service reforms acceler- ate, pay review bodies will become irrelevant with newly created NHS trusts setting their own terms and condi- tions. Ministers, however, may decide that formal abolition of review bodies would be too politically damaging. Mr Jerry Hayes, Conserva- tive member of the Commons health select committee, said: \"It is dangerous nonsense to suggest that the government intends to abolish pay review bodies. Quite simply, they enhance the professional sta- tus of bodies such as the Royal College of Nursing and are a politically acceptable way of giving these bodies a fair crack of the whip for pay deals.\" Mr Malcolm Wing, national secretary of Nupe, the public union, said yesterday: \"Nurses are fed up with the uncertainty about their pay review body and the latest revelations add to their anger.\" He added: \"Mr Waldegrave has to clear the air - he has to back Eric Caines or sack him.\"",

There are more than 2,000 Names - the individuals whose wealth backs the under- writing market - in the US. Magistrate Joan Gottschall - to whom the case had been refered by the US District Court for the North of Illinois - ruled in favour of two Names, Mr Kenneth Bonny and Mrs Francesca Bonny. The Names, who have been members of Lloyd's since 1988 and 1990 respectively, allege that the corporation breached US securities law when it recruited them to the market. In addition, they successfully contested that Lime Street Underwriting Agency, the members' agency which han- dles their affairs, failed to dis- close full information about the nature of the risks attached to Lloyd's member- ship. The matter will now be referred to the US District Court. Charter airline ceases trading TRANS European Airways (TEA) UK, a charter airline, ceased trading yesterday after one of its aircraft was impounded at Manchester. The airport authority impounded the Boeing 737 jet outbound for the Greek island of Paphos because of non- payment of landing fees. The airline operates a fleet of five Boeing 737s and employs about 250 staff. It is a subsid- iary of the Belgian airline TEA, which is under financial pres- sure itself, and is operating under Belgian legal procedures to protect it from creditors. Pan Am legal move rejected THE COURT of Session in Edinburgh yesterday refused to grant Pan Am a court order prohibiting 385 residents of Lockerbie from suing the air- line in the US over distress claims arising from the Flight 103 disaster. Mr Michael Jones QC, for the airline, told the court that none of the 385 was injured in the disaster, but each claimed to have suffered emotional dis- tress. They were in the Locker- bie area on December 21 1988 when the Pan Am Boeing 747 crashed on the town as a result of a terrorist bomb, killing 270. He said residents would get higher damages if they were successful in the Scottish courts and they would be saved inconvenience and expense. Pan Am believed proceed- ings in Scotland would take much less time than in the US, where the cases could last two or three years. Pan Am lawyers indicated that they might appeal against the decision by Lord Kirkwood after studying his written rea- sons, to be given later. Readers misled over authorship READERS WERE misled over the authorship of two stories invented by Alistair MacLean but written by another author after his death, a court ruled in a legal test case yesterday. Publisher HarperCollins was fined Â£6,250 with Â£4,151 costs after being found guilty of five offences under the Trade Descriptions Act. Magistrates in Stratford-on- Avon took four hours, after a three-day trial, to decide that the covers of the books Death Train and Night Watch did not make clear who had written them. Warwickshire consumer offi- cials said the publisher, for- merly William Collins, breached trading standards by giving the award-winning nov- elist greater prominence than his ghost writer, Alastair Mac- Neill.",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Hughes, Law Courts Correspondent LORD SPENS, former corpo- rate finance director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, continued to help an unlawful Guinness share sup- port operation during the 1986 takeover battle for Distillers after being told by his superi- ors that it was not Ansbacher's policy to support Guinness, it was alleged yesterday. The allegation was made on the second day of the trial in which Lord Spens and Mr Roger Seelig, former director of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell - Guinness's princi- pal merchant banker for the takeover - deny criminal involvement in the support operation. They are jointly charged with conspiring to contravene the 1958 Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act by conspir- ing to induce Distillers share- holders to exchange their hold- ings for Guinness shares. Mr Seelig alone faces another charge under the same act, and two false accounting charges. Lord Spens faces one false accounting charge. Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC, prosecuting, said that on April 3 1986, at Mr Seelig's request, Lord Spens bought 100,000 Guinness shares in the name of Down Nominees, an Ansbacher nominee company. The following day he told Mr Richard Fenhalls, Ansbacher chairman, and Mr Roger Cort, head of its corporate finance division, that Mr Seelig had asked him to buy Guinness shares with an indemnity against loss. Mr Fenhalls and Mr Cort told him it was not Ansbacher policy to support Guinness, and Ansbacher should not pur- chase Guinness shares. Lord 3- Spens therefore sold the 100,000 Le shares. it Miss Gloster alleged: \"Not- n withstanding the instruction p from his chairman that Ans- 36 bacher was not to be involved 5 in any Guinness share support i- operation, Lord Spens and Mr i' Seelig continued their discus- it sions as to the possibility of clients of Ansbacher, as n opposed to Ansbacher itself, n purchasing Guinness shares.\" r Lord Spens insisted that f such transactions must not n expose Ansbacher or its clients i- to any financial risk. Mr Seelig e confirmed that they would be 1l indemnified up to Â£10m. it Miss Gloster said that, at Lord Spens' request, two Ans- d bacher clients, Dr Mohamed e Marwan, an Egyptian business- d man, and TWH Investment Co r- between them bought 2,150,000 Guinness shares on the basis I- of indemnities. After the bid closed, both s wanted to sell. Because the e share price had dropped, Mr g Seelig had been concerned that e the shares should not go on the market, and he and Lord Spens , decided they should be held by 1 Down Nominees, an Ansbacher , nominee company, until the i share price rose sufficiently for f them to be put on the market. r Ansbacher paid Â£7.6m - the clients' original purchase price r plus interest - and was cov- r ered by Guinness making an interest-free deposit of the B same amount with Ansbacher. I Mr Seelig and Lord Spens s also agreed that Guinness would not be entitled to demand repayment of the t deposit until Ansbacher had r been indemnified for any costs it incurred in acquiring or dis- posing of the shares. I Miss Gloster said that such had been Mr Seelig's and Lord Spens' concern to put the arrangements into practice that they had given insuffl- cient thought as to whether Ansbacher was buying. the shares on its own or Morgan Grenfell's behalf. Lord Spens was later to say the shares were Morgan Gren- fell's, whereas Mr Seelig said they were Ansbacher's. Miss Gloster said a mislead- ing, false and deceptive letter that Lord Spens authorised Ansbacher to send to Guinness stated that Guinness could demand repayment of the Â£7.6m deposit on a specified date and that the sum had been placed in an interest-free deposit account. The true position was that no such account had been established and the sum had been credited to Ansbacher's sundry-customers account and set off against the purchase price of the shares. When Mr Fenhalls found out about the matter, he instructed Lord Spens to liaise with Mr Seelig and get written confir- mation firom Morgan Grenafell that Ansbacher was entitled to indemnify itself out of the deposit. Mr Seelig refused to give such confirmation. However, Miss Gloster said, he later told a Morgan Grenfell colleague that Ansbacher had been given an indemnity. Lord Spens and Mr Seelig had given contradictory accounts to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors who later investigated the takeover, Miss Gloster said. Lord Spens, who denied having done anything dishonest, even- tually admitted that Mr Seelig had asked him to support Tony Andrews Elizabeth Gloster QC arrives at Southwark Crown Court Guinness and given an indem- nity up to Â£10m. Mr Seelig had denied having given Lord Spens an indem- nity, saying he had given noth- ing more than \"comfort\" and that it had been no more than \"a loose back-scratching arrangement - that is, you do me a favour now and I will not forget you in the future\". Miss Gloster said the princi- pal issues were simple: * Had indemnities been given? * If so, had they been con- cealed? 4 If they had been concealed, had that been done dishon- estly? * Had false and dishonest documentation been used to cover up indemnity payments? Those issues, she said, were to be considered against the background that the vice of undisclosed indemnities was that Distillers shareholders had not been making informed decisions about whether to accept the Guinness offer or that of its rival bidder, Argyll. , The trial resumes on Mon- day.",

The report describes the past year as \"intensely disappoint- ing\". It said there had been 18 cases in which objects valued collectively at Â£39.5m were sub- ject to a temporary export ban to allow British galleries and museums to make bids to keep them in the UK. Only seven works of art, with a value of Â£3m, had been retained. Six objects, valued at a total Â£23m, including the Badminton i cabinet, received export - licences. I The committee said it had little confidence that the four i outstanding cases, valued at a total of Â£13.5m and including : paintings by Constable and Van Dyck, would end with the I works remaining in the UK. I One case has been withdrawn. The committee said: \"The I tax system should be modified I so that it is more attractive for private owners to make private treaty arrangements when they have an important heri- I tage object for sale. The opera- tion of gift tax should also be I improved so that works of art i can be offered in lieu of tax. \"Our public collections should be better funded and should have access to special grants in exceptional cases in order to make pre-emptive pur- chases and to take advantage of private treaty offers when they, are made.\" The report notes that the Badminton cabinet was offered to the Victoria and Albert Museum for Â£4m before being sold at auction for Â£8.6m. Mr Tim Renton, the arts minister, has asked the com- mittee to propose improve- ments to export controls. An alternative system could be in place by the time of the 1992 report.",

   "text_content" : "By Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent A RECOVERY in the UK truck market, where sales have more than halved in the past two years, is unlikely before the second quarter of 1992, the Retail Motor Industry Federa- tion warned yesterday. Mr Mike Mudie, chairman of the federation's national truck committee, said that truck pro- ducers had been forced to offer substantial financial support to their dealer networks. \"There would be very few that would still be in business without that support,\" he said. The truck sector has been one of the worst sufferers in the recession. Sales are 38 per cent lower than in 1990 and there has been a 56 per cent fall in demand over the past two years. Truck prices in the UK are currently the lowest in western Europe, said Mr Mudie, and were only 70 per cent to 75 per cent of prices in Germany. He warned that the industry faced a further wave of restructuring in order to reduce overcapacity, and said that there would be more casu- alties among the remaining small truck makers. Sales of new commercial vehicles fell 29.2 per cent in August to 28,946, led by a fur- ther steep drop in truck demand. New commercial vehicle sales in the first eight months of this year, at 151,107, were 30.3 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago. The rate of decline and the depth of the recession in the UK commercial vehicles mar- ket was unprecedented in the post-1945 period, Mr David Gill, truck marketing and sales managing director for Leyland DAS, the UK subsidiary of DAS of the Netherlands, warned recently. The present recession was biting much more deeply than the last recession, in the early 1980s. He forecast that sales of trucks above 3.5 tonnes would fall as low as 32000 this year - a drop of a third from the 48,000 last year and less than half the 1989 sales level of 69,000.",

It proposes that two of the Paternoster Associates' build- ings should be set back to achieve the vista and allow a way through Newgate Street to the new Paternoster Square.

Acorn, based in Cambridge, has machines in 85 per cent of UK schools, with a bias towards the primary sector, where its BBC-B computer has been especially popular. The company has been critic- ised, however, for concentrat- ing on its own proprietary hardware and software rather than developing computers based on the industry standard MS-DOS operating system used on most professional machines. , The new A5000 machine uses Acorn's own microprocessor chip, but the company says it is so fast that it can run MS- DOS programs almost as fast as MS-DOS-based computers. The A5000, complete with a 40-megabyte hard disk memory and colour monitor, will sell for Â£1,499 plus VAT. Mr Sam Wauchope, Acorn managing director, said the machine was well suited to sec- ondary schools' use as well as to desktop publishing and multi-media applications where text, moving pictures and computer processing are brought together on the moni- tor screen. He said the education mar- ket, seriously shaken over the past two years by the uncer- tainties of the poll tax and the introduction of local manage- ment of schools, had returned to slow but steady growth. The National Curriculum in England and Wales requires schools to use computers in specific subjects such as maths, science and technology. Some schools are exploiting applications such as word pro- ceasing for English, grphics in art classes and spreadsheets for business studies.",

   "text_content" : "A HAMPSHIRE businessman given an 18-month jail sen- tence last year for his alleged involvement in a Â£439,000 fraud on investors was cleared by the Court of Appeal yesterday. Mr David Day had denied duping clients into investing in bogus offshore companies in the mid 1980s. The court quashed his con- viction on four counts alleging unlawful inducement of invest- ment and set aside his sen- tence. Mr Day, who operated in Southampton, had been allowed bail pending appeal after being convicted at South- ampton Crown Court in Febru- ary last year. Lord Justice Farquharson said Mr Day was alleged to have operated a swindle with two Dutchmen, who had never been traced. Mr Day said he acted merely as a selling agent and had no control over the companies concerned. He honestly believed the projects were genuine. The prosecution held that he had acted recklessly. The appeal judge said the case had been complicated and called for clear legal directions to be given to the jury. The trial judge's directions on the question of dishonesty had not been sufficient and those on recklessness flawed. It had also been argued that the judge's summing up was delivered at a pace that made it difficult for the jury to understand. Lord Justice Farquharson said: \"We took the unusual course of listening to a tape- recording of part of the sum- ming-up and we can only say we found it measured and easy to understand.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Peter Norman, Economics Correspondent THE FINANCIAL health of Britain's companies improved in the second quarter of this year, but consumers saved less as their real disposable income fell. Seasonally adjusted figures, released yesterday by the Cen- tral Statistical Office, showed that the UK corporate sector increased its gross trading profits, net of stock apprecia- tion, by 4.3 per cent to Â£l17.5bn from the first to the second quarter. Dividend payments were pared by nearly 24 per cent to Â£4.37bn in the second quarter compared with the first, while corporate savings in the form of undistrib- uted income increased by 52 per cent to an estimated Â£9.14bn. Higher profits, large destock- ing and falling investment left Britain's industrial and com- mercial companies with a second-quarter financial deficit of Â£1.81bn: a big improvement compared with the first quar- ter's Â£5.52bn deficit and the record Â£25.44bn deficit for the whole of last year. While corporate finances recovered, the personal sector suffered a 0.9 per cent drop in real personal disposable income in the second quarter compared with the previous three months. Pre-tax income from wages and salaries increased by only 0.2 per cent from the first to the second quarter as rising unemployment largely offset the effects of higher incomes for those in work. The effect of unemployment also showed up strongly in the annual figures. Overall income from wages and salaries increased by 4.9 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 1990, while the rise in average earnings over the same period was about 8 per cent. The savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total personal disposable income, fell to 10.1 per cent in the second quarter from 10.8 per cent in the two preceding quarters. It was well above the 4.1 per cent low reached in the first quarter of 1988 at the time of the boom. Economists said the second- quarter personal income and savings data helped to explain why the recovery of consumer demand had been muted so far this year. According to Mr Michael Saunders, UK econo- mist for Salomon Brothers International in London, a sharper fall in the savings ratio will be required if Britain is to experience a strong consumer-led recovery. That would be unlikely, he said. The CSO's figures have been revised to give a more positive picture of the financial health of the corporate sector over much of the past decade. The gross profits of non-oil compa- nies last year, for example, are now shown to have been Â£65.3bn, compared with Â£57.8bn previously. Mr Kevin Gardiner of War- burg Securities warned that the inclusion of recently priva- tised electricity companies had inflated the CSO's profit statis- tics in the first half. However, he forecast that the second- quarter improvement in the corporate financial deficit would be sustained."

   "text_content" : "IT IS a truth universally acknowledged that elections can be bought. What matters, it is widely believed, is how well off voters feel on the eve of the poll. A few months of low rates of interest and rising incomes are enough, it is alleged, to make the average voter forget all earlier pains. But this truth may be a half-truth, or even a falsehood. The economics of the moment may matter less than is thought: They certainly should matter less than is thought. If the electorate were to ask the Conservative party what it has done for it lately, its lead- ers would happily point to a 4%' percentage point reduction in base rates since October of last year, along with a stable currency and signs of eco- nomic recovery. But if the elec- torate were to ask what the party has done for it since June 1987, when last it received a lease on the powers of a British government in pos- session of a House of Commons majority, the answer would be far grimmer. In the four years since the second quarter of 1987, the UK's gross domestic product has risen by a paltry 5.5 per cent (a compound annual rate of growth of 1.3 per cent). Retail price inflation, less mortgage interest - Mr Nigel Lawson's \"judge and jury\" - was 3.5 per cent in the year to June 1987, but 6.2 per cent in the year to August 1991. Aver- age earnings rose at an under- lying rate of 7% per cent in the year to June 1987 and by 7%V per cent in the year to July 1991. In June 1987, unemploy- ment was 2.9m and falling. In August 1991 it was down to 2.4m, but rising. None of this looks very good and some of it looks dreadful. Given that the latest recession did not coincide with oil shocks and global recessions comparable to those of 1973-75 and 1979-81, it is also bound to look unnecessary. Likely growth Just how deep and long the recession has been has become clearer with the publication of GDP for the second quarter of 1991. If one defines a recession in terms of successive quarters , of negative growth, then the latest one is already four quar- ters old. It is also quite likely - though far from certain - to be at its end, since some growth, albeit modest, is likely in the third quarter. With a GDP decline of 3.7 per cent over four quarters, the lat- est recession has not been as deep as the 6.7 per cent decline between the second quarter of 1979 and the last quarter of 1980. But it is already deeper than the 3.4 per cent decline between the third quarter of manufacturing output has fallen by \"only\" 6.6 per cent from its peak in the second quarter of 1990. It is easy to understand why manufactur- ing industry should feel groggy by now, but this time services too have been pummelled. Two options The government has two options in dealing with e leg- acy of its past. It can blame it all on a previous government, headed by someone called Mar- garet Thatcher, who was exe- cuted last November and bur- ied in an unmarked grave. The government is now headed, instead, by a certain John Major who happened to arrive from Mars at the same time. The government can also try to point to a bright future of non-inflationary growth. Growth is, indeed, now rather likely. It is noteworthy, for example, that the personal savings ratio, whose increase in 1989 and 1990 was an impor- tant proximate cause of the recession, stopped rising in the first half of 1991. Consumption should now rise with personal incomes. Moreover, the decline in gross trading profits halted in the second quarter of 1991, while that in corporate fixed investment also slowed sharply. In addition, the vol- ume of exports (excluding oil and erratic items) went up 2% per cent in the latest quarter over the previous one. All in all, recovery now looks likely. Nonetheless, economic growth is unlikely to match the rise in capacwit h fur- ther increases in unemploy- ment certain. Moreover, the UK has not, whatever the polted- ticians claim, \"licked infla- tion\", if that means a pay per- formance rivalling the best in Europe. The governments tale is one ume of pastexpormistakes, of a dreary present and a far from buoyant future. But the Labour party is so frightened of being thought reckless that it offers the same basic policies. This time at least the electorate will not be bought. On the contrary, it is being offered a hair shirt. The Labour party is entitled to belabour the gMoreovernment for its mistakes. But no one should be fooled. As Henry Ford would have said, the electorate can have any macroeconomic colour it wants, so long as it is basic policies. This time at black. 1974 and the last quarter of 1975. The Thatcher-Major recession is, in fact, the second deepest decline in output since the 1930s. The latest recession is also quite different in shape from the earlier ones. In 1979-80, manufacturing experienced a decline of 17.4 per cent. Even in 1974-75 the decline was 11.8 per cent. This time, however,",

   "text_content" : "By Bronwen Maddox \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t I don't see any reason to be frightened. We've just got a job to do and if you were easily scared you'd be in the wrong job out here.\" This deadpan American style belongs to Mr David Kay, chief of the United Nations inspec- tion team which this week uncovered the frightening scale of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Mr Kay and his 43 colleagues were detained in the car park of the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's nuclear weapons pro- gramme for four days with a UN bus and five cars. They were in a deadlock with Iraqi officials who initially refused to let them remove sensitive files said to reveal for the first time the full extent of Iraq's nuclear weapons-making capa- bility, but eventually backed down on Friday night. The US and UN have rejected vigorously Iraq's claim that Mr Kay is a Central Intel- ligence Agency officer. Clean-cut, and neatly-built with an energetic shirt-sleeves style, Kay, 51, has been thrust from his normal role as part- bureaucrat, part-scientist into the front line of media atten- tion. He is the antithesis of General Norman Schwartzkopf, the last American desert hero to fill the television screens. Relaxed and chatty over the crackling satellite link to his car phone in Baghdad, he said during their detention: \"We're not actually sleeping on the bus - it's far too hot We sleep on the pavement by the cars, and in the morning it looks like a convention of the home- less. But you'd be surprised - with a layer of cardboard between you and the concrete it's quite tolerable.\" That, according to his col- leagues in Vienna, was not bra- vado but typical of his low-key approach. He seemed uninter- ested in the discomfort, not bothered by military rations and the one \"truly horrible\" lavatory facility for 44 people, although he said ruefully \"we brought no razors and we've got a whole variety of whiskers and beards\". The real frustration for him was spending four days penned in a car park unable to pursue the evidence that he knows exists. He says the \"hammer fell\" and the team was ejected by Iraqi soldiers as they began examining one room holding finance and personnel records for the huge Iraqi weapons pro- gramme. They had already ferried some papers out of the two 12- storey buildings, running with them down the stairs in 40-de- gree Centigrade heat as the lifts were too dangerous to use. They stored the papers under the seats of the bus and settled down to wait for New York and Vienna to tell them whether the United Nations Security Council and Iraq could agree the terms for a fll inspection of the building. Kay is on his fifth mission to Iraq since he was appointed head of the investigation in April. He joined the Interna- tional Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog, in 1983. Until April he was the head of the IAA's technical co0P9R tkn section, which helps devel- oping countries manage nuclear energy for peaceful uses, mainly in medicine and agriculture, \"It is easier to say which countries I didn't visit in Africa, Asia, Latin Amer- ica,\" he says. Born in Texas, he studied physics there as an undergrad- uate, and then took a doctorate of philosophy in public law and government at Columbia. It was there that he realised his real love was the politics and economics of science. A spell in Washington doing research on a grant from the National Science Foundation gave him a taste of the influ- ence of the east coast establish- ment, an east coast edge to his accent and the springboard for his first European job, a Paris- based post at Unesco. Having made the leap from his home town, he seems rap- idly to have acquired the inter- national technocrat's ability to feel at home anywhere. That may explain his dispas- dsonate pproch to his Iraqi custodians, bantering with them in the car park as they bdisu how to make an accept- able inventory of the files. He sbows a surprising lack of anger in describing the inci- a dent earlier this week when Iraqi officials forcibly stripped i1 boxes of files from a UN truck b and returned only the less sen- i sitive ones, in an unannounced a visit to his bedroom at 130 in a the morning. 11 This accommodating a approach seems almost a a refusal to pass judgment when n he talks about Vienna, his fam- p ily's home for the past eight years. \"It's a beautiful city, tl with an interesting culture and r history, as you can see from d the buildings, and a vibrant interational community.\" h Unmistakeably, his fluency h and real enthusiasm are d reserved for his expeditions - abroad. He has a boyish fasd- e nation for technology, and helps listeners with free-hand a maps of the Iraqi desert and a electromagnetic uranium iso- a tope facilities. a In earlier missions to Iraq tl his teams were racing against a \"massive obstruction\" by Iraqi ti soldiers. Returning to re-in- c spect sites, they found equip- b ment bulldozed, concreted th over, dragged out into the des- k ert and buried. They had to dig pieces of 24-ton electro-mag- nets out of the desert and reas- semble them before they real- ised they were looking at factories for uranium enrich- ment, an essential step in mak- ing nuclear weapons. When they intercepted a 60- truck convoy carrying equip- ment away from Tarmiya, an enrichment site east of Bagh- dad, they were shot at by Iraqi officials. Even that high point of drama seems not to trouble him: \"You do what comes nat urally to survive - it doesn't occur to you to be afraid.\" His ability to \"interface\" as he calls it, with politics and science, bureaucracy and adventure is the reason he nev- ertheless fits well among the inhabitants of the trio of curved United Nations build- ings on the banks of the Dan- ube. His colleagues in Vienna refer to him with respect and some excitement - not quite Lawrence of Arabia, but an exotic animal in the climate controlled corridors of the UN. They were particularly impressed when he brought back fragments of equipment in his suitcase from the last mission, and assembled them on the floor of the UN offices. It was only when the pieces were all in place that observers could see that western compa- nies had supplied some crucial parts. But he gives no impression that he has fallen for the romance of expeditions, nor does he urge others to carry out dangerous deeds. He says he is pleased and relieved that his 25-year-old daughter has chosen to be a tax accountant - it means she will always be employed. His colleagues in Vienna want him back soon to assess what has been collected. They may have a tough negotiatila ahead of them. Laughing over the phone line, he says: \"We've still days of work here, and tat's assuming there isn't a .r park situation at every iding we go to. I just want to get on with it. Vienna knows that.\"",

   "text_content" : "The Labour party conference will provide the party leader with the sternest test he could face before the election, writes Ivo Dawnay S hortly after 2.30pm on Tues- day, Mr Neil Kinnock will step up to the speaker's rostrum of the Labour party conference, nervously adjust his shirt cuffs and begin the most important speech of his political career. In the tense hush that follows will hang a widely held, though unspoken, conviction that his 45-minute address will set the tone of Labour's coming campaign and will Influence his chances of becoming prime minister next year. The goals of the Labour leader's speech, hammered out at the shadow cabinet meeting in London's Chur- chill Hotel 10 days ago, are simple but demanding. Mr Kinnock's chief task is to paint a picture of Britain under a Labour government, drawing out the vision from' the mountain of policy papers so painstakingly drafted over the past three years. His speech must answer the charge that the reformed Labour party's mes- sage is all things to all men, and explain what \"democratic socialism\" stands for. It must convey to the elec- tors the complex, though not neces- sarily contradictory, message that Labour is both safe and exciting to vote for. And, above all, it must go at least some way to rebutting the jibe of Mr Chris Patten, the Tory chairman, that a Kinnock premiership offers only a return to the pragmatism of Harold Wilson. How will Mr Kinnock promote the new Labour party? On its traditional winning issues - the National Health Service and education, for example - the leader will assure his audience that it stands for \"modernisation not privatisation\": a formula that finds ample support at the polls. On the more difficult area of the economy, Mr Kinnock will push hard on the button marked \"prudence\" while emphasising that Labour's 'We are usually bad under fire. But the party behaved like a good battalion last week' - Roy Hattersley investment-led recovery programme, with its emphasis on manufacturing innovation and skills training, is the European norm, and Tory dependence on market forces an aberration. But none of this answers the ques- tion: \"What is the big idea?\" After months of debate, the shadow cabinet concluded that the party must high- light the constitutional reform chap- ter of its policy package. In deliberate contrast to Mr John Major's Citizen's Charter - dismissed as a narrow consumerist view of citi- zenship rights by Labour - Mr Kin- nock will point to the little-publicised programme for a Freedom of Informa- tion Act, devolved regional govern- ment and widely enhanced citizens' rights as the agenda for pushing for- ward the frontier of a true \"enabling\" democracy. Upon this agenda, Mr Kinnock will try to restore Labour's claims to excitement and to win votes as the party determined to empower the peo- ple. But what will he say on the cru- cial, related question of electoral reform? The signals this week were that Mr Kinnock, until recently a declared agnostic, will use his conference speech to boost the hopes of the grow- ing ranks of reformers now lobbying hard within the party. Opponents to changes in Britain's first-past-the-post voting system, including the deputy Labour leader, Mr Roy Hattersley, believe there are compelling reasons why Mr Kinnock should say nothing. Others, like the shadow health secretary, Mr Robin Cook, think that now is the moment for the Labour leader, at the very least, to wave what may be a trump card. The case for caution is simple. Labour goes to its conference with its morale higher for the electoral race than at any time since it last won power 17 years ago in October 1974. The most recent polls show the party returning to a two- or three-point lead as the public's attention shifts back from the unfolding events in the Soviet Union and elsewhere to the domestic political agenda. Indeed, even when the polls were running against it two weeks ago, Labour's disciplined new model army held its ground. \"We are usually bad under fire. But the party behaved like a good battalion last week,\" Mr Hat- tersley observed with satisfaction. Inevitably, there will be conference controversies. Nuclear defence policy, women's quotas in the selection of MPs, electoral reform itself, and, now the suspension of the memberships of the two hard-left MPs linked to the Militant Tendency - Mr Dave Nellist and Mr Terry Fields - could all cause temporary upsets. And if Mr Kinnock even tentatively raises the electoral reform flag, its opponents warn, he will hand Mr Pat- ten the opportunity to claim that Labour is planning for defeat because it cannot win under the present rules. But, the reformers argue, if we are committed to extending democracy, then at least send out that signal now and reap the electoral benefits. The party's campaign co-ordinator, Mr Jack Cunningham, believes Labour's electoral fate hangs on broader issues. He concedes, however, that there is work to be done to win votes. \"Earlier this year we saw our own vote steady and others oscillating between the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. It is some of those that we must now win for Labour,\" he said. For Mr Kinnock the options, at least, are clear cut. On the one hand he could simply ignore the pressure from the reformers by sticking strictly to his formula that the party's internal debate continues. Or he could signal, however slightly, that a Labour government may agree to place the question of voting systems on the national agenda - possibly by means of a speaker's conference, a constitutional convention or a royal commission - when it takes office. The Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform - now the party's biggest sin- gle pressure group - is proposing a still more cautious course through a skilfully drafted conference resolution and is inviting the party's ruling national executive committee to endorse it. Highlighting the balanced prelimi- nary work of the party's working party on electoral systems, chaired by Professor Raymond Plant, the motion calls on the party: \"to seize every opportunity to publicise and discuss Labour's new openness to electoral reform\". If the NEC gives that wording its blessing, Labour, the reformers claim, can enter the election campaign with at least a portion of the two-point increase in its vote that the Electoral Reform Society says the party would attract for a full-bloodied endorse- ment of change. s7 -- While the backroom politicking over electoral reform rages internally, the chief battleground outside the conference hall continues to centre on Labour's struggle for credibility over its ability to manage the economy. For Mr Kinnock and Mr John Smith, his shadow chancellor, it is the Trea- sury not the NHS that must be proved to be \"safe in our hands\". The latest findings of the party's private polling show that Labour leads the Tories comfortably on its promises of more aid to manufactur- ing investment and on skills training, but it continues to lag badly on the broader question of relative \"eco- nomic competence\". To win over the skilled and semi- skilled workers, the crucial C2s, Labour intends to use the conference to stress its new European creden- tials. The market is a useful tool, it will claim, but the Tories' dogmatic faith in its virtues is eschewing cru- cial measures, widely employed across the Channel, needed to prepare the country for the single market of 1992. Enhanced tax breaks for invest- ment and better skills training have allowed the UK's European partners to establish stable economic growth and a dangerous competitive advan- tage. \"A key element in the message is that our policy is the norm in Europe,\" said one shadow cabinet member. \"It is the Tories who are out of line.\" What is worrying for Labour is that, so far, this message is still' not feeding through into its poll flnigl As Mr Smith and his team repeatedly out-point their Conservative counter- parts for personal credibility, anaylsts conclude that the problem centres on a \"cultural\" association in the minhds of the electorate that the Tories intu- itively understand money. This week Mr Smith once again pro- moted his image as a cautious Scots- man by assuring the FT that Labour's commitments on spending are defini- tively restricted to increases in child benefit and pensions. Whatever the priorities of his colleagues, he said in an interview, all additional cash must come from the increased tax revenues derived from growth - money the Tories would spend on tax cuts. But how does this publicly-declared parsi- mony mesh with the plethora of promises listed in the 51 policy docu- ments Labour has published over the past 12 months. To many, the well-tried formula that programmes will be funded \"as resources allow\" rings no more true than the Tories' joyous poster slogan: \"Labour's going for broke again.\" Professor Paul Hurst, of Birkbeck College, believes that, at its root, the public's lack of confidence must relate to Labour's continuing proximity to the unions, a relationship which came at the top of the list of \"reasons for not voting Labour\" in a recent Observer/NOP opinion poll. Memories of the 1978-79 \"winter of discontent\" have not been dispelled despite the assurances of Mr Tony Blair, Labour's fluent young employ- ment secretary, that neither a social contract nor an incomes policy will be on offer when the party takes power. \"The Labour party in the 1970s ended up taking responsibility for things outside its power,\" he remarked. \"That is not going to happen again.\" Mr Blair is one of the inner circle who believes that the relentless press onslaught against the Labour leader and the phoney election of the past few weeks has exhausted the Tories' best ammunition on the \"leadership issue\" and may provoke a \"sympa- thy\" backlash. Indeed, loyalist party officials say that the discipline and determination of Mr Kinnock's conference - not to mention the ousted Militants outside the door - will serve as the crucial curriculum vitae item in his applica- tion to manage Great Britain pic. His iron grip on the NEC and his shadow cabinet have shown that he is in com- plete control of a party once notorious for its unmanageability. For the Tories, Labour's credibility has been fatally undermined by its about-turns on public ownership, uni- lateralism, and now, possibly, propor- tional representation. In particular, the Tories say, Labour's new-found Euro-enthusiasm is symptomatic of its tendency to put electoral opportun- ism before serious policy consider- ations. In the run-up to the EC sum- mit at Maastricht in December, they claim, Labour is ready to jeopardise British national interests merely to capture Downing Street. But how much will all this matter to the C2 voters the party is seeking to woo? As one campaigner protested: \"Either we are extremists or we have changed. The Tories cannot have it both ways.\" Labour's official answer in Brighton this week is that, unlike the ideologi- cal Tories, its policies have moved with the times while its principles remain firmly embedded in the pur- suit of a more equitable society - a country, to borrow Mr John Major's phrase, more \"at ease with itself\". That may be true. But as Mr Kin- nock sits down to the inevitable rap- turous applause next Tuesday, he may privately concede that the vision of democratic socialism he has just unveiled is almost identical to that once tabled by the late and little lamented, SDP. Perhaps the only dif- ference is that Labour now has the history, organisation and resources that its rebel offshoot lacked.",

   "text_content" : "From Mr JD Gmham. Sir, Re Mr Martin Angel's discussion (Letters, September 16) of how to encourage the provision of rented accommo- dation, no one in the govern- ment, or outside it, ever appears to recall the history of rented furnished accommoda- tion and the reason for the lack of it, which is the 1974 Rental Act which gave security of ten- ure to furnished tenants. In the seven months or thereabouts before the acT becoming law, rented fur- nished accommodation practi- cally vanished in the UK. The reason was that an 18-year-old university student could rent a room and, provided he paid the controlled rent, coud die in it and his son could inherit under the same conditions. London University students the next term were sleeping in sleeping bags in the corridors of the university. In the block of four terraced houses where we lived we rented two flats and a maison- ette; our immediate neighbour rented four beautifully arranged bed-sitters; and one of the remaining two houses rented two rooms. Within 12 months of this act, the block was empty except for one long-term tenant of ours. In 1978 or 1979, just before the Tory landslide, a report on the effects of this legislation was prepared on the iastruc- tions of Mr Peter Shore and This legislation has destroyed the bridge between living at home and buying a house and is largely responsi- ble for the number of tragic repossessions that we are see- ing taking place now.

   "text_content" : "The federal army has withdrawn from Croatia. Judy Dempsey on the options facing Yugoslavia he last bastion of the Yugo- slav federation crumbled earlier this week when the Serb-dominated federal army agreed to withdraw from the repub- lic of Croatia. That accord, and the ceasefire between Croatia, Serbia and Mr Veljko Kadijevic, the defence minister, may signal the beginning of a long road towards achieving stability in the Balkans. There will be senior army offi- cers who remain wedded to the idea that the territorial unity of the Yugoslav federation must be main- tained at all costs. But the way in which young, hastily-recruited reservists responded to Croatia's show of force this week demon- strated that they did not have the stomach to continue shooting civil- ians, or bombarding towns and cities on Yugoslav territory. The army capitulated for many reasons. It was not prepared to fight in Croatia, mobilise units in the central republic of Bosnia-Her- cegovina, and maintain a blockade on Croatia's western ports all at the same time. Its morale was also ebbing quickly. Recruits were deserting, senior officers defecting, and some had committed suicide. Above all, the army realised that everything it was doing was con- trary to what it set out to preserve: the Yugoslav federation. Its offen- sive in Slovenia last June, and in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, had the opposite effect: it precipi- tated the federation's collapse. The army itself blames Yugo- slavia's political leaders for destroying the federation, particu- larly Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia. Historians may agree. They are likely to argue that Mr Milosevic's policies - the forcible integration into Serbia of the ethnic-Albanian southern province of Kosovo, and the attempt to carve out a greater Serbia from Croatia and Bosnia- Hercegovina - all led inexorably to the violent end of the Yugoslav experiment. The question is what happens next. One of the main issues is whether democracy will be able to arise from the ruins of the old fed- eration. The omens, for the moment, are not good. Although the federal army is disintegrating, the future lies in the hands of poli- ticians poorly equipped to create strong democratic institutions. Without exception, the leaders of the six republics were elected last year on a bandwagon of national- ism. The might of the federal army may be dead but the force of nationalism is alive. Nowhere is it more forceful, or more poisonous, than in relations between Serbs and Croats, the two ethnic groups which hold the key to stability. Earlier this week, the Croat gov- ernment said it would regain all territories seized by Serb paramili- tary units. If it succeeds, it will still have to contend with the sta- tus of the 600,000 Serbs who make up 12 per cent of the republic's 4.5m population. The most militant Serbs, who live in the Krajina, a poor, undevel- oped part of south-western Croatia, have insisted that they will not live in an independent Croatia. Observ- ers think Croatia should give up the Krajina for the sake of peace. But politically, this would be sui- cidal for Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia. \"If we are seen to negotiate, ceding one inch of territory to the Serbs, the Serbs will want more and more in years to come,\" an adviser to Mr Tudjman commented. \"Mr Tudjman would then fall.\" The intense anti-Serb nationalist atmosphere in Croatia, fuelled by the desire to seek revenge after the destruction of many towns and vil- lages in eastern Croatia, does little to open the way for negotiations on the future status of Krajina, let alone encourage some rapproche- ment between Serbs and Croats in the republic. Over the past few weeks, the more liberal, and assim- ilated, Serbs in Croatia's cities and towns have become the targets of death threats by extreme right- wing Croatian nationalists, as well as smear campaigns by the heavily- censored and nationalist Croatian press. Serbs, for instance, are accused of being disloyal to the republic. Mr Milorad Pupovac, head of the Serbian Democratic Forum, a mod- erate movement which seeks recon- ciliation between Serbs and Croats, says Serbs must be granted a wide degree of autonomy within Croatia. \"We do not want to be part of greater Serbia. Nor do we want to leave Croatia. We must have our own autonomous political and cul- tural rights in this republic,\" he argued. But Mr Pupovac, whose life has been repeatedly threatened, is one of the few voices of moderation in Croatia. He and likeminded liberal intellectuals argue that no matter whether the present ceasefire holds, the Serbs in KraJina would fight to the bitter end rather than live in an Independent Croatia. At the same time, the liberals believe that Croat nationalists, grouped around the extreme nationalist Croatian Party of Rights, would fight to regain all the territories seized by the Serbs, would try to hold on to the Krajina, and would even attempt to incorpo- rate Croat-inhabited regions of Bos- nia-Hercegovina into the republic of Croatia. \"Mr Tudjman is an impossible position,\" said Mr Pupovac. \"If he wants to survive, he cannot afford to be seen negotiating away territo- ries. No matter what rights he grants the Serbs in Krajina, they will not accept them. We could have guerrilla warfare here, inspired and orchestrated by fascist movements. It will be tests difficult to build democracy in Coatia.\" Building democracy in neigh- bouring Serbia is equally frught. Mr Milosevic, who ha sttfered a serious setback in his eqebt for a greater Serbia, is now Addled with a disgruntled, emasculated army, rebellious ethnic Albanians in Kos- ovo, and the rise of the extremist Chetnik movement. Like Mr Tudi- man, Mr Milosevic is behold6n to Serbia's nationalitt-fascidt move- ment. Serbia's Chethiks will not give up Kosovo, or the rfitIa. The Croatian Party of Rights wIP not negotiate any of its lands away. It is unclear what role the Euro- pean Community can pla in isolat- ing these extremist movueents. At present, the EC is settigi up an arbitration committee *hich will look at how Yugoslavik's ipternal borders can be redraWai. The EC will have to tread caretully. It will have to weigh up the political costs of keeping Mr Tudjtnan and Mr Mil- osevic in power, against the possi- bility of negotiating a lasting solu- tion to the Yugosldt brisis. The future of the two ptesidents hangs in the balance.",

   "text_content" : "From Ms Elizabeth Clements. Sir, Recently we have heard much of the prime minister's ambition to create a society of opportunity which rewards people on merit. The \"Citizen's Charter\" was heralded as the start of a new age of account- ability for public industries and institutions. In my experi- ence, reality is somewhat dif- ferent. Despite having taken a first- class degree from Oxford Uni- versity this year I have not been awarded funding for post- graduate studies by the British Academy. My disappointment is shared by more than 100 holders of first-class degrees or MAs with distinction. The Brit- ish Academy is now turning away well-qualified candidates because of a severe shortage of government funds: to me this represents a narrowing of opportunity and a waste of tal- ent which cannot be reconciled with the government's stated aims. The British Academy refuses to give any reasons for its deci- sions, or to publish any statis- tics relating to its competition. Surely this is now an untena- ble position for a public body charged with distributing tax- payers' money. Elizabeth Clements, 36 Roxwell Road, Chelmsford CM1 2NB Essex",

   "text_content" : "From Mr Ian Pleeth. Sir, Michael Skapinker, in his article, \"BT pledges on ser- vices to customers published\" (September 21), reports BT's words accurately; I know, because I received a letter addressed to me from Philip Mounsey, who, according to BT, is its campaign manager, customer services, Bristol. He states: \"We'll guarantee that, if a fault does occur on your line, we'll fix it within one working day. If we fail to meet this deadline, you'll be able to claim the cost of one month's line rental for every day it takes until your line is fixed.\" At about this time I had \"a fault\" on my line. We are a village of only nine houses with more than one \"Martha Woodforde\" in our \"Am- bridge\". A neighbour and I had a crossed line, which meant that under these circumstances our telephones were more than useless. It took more than one week to \"untangle\" our lines and so be able to talk with confidenti- ality, but when we approached BT for compensation we were informed that \"a fault\" is not enough. It appears that BT's pledge on their repair deadline only applies to a dead line. I telephoned Bristol to get Mr Mounsey's comments. He has not returned my calls.

We only use three custodians, all of whom are product specialists with com- plete global coverage. This arrangement works well. The critical mass for run- ning a cost effective network of sub-custodians is very high, even with access to SWIFT. Communication links are only part of the difficulty: sub-custo- dian management is an inten- sive user of management time, and large suppliers inevitably have more leverage. With good quality global custody now available, local suppliers are less attractive. Our view is that investment managers will increasingly use single global networks of cus- todians, the opposite of what you suggest.

Today they are two. a penny. The noise of yet another boardroom coup has become one of the characteris- tic features of Britain's present recession. The departure of Professor Sir Roland Smith from British Aerospace late on Wednesday was simply one of the more spectacular in a succession of high-profile exits from compa- nies large and small. Top exec- utives are finally, it seems, being held accountable for fail- ure. But by whom? And why has the climate in the board- room become so much tougher? The conventional explana- tion is that the big investment institutions are finally flexing their muscles after decades of complaining that it was not their job to act as productivity chasers by appointment to British industry. And to a point this is true. The institu- tions: have recently played an important part in removing unsuccessful chairmen and chief executives at a number of medium-sized companies - almost single-handedly, in the case of Norwich Union at the environmental engineering group TACE, or collectively at paper and packaging group Bunzl and food retailer Bud- gens. Equally striking has been the way the big insurance com- panies and pension funds are no longer prepared to act as limp-wristed, passive providers of capital. Industrial managers ani even bankers now know that institutional support in capital-raising operations is conditional on boardroom change where the rights issue is dicted at- redressing bal- ance-sheqt' Idamage arising from last-eors.' ' An obvious victim here was Mr Derek Lewis, the former chief executive of Granada, who was held responsible for a diversification programme that had failed to pay off. The dem- onstration effect has reverber- ated around the corporate sec- tor in such a way as to prompt pre-emptive change. At food retailer Asda the knowledge that fresh equity would be difficult to raise with- out a change of regime at the top contributed to the depar- ture of its chairman and chief executive, Mr John Hardman. The fear that institutions might not support a British Aerospace rights issue with Sir Roland Smith still in the driv- ing seat provided a powerful lever to those members of the BAe board who wished to oust the otherwise limpet-like pro- fessor. In part the increased effec- tiveness of institutional pres- sure simply reflects the growth of the institutions' stake in British industry and com- merce, which now approaches 70 per cent of the outstanding equity market capitalisation. They can no longer plausibly fool themselves that they are in a position, as a group, to sell out of the corporate sector when it hits hard times. Yet the change in climate also reflects the unprecedented size of the corporate sector financial deficit in the present recession. Institutional lever- age is minimal except in spe- cial circupstances which call either for the provision of fresh capital or the exercise of votes in, for example, bids and deals. The spate of rights issues that is now being applied in reduc- ing the level of outstanding debt in overstretched balance sheets has thrown up an unex- pectedly wide area for the exer- cise of institutional influence. Yet in purely numerical terms a majority of recent boardroom exits does not appear to be the result of direct institutional involvement. The departures of George Davies from Next, Tony Berry from Blue Arrow, Sir Ralph Halpern from Burton Group, John Swanson from Barratt Develop- ments and Michael Henderson from Cookson all to a greater or lesser degree reflected a loss of confidence in their leader- ship on the part of senior exec- utives and non-executive direc- tors, whose numbers have increased in recent years partly as a result of outside pressure. In some cases, such as Sir Timothy Bevan's move from the chairmanship of BET to a mere non-executive director or Sir Derrick Holden-Brown's departure from Allied-Lyons there was a powerful element of doing the decent thing. The size of Allied's unexpected for- eign exchange losses, at Â£147m, certainly called for the busi- ness equivalent of falling on one's sword. But it would be surprising if one of the more powerful influ ences at work here *ere not the threat of takeover. For there has been an even more spectacular change afoot in the market for corporate control than in the world of the insti- tutions. Between 1972 and 1982 the value of acquisitions and mergers in the UK was broadly static in nominal pounds, declining from Â£2.5bn to 22bn. Yet from 1988 to 1MS5 the value sdared from Â£8ban to 227.3bn in a wholly unprece dented boom. Many of th~oe bidse were aaressive; and the cash ele- meent of the takeover consider- ation, which was financed sub stantially by the banking system, went from 44 per cent to 82 per cent over the same period. In an espy money cli- mate predators eNjoyed a field da'y. The shock to British boardrooms was overwhelm- today a mini-takeover boom is once again under way, with predatory bids already announced for Racal Electron- ics and Hawker Siddeley. Even ICI, Britain's biggest manufac- turing company, is under threat from the acquisitive Hanson. So the likelihood Is that a large number of board- goom coups, probably a major- ity, constitute a pre-emptive response to a range of pres- sures, of which a hostile take- over is usually a more pressing concern than institutional intervention. To the extent that this increased capital market disci- pline forces companies to act more quickly to address funda- mental problems, it is wel- come. There was a time when a hostile takeover was virtually the only way in which unwel- come change could be imposed on a sleepy board and in too many cases - British Leyland, Dunlop, Distillers, Chloride - it either came too late or not at all.

   "text_content" : "From Mr Neil Ostrom. Sir, Mr T Turner (Letters, September 17) said that private shareholders are at a disadvan- tage compared with the institu- tions in regard to information about rights issues. This may be simplistic, as it ignores the role the institutions play in promoting success of rights issues. Moreover, their involve- ment also provides sharehold- ers with several options. They can subscribe at the quoted price, wait for a later buying opportunity, do nothing, or sell their shares. However, mention of direc- tors' transactions in the Week- end FT does not always benefit shareholders, as two recent examples indicate. When two directors of ACT sold 1.45m shares at 117p, the price dropped to 108p, only to rise quickly thereafter to 146p. On telephoning the company, I was given a reasonable expla- nation for the sales, but I won- der how many shareholders were persuaded to sell prema- turely. A similar instance arose when controlling shareholders disposed of part of their hold- ing in Betterware at 300p. Fol- lowing the subsequent bonus issue, however, the shares soon rose to an equivalent level of 392p. One recent director's sale, noted on September 13 but not yet made public, was the sale of 1.25m shares by the chair- man of MTM. In this case the share price had begun to slip, despite the announcement of doubled profits, from 265p on September 2 to its present 241p. Someone seems to have had advance access to information not generally available. It seems to me that if the stock exchange wants to see a widening of share ownership then something should to be done to ensure that informa- tion is timely, accurate and freely available.

   "text_content" : "By David Barchard and Richard Lapper NATIONAL WESTMINSTER, the second largest UK banking group, yesterday confirmed that it is to enter the life assur- ance business. It will set up a new subsid- iary, National Westminster Life Assurance, in a joint ven- ture with Clerical Medical, the Bristol-based mutual insurer, to sell insurance and pensions products to the bank's 6.5m customers. The new company will have capital of Â£150m, of which Nat- West will own 92.5 per cent. NatWest is the second major UK bank to enter the life assur- ance market within the space of three days. On Wednesday Abbey National announced that it is to acquire Scottish Mutual Assurance, NatWest will pontinue to operate as an independent financial adviser through its NatWest Insurance Services subsidiary, but the bulk of its effort is likely to focus on direct sales by NatWest Life. Last year NatWest sold 150,000 life policies generating about Â£45m of commission income. The bank's branches will now effectively become \"tied agents\" of the new subsidiary. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of NatWest UK Financial Services, said the new subsidiary would start selling policies in the second half of 1992 and is aiming for a target of 300,000 policies by 1993, generating Â£300m in pre- mium income. NatWest will build a salaried sales force of 3,000 people - many of whom it hopes to recruit from within the ranks of its existing bank employees. A further 1,000 new back office jobs will be created at the insurance company's head- quarters in Bristol over the next five years. NatWest, was the only one of the Big Four clearing banks committed to independent financial advice after the intro- duction of the provisions of the Financial Services Act in 1988. Bradford & Bingley and Yorkshire Building Society, the two remaining large institu- tions which have not yet become tiod agents for insur- ance sales, both expressed dis- appointment at the shrinking of the Independent financial advice market. Clerical Medical, the sixth largest mutual life assurance company and the 15th largest UK life company, will supply fund management and systems services to the joint venture. The company will continue to sell, through independent financial advisers, a full range of life insurance products, including a number not sold by NatWest Life such as group pensions.

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor SCOTTISH CITIES Investment Trust yesterday turned the tables by launching an Â£18m bid for Anglo Scandinavian Investment Trust, just three months after the failure of an Anglo Scandinavian offer for one of Scottish Cities' sister trusts. SCIT has already acquired a 10 per cent stake in Anglo Scandinavian (ASIT) and has received irrevocable acceptances in respect of a further 14.99 per cent. ASIT made a holding statement yesterday, advising shareholders to take no action. Anglo Scandinavian launched a Â£8m bid earlier this year for Lancashire & London Investment Trust, a smaller companies specialist which, like SCIT, is managed by Finsbury Asset Management. Finsbury, with its associated trusts, is part of a complex network of companies built up by Sir Walter Salomon, founder of the Rea Brothers merchant bank. A third Finsbury managed trust, Scottish and Mer- cantile, holds stakes in both SCIT and Lancashire & London. Anglo Scandinavian, which invests solely in other investment trusts, owns stakes in all three trusts managed by Fins- bury and the holdings now represent 55 per cent of its net assets. After the failure of its bid for Lancashire & London, it was left with a 40 per cent stake. Mr Michael Reeve, SCIT's chairman, said: \"ASIT shareholders have not seen any capital appreciation since its flotation and its discount to net asset value is wider than the sector average. Scottish Cities' offer for ASIT provides shareholders with a realistic solution to the dilemma.\" If the bid goes through, SCIT will cancel ASIT's shareholding in itself and place the remainder of its portfolio with outside investors. SCIT will also then simplify its own voting structure, enfranchising its non-voting \"A\" shares and disenfranchis- ing its preference shares. The offer, as is usually the case with investment trust bids, is based on the for- mula asset value (SAV) of ASIT. This is about 4p per share less than its net asset value, currently 102p per share. SCIT is offering 90.25 per cent of the SAV of ASIT in shares, or 82 per cent in cash. That makes the paper offer worth about 88p per share, and the cash offer 80p. SCIT is also offering to buy ASIT warrants for 10p in cash. The SCIT voting shares jumped 27p to 870p yesterday with the non-voting shares gaining 45p to 820p. ASIT shares were unchanged at 86p.",

   "text_content" : "By Jane Fuller BTR, the industrial conglomerate bidding nearly Â£1.5bn for Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, has attacked \"a decade of disap- pointment\" at its target. The offer document, released yesterday, weighs in with graphs showing that Hawker's turnover, trading profit and earnings per share have fallen in real terms since 1981. It contrasts the stagnant fig- ures with its own growth and trading margins, which have averaged 14 per cent over the period compared with Hawk- er's 8.1 per cent. Hawker said the bid was inadequate and its future did not lie with BTR, \"a sprawling conglomerate\".",

   "text_content" : "By Raymond Snoddy CENTRAL Independent Television is to intensify its campaign for more even- handed rules on takeovers of television companies across the European Community. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive,yesterday attacked the disparity in pres- ent regulations which will allow EC television companies to takeover ITV companies from 1994 while national regu- lations prevent British televi- sion companies mounting take- overs in most EC countries. \"We believe this anomaly should be rectified and will continue to draw the situation to the attention of the British and European Parliaments,\" Mr Hill said. He was speaking as the sec- t ond largest ITV company 3 announced a 50 per cent drop * in pre-tax profits to Â£3.4m in f the six months to June 30. i Turnover fell by 9 per cent to Â£139.7m with advertising reve- i nue down at Â£102.2m (Â£113.4m). r Earnings per share were 7.9p * (15.9p) but the interim dividend I has been held at 7.5p. s He also complained about i the punitive effect of the spe- cial Exchequer levy on ITV profits. The levy together with taxation accounted for 80 per cent of Central's profits before r levy. I Analysts are forecasting I Â£16m-Â£17m for the full year. I Despite the poor half, Cen- tral's longer-term position, rel- ative to the rest of the commer- - cial television industry, is very strong. The company guessed correctly that it would be unopposed in the competitive tenders for new franchises and bid only Â£2,000 a year. It is for that reason that Mr Hill wants to even up the take- over rules. Central is aware it could be a takeover target. But the company would also like to be free to be able to own up to 25 per cent of the ITV market in the UK and use the enlarged base to expand into Europe. Central is disappointed how- ever that Home Office minis- ters do not appear to be treat- ing the issue seriously. The Home Office recently said it had decided the position in Europe should be investigated and further action taken through the EC if necessary.",

   "text_content" : "TAKABE, the nursing home group, is seeking to raise M60.2m by Issuing shares and debenture stock to fund its ambitious building pro- gramme, writes Jane Fuller. The share placing and open offer, on a 2-for-5 basis at 140p a share, will raise Â£34.7m, increasing the number of shares in issue from 68m to 88m. This takes the total Tak- are has raised in equity Issues to Â£74.7m since it gained a full listing in April 1989. Another Â£25.5m will come from debenture stock, adding to the Â£15.75m raised in May and making a total of Â£50m, yielding 11.8 per cent. Takare forecast full-year profits 70 per cent higher at Â£7.5m, having announced interim pre-tax profits of Â£3m on turnover of Â£12.4m, Mr Hamilton Anstead, finance director, said that before yesterday's fund-rais- ing, the group had a Â£3m over- draft. Afterwards it would have Â£56m cash, which would fall to between Â£30m and Â£35m by the end of the year, giving net debt of about Â£15m and gearing of 18 per cent. A further 18.4m shares have been placed with institutions as Singer & Friedlander, the merchant banking and prop- erty group, decided to dispose of its 29.1 per cent stake. The gross proceeds at 140p a share were almost Â£26m, compared with a book value of Â£20.5m. S&S said the funds would be used to repay loan stock. De Zoete & Bevan is han- dling the share placements. Takare's share price gained 2p yesterday to close at 151p.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent MR ROY Kettle, who turned Evered Bardon from a Mid- lands-based engineering group into one of the UK's biggest aggregates producers, yester- day resigned as one of the company's most senior executives. News of Mr Kettle's resigna- tion accompanied the com- pany's announcement that pre- tax profits had fallen by 49.5 per cent to Â£10.3m in the six months to the end of June. Net interest payable jumped to Â£9m (Â£3.3m). The company - which also has US aggregates interests - maintained its interim divi- dend at 1.935p. This was only just covered by earnings of 2p (5.7p) per share. Mr Kettle was chief execu- tive of Evered until the com- pany acquired rival quarry group Bardon in an agreed Â£87m share offer at the begin- ning of this year. He became executive vice-chairman fol- lowing the merger and will now become non-executive deputy chairman. Mr Peter Tom, formerly chairman and chief executive of Bardon, will remain chief executive of the merged group. He said that Mr Kettle's deci- sion to stand down at this stage had occurred only slightly earlier than had been planned and had been mutu- ally agreed with the board. Mr Kettle, 67 and a former joint managing director of Tar- mac, the UK's biggest building materials and construction group, had been the driving force behind a series of acquisi- tions made by Evered. These took the group into the top six British aggregates producers. In the process Evered's net debt has risen to Â£300m - equivalent to three-quarters of shareholders' funds of just under Â£400m. Mr Tom said yesterday that the group would not be making any further acquisitions, other than very small purchases. Its priority was to reduce gearing to about 40 per cent. This would be achieved over the next 18 months by selling peripheral and under-perform- ing businesses and making fur- ther cost savings. The group had reduced its US labour force by 20 per cent and its UK workforce by 11 per cent during the 12 months to the end of August. * COMMENT UK profits, after allowing for the effects of the merger, fell by about 31 per cent in the first half. In the US, the decline was about 45 per cent. The ending of moratoria on infrastructure spending in Maryland and Mas- sachusetts will help a bit but not until next year. Little improvement is expected in the UK. Businesses for sale may include clay floor tiles, natural stone and concrete block com- panies in the UK. In the US the Indiana and North Carolina businesses look vulnerable. Proceeds from disposals, how- ever, will take time to come through if fire sales are to be avoided. Pre-tax profits this year may be about Â£28m. Man- agement is going in the right direction but a long haul lies ahead. Not a buy at this stage.",

   "text_content" : "By Michael Skapinker FERRANTI International, the defence and electronics group, is highly unlikely to be profit- able this year, Mr Eugene Anderson, the chairman, told the annual meeting. Mr Anderson said yesterday that shareholders should not expect litigation against those responsible for the fraud at ISC, Ferranti's US subsidiary, to yield much in the way of compensation. Last month Ferranti reached a Â£40m settlement with Peat Marwick, the accountant, over its auditing of ISC's books. Mr Anderson indicated that this payment, made without admis- sion of liability, was likely to be the last substantial compen- sation that Ferranti received. He said the company was attempting to enforce judg- ments against Mr James Guerin, Ferranti's former dep- uty chairman, and his associ- ates. But he added: \"There's very little chance of getting any significant money from the alleged fraudsters. I'm sad to say there's no bonanza.\" Mr Anderson said Ferranti had won contracts worth Â£127m in the first five months of the current year.",

   "text_content" : "By Vanes Houlder, Property Correspondent LONDON SECURITIES, the property and investment group, plunged to pre-tax losses of Â£37.9m for the year to March 81, against profits of Â£8.27m. The bulk of the losses stemmed from a Â£30.1m excep- tional item, which was com- posed of a Â£7.5m provision against investment property, a Â£9.4m provision against share stakes, a Â£1.5m provision against unquoted investments, a Â£7.2m provision against development land and a Â£4m provision which resulted from a joint venture partner roing into receivership. Trading losses of Â£l.5m resulted from a lack of !sset disposals. The sales of s4ares in Clarke Nickolls & Coombs and Five Oaks and prop es at Streatham and Ayles ury contributed Â£7.4m to the losses, although they pro ded a total cash surplus of .6m and cut borrowings by Â£6m. Gearing is now 200 per cnt. The company said that it ay have breached its baning facilities. However it said its banks had given their supdort and had allowed it to amend and increase its facilitles, where appropriate. Mr David Pearl, chairmn, said that the prime conce was to survive. In the absence of profits from disposals, ftr- ther losses were inevitable. Losses per share were 58.jp (earnings 7.5p). The dilutd net asset value has shrunk from 50p a share to 18p.",

This is a special form of debt security. In normal circum- stances it ranks ahead of the banks' preference shares and it guarahfees the bondholders a voice in any new restructuring plans. To avoid receivership, Brent Walker needs to secure the agreement of its bondholders to a refinancing plan. Bondholders have been insisting that they swap their bonds for some form of debt instrument, so that they would have influence in the event that the company needed to be refinanced-again in the future. However, to appease the banks in the event of an insol- vency, the debt instrument reverts to having no preference over the banks' preference shares. This is significant because in mid-Junie, Brent Walker's steering committee of leading banks agreed to a proposal that the bondholders should be offered a debt instrument, only to have It blocked by a group of banks which was led by Bar- clays. These banks had opposed any offer of debt, because they believed it would set an unfor- tunate precedent. The banks are converting part of their loans to Brent Walker into equity. There is a convention in the UK that if banks are forced to convert part of their debt into equity, then other creditors should not be offered debt that ranks ahead of the banks. The latest proposals, described by one banker as a \"hybrid option\" are understood to be acceptable to all the 47 banks with loans outstanding to the group. But Mr Smurfit, who is key to getting agreement to any new refinancing, will still find it difficult to agree to the last clause in the proposals which puts the bondholders at the bottom of the queue in the event of a liquidation. Mr Scoble warned that the company was not prepared to allow the current negotiations with the bondholders to con- tinue much beyond next week. Lonrho is still pushing its own proposals to take over Brent Walker, although they have been rejected by the banks. Mr Rowland has written to the chairmen or chief executives of all 47 banks outlining his offer for the group. Brent Walker's board made no attempt at yesterday's annual general meeting to remove from the board Mrs Jean Walker or her husband, George, the former chairman and founder of the group. A proposal to have them removed as directors at an extraordi- nary general meeting was defeated.",

   "text_content" : "THE ADVERTISING downturn dealt a blow to More O'Ferrall, the outdoor poster contractor, which saw pre-tax profits more than halved to Â£812,000 from a previous Â£1.98m in the first half, Fierce competition with other media in a depressed market meant that margins were squeezed, making for lower profits despite a margin- ally higher group turnover of Â£27.89m (Â£27.65m) in the six months to June 30. The group's interest charge climbed up to Â£1.65m (Â£1.41m). The dividend is held at 3.2p on earnings down to 2.1p (5.2p). Microvitec loss Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer peripherals manufac- turer, lost Â£2.21m before tax in the first six months of 1991, a performance marginally worse than the comparative Â£2.14m. The latest result was struck after exceptional charges of Â£267,000. Sales rose 11 per cent to Â£12.5m (Â£11.2m) but included a contribution of Â£2.49m from Logitek, the computing ser- vices company acquired in May. The interim dividend is passed (0.1p). BLP omits dividend BLP Group, the USM-quoted maker of wood laminates and mouldings, has fallen from profits of Â£468,000 to losses of Â£261,000 pre-tax in the six months to June 30. The interim dividend is being passed (0.25p). Group turnover shrank to Â£28m (Â£30.3m) and losses per share emerged at 5.3p (earn- ings 3p). There was an extraor- dinary loss of Â£485,000 (gain Â£253,000). Bullers losses cut Bullers, maker of consumer products in fine arts, made inroads into its losses in the first half of 1991, reducing them to Â£1.22m. Last time the deficit was Â£2.33m which grew to Â£4.77m by the year-end. The halftime loss was struck after exceptional charges of Â£220,000 (Â£1.14m). Losses per share were 3.18p (7.43p). Ben Bailey tumbles Ben Bailey Construction, the Yorkshire housebuilder, saw its pre-tax profit crash from Â£1.81m to Â£317,000 in the year ended June 30 1991. Earnings per share fell to 2.16p (11.47p) and the final divi- dend is only 0.5p for a total of 0.8p, against 1.9p. Trace Computers Trace Computers, the com- puter services company, reported pre-tax losses of Â£471,000 (Â£1.81m profits) in the year to May 31. The company blamed its newer acquisitions, with the financial software division in particular incurring a substan- tial loss. Net interest costs rose to Â£515,000 (Â£176,000). Turnover was Â£19.7m (Â£13.9m) including the first full contribution from a number of purchases. Losses per share were 2.04p (earnings 10.49p) and an unchanged final dividend of 0.9p is proposed for a main- tained total 1.45p with a scrip option. Tuskar Resources Tuskar Resources, the Dublin- based oil exploration group, has reduced its losses from IE10m to IÂ£8.26m, or Â£7.57m sterling, in the year to March 31. No dividend is being paid. The USM-quoted company said the principal element of the losses was a write-off of exploration expenditure, mainly in Turkey, totalling IE7.77m. Losses per share were cut to 4.06p (6.11p). Aran Energy in red Aran Energy, the Dublin-based oil and gas exploration and production group, slipped into the red in the first half of 1991 recording a pre-tax loss of I38,000 (Â£35,000) for the period, against a Â£171,000 profit last time. Turnover rose from IE13.8m to IÂ£14.5m. Losses per share came out at 0.08p (0.12p earn- ings). Wiggins progress A substantial reduction in losses was achieved by Wig- gins Group, the property devel- oper and housebuilder, in the year ended March 31 1991, helped by lower write-offs and interest charges. The loss before tax came to Â£2.54m, against Â£13.54m, after provisions to reduce develop- ments to net realisable value Â£914,000 (Â£9.17m) and interest Â£1.75m (Â£4.88m). Operating profit fell to Â£122,000 (Â£510,000). Losses per share were 15.7p (76p). Housebuilding profit fell from Â£2.32m to Â£280,000 on turnover of Â£10.7m (Â£21.1m). Property development provided a profit of Â£505,000, against a loss of Â£874,000. Pathfinders falls Pathfinders Group, the USM-quoted media and enter- tainment recruitment agency, fell to break-even in the year to March 31, and after exceptional charges of Â£221,000 moved into a loss of Â£218,000 pre-tax. The loss compared with a profit of Â£121,000 in 1989-90; it came on turnover down to Â£769,000 (Â£1.63m). Losses per share were 0.76p (earnings 0.33p). The exceptional charges mainly represented expenses and compensation payments to former directors. Burns-Anderson The Burns-Anderson Group, the recruitment and financial services group, incurred losses of Â£27,000 pre-tax in the six months to June 30 1991. Previ- ously, in the nine months to June 30 1990, the group made restated pre-tax profits of Â£1.59m. The interim dividend is again passed. In the period under review, turnover was Â£35.4m, operating profits Â£936,000 and earnings per share 0.09p. In the corre- sponding nine-month period they had been Â£55.5m, Â£2.79m and 2.62p respectively. How Group lower How Group, the building ser- vices contractor, is cutting its interim dividend from 1.35p to Ip as pre-tax profits for the first half of 1991 fell from Â£1.49m to Â£507,000. Earnings per share came to 0.51p (2.21p). Turnover rose to Â£123m (Â£113m). Armour Trust Pre-tax profits of Armour Trust fell from Â£2.22m to Â£1.51m in the year ended April 30, as a 30 per cent reduction in trading profits of the automotive sion outweighed record figures from the confectionery side. Mr Andrew Balcombe, chair- man, pointed out that the pre- vious year included Â£200,000 from the sale of property and profits of a subsidiary sold. Turnover slipped to Â£20.4m (Â£21.2m). Earnings were 4.1p (5.6p) per share and the pro- posed final dividend is 1.1175p for a total of 1.4175p (1.35p). Triton Europe Triton Europe, the indepen- dent UK oil and gas explora- tion company, reported a boost in after-tax profits from Â£1.49m to Â£31.39m in the year ended May 1991, but these included exceptional credits of Â£34.85m. The profits are from continu- ing operations. The period was highlighted by the sale of the group's North Sea assets for Â£32.9m resulting in a pre-tax figure of Â£24.2m. Turnover was up slightly at Â£29.7m from Â£29.3m. Wembley declines Wembley, the leisure group which owns the football sta- dium, reported a collapse in taxable profits from Â£4.7m to Â£709,000 in the six months to June. This fall was further marked after property dispos- als of Â£9.8m and exceptional items of Â£994,000, which swelled last year's profits to Â£15.5m. Interest charges jumped from Â£4.86m to Â£7.95m. Borrow- ings of Â£145m, representing 90 per cent of shareholders' funds, have been used to finance the group's capital expenditure programme. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.9p. Earnings per share fell from 4.5p to 0.2p.",

Fully diluted earnings per share is not shown as there is no dilution. TAXATION In the current period the Group did not generate any income assessable to Hong Kong profits tax. The tax charge represents overseas withholding tax on interest and dividend income. EXTRACT FROM THE CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT Confidence in Hong Kong was considerably boosted by the US Government's renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status followed by agreement between the British and Chinese Governments for the construction of the new Hong Kong airport. The economy of Guangdong Province continues to strengthen and expand and your Company is well positioned to take advantage of developments as they occur. Despite these favourable long term trends profits declined this year due to reduced revenues and an increase in management fees associated with the appointment agreed upon at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 3rd July 1990 of a new manager for the unquoted investments. Net asset value per share declined by approximately 4.4%, notwithstanding the buoyant performance of the Hong Kong stock market overall during the period. The principal reasons for this were the costs of further rationalisation of the direct investment portfolio and the relatively narrow base of the listed portfolio which is concentrated in China-related companies, which, as a sector lagged behind the performance of the Hong Kong market overall. DIVIDEND Your Board recommends the payment of a special interim dividend of US$0.01 per share to be paid to the shareholders on the Register of Members as at lth November, 1991 in respect of the current financial year, rather than the payment of a final dividend in respect of the 1991 financial year (1990: US$0.02 per share). Warrant holders who have exercised their warrants will therefore be entitled to receive this dividend. DIRECTORS' INTERESTS IN SHARES ANDIOR WARRANTS At 31st July, 1991 Mr. J.D. Bolsover had a beneficial interest in 4,700 ordinary sham and 940 warrants of the Company. No other director holding office at 31stJuly, 1991 or their associates had any beneficial interest in the Company's ordinary shares and warrants.

   "text_content" : "By JUne Fuller ASTRA HOLDINGS, the British munitions company which is being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry, yesterday announced that it lotmore than Â£llm In the year to March 31. This brings the total losses to Â£77m as a pair of company doctors have tackled the prob- lems created by hasty and costly acquisitions, culminat- ing in the purchase of PRB, a Belgian munitions company, which has since collapsed. Mr Roy Barber, chairman, and Mr Tony McCann, chief executive, are working on the restructuring of the group's Â£44m debt. Annual costs have been cut by about l10m and Mr Barber said the group was more than breaking even at the operating level. Mr Barber said yesterday that Astra was on its knees before the PRB acquisition. The UK company has never included PRB's results in its profit and loss account and last year made an Â£18m write-off to cover the lost investment. DTI attention has focused on events leading up to the acqui- sition. In July 1989, Astra made a Â£86m rights issue, rather more than ft needed to fund the PRB purchase. It has since emerged that It had breached covenants on a Â£50m syndi- cated loaf early in the year, if not before. Mr McCann said yesterday that most of Astra's debt dated back to the purchase of BMARC, a UK company, in 1988. It cost Â£60m, twice the amount raised in an associated rights issue. Altogether between 1987 and 1989, Astra raised about Â£90m from shareholders in addition to the Â£50m loan, raised at about the time of the BMARC purchase. Asked where the money had gone, Mr Barber pointed to the Â£77m of losses in the past two years' accounts, which have amounted to a deck-clearing exercise. In 1990-91, Astra cut its oper- ating loss to Â£2.2m (Â£6.6m) on sales of Â£86.8m (Â£90.2m). Inter- est payments of Â£7m contrib- uted to a pre-tax loss of Â£11.2m (Â£23.8m). Losses per share were 11.4p (31.lp) and shareholders' funds fell to Â£10.8m (Â£22.2m).",

   "text_content" : "PROPERTY development provided a major slice of the profits at Adwest Group, the manufacturer of automotive components and power systems, in a year that saw the taxable figure fall 43 per cent, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. In the face of a severe down- turn in its core defence and automobile markets, pre-tax profits in the year to June 30 tumbled from Â£12.5m to Â£7.1m. Mr Fred Grant, chairman, said that \"quite unprecedented things took place\" during a very difficult period. In the first two months, which were two of the strongest in normal times, the group made no profit at all. The automotive division, which makes power steering wheels primarily for Land Rover and Jaguar, was plagued by lower production by its main customers. The French market, where it served Peugeot and Renault, also took a severe plunge when the Gulf War started. Adwest had been shrinking its defence business after the division was merged with the electrical side into a new Power Systems division. New business in defence was difficult to come by while com- mercial applications were not easy to find either, Mr Menzies said. Last year it made no prof- its from its defence activities, compared to profits of about Â£3.5m in the division's heyday. The property division con- tributed Â£2.5m (Â£2.9m) to trad- ing profits from the sale of land and investment proper- ties. Earnings per share were cut to 8.2p (14.1p) but the finaldivi- dend is held at 5.75p making an unchanged 7p. \"We've squeezed the sponge pretty hard,\" said Mr Grant."

   "text_content" : "By Halig Simonian in Milan OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equip- ment group, yesterday unveiled a L73.7bn ($58.5m) pre-tax loss for the first half of this year, compared with a L60.9bn profit in the same period in 1990. The group blamed its perfor- mance on the severe price com- petition facing computer mak- ers and the worldwide slowdown in demand. Its sales declined by 5.4 per cent to L3,943bn from L4,167bn in the first six months of last year. \"Computer companies reacted to this scenario by announcing major restructur- ings and engaging in price wars that in some cases involved discounts of up to 40 per cent,\" the company said. It stressed its financial health, noting that net indebt- edness had risen by only IA49bn to L793.5bn in the first half of this year. Although Olivetti gave no forecast for 1991 as a whole, it implied it saw little respite. The prospect of continuing De Benedetti: stressed the group's finandal health weak market conditions meant it would have to take further unspecified measures to \"improve competitiveness in terms of costs and performance in terms of revenues and prof- itability\". The company sought to put its difficulties in the context of the international computer industry, where there have been widespread falls in profit- ability and the Italian econ- omy's own structural prob- lems. \"At the end of the 1970s, 0li- vetti was the first Italian com- I pany to return to reporting sig- niFLcant profits. Today, it is among the first to announce negative results. This is a sign of the loss of competitiveness of Italy's industrial system,\" said Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman. Earlier this year, Mr De Benedetti warned that Oli- vetti's response to the strong lira and annual cost rises of around 10 per cent might be to transfer more production abroad, particularly to the Far East. The company gave no indica- tion yesterday of whether a decision had yet been taken. However, it said it had con- tained expenses by more than 2 per cent in the first half of this ear, despite Italy's relatively high inflation rate. Yet again it threw down the gauntlet to Italy's politicians, complaining that, in the absence of the special legisla- tion needed to carry out the 8,000 early retirements it is planning this year, cost con- tainment was not enough to compensate for declining reve- nues.",

   "text_content" : "By Halg Simonlan MONTEDISON, the Italian chemicals company controlled by the Ferruzzi group, saw net profits drop to L201bn ($166.9m) in the first half of this year, from L338bn in the same period in 1990. The company blamed declining demand for plastics, which was only partly compensated for by more favourable market conditions for other segments, such as agro-industrial goods and energy. Sales rose to L7,562bn from L7,384bn. It added that rationalisation was under way in several 1 areas, notably the Montecatini 1 chemicals subsidiary. t Mr Giuseppe Garofano, i managing director of Ferruzzi f Finanziaria, which controls Montedison, put a brave face on the results. I Mr Garofano put the earnings in the context of the Montedison-Ferruzzi group as a whole, where falling profits in i some sectors' activities, such i as chemicals, have been I matched by increases in other i areas. Group debt at Montedison i fell by L2,027bn to L6,615bn in [ the first half of the year, compared with the same period in the previous year. However, the figure was L800bn higher than at end-December 1990. * ERIDANIA, the Italian sugar producer controlled by the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, lifted pre-tax profits by 12.3 per cent to L210bn in the first half of this year, from L187bn in the same period last year. It expects year-end profits to reflect the same rate of growth as in the first six months. In 1990, Eridania made net profits of L230bn. First-half sales rose by 1.5 per cent to L4,748bn from L4A688bn in 1990. The company said all sectors had performed well, with appreciable improvements in edible and industrial oils in particular. Eridania also announced the acquisition by its Cerestar subsidiary of Biacor, an Italian group specialising in citric acid and derivates, with annual sales of almost L50bn. A price was not disclosed. Biacor is the only producer of citric acids in Italy and has a European market share of around 10 per cent, Eridania claimed.",

The state-owned carrier announced an operating loss of L90.6bn, while revenue fell to L2,080bn from last year's L2,100bn. Alitalia said in a statement that it expected to break even in the second half. The airline said that the Gulf war had cost the group about L250bn in lost revenue.

   "text_content" : "By Peter Bruce in Madrid THE appetite of Endesa, the I Spanish state-controlled elec- tricity generator, for swallow- i ing private sector competitors, developed further yesterday when it announced it was mak- i ing an agreed bid for 25.01 per i cent of Fecsa, the biggest Cata- i lan utility. 1 The deal, which will cost i Endesa $400m, will raise its 4 stake in Fecsa to 40 per cent and give it control of the com- I pany's management. The offer will be made at i Pta758 a share. Endesa has already spent $900m this year i buying more than 80 per cent i of the main Cantabrian utility, I Viesgo and in taking its stake i in the Andalucian generator 4 and distributor, Sevillana, to I 33.5 per cent. I Endesa, majority-owned by the state and whose shares i trade in Madrid and New York, I has been the government's chief weapon in its efforts to reform the electricity sector in Spain. Made up largely of private utilities, the sector is being corralled into two large groups which the authorities hope will be better able to finance invest- ments in new generating capacity. All the utilities are highly geared and Fecsa had to be res- cued from bankruptcy in the mid-eighties. The two biggest private sec- tor utilities, Hidrola and Iber- duero, merged last spring to form Iberdrola. The govern- ment is determined that End- esa should lead the second large group but has had a prob- lem because Endesa is a whole- sale supplier to the private utilities and has no distribu- tion of its own. The acquisitions of Viesgo, Sevillana and now Fecsa, are designed to increase distribu- tion income. Perhaps more importantly, Endesa also needs to have util- ities as captive clients, should the European Community ever decide to liberalise the Euro- pean electricity sector. Pres- ently, Endesa enjoys a privi- leged status as the government forces the private utilities to buy its electricity. It is likely that after the takeover is completed, Fecsa will merge with Endesa's Cata- lan affiliate, Enher, which has about 32 per cent of the regional market, further increasing the state group's control of power supply in Spain's most industrialised region. Fecsa has about 54 per cent of the big Catalan market.",

   "text_content" : "By Hugh Carnegy in Tel Aviv KOOR Industries, the big Israeli Industrial group crip- ledfor the past three years debts of $1.2bn, finally com- pleted a restructuring agree- ment with its creditors yester- day, involving a $240m bank write-off and a big shift in con- trol from its trade union own- ers to the banks. The deal reduced overall debt to $750m and restored equity capital from a negative $70m to a positive $150m. It capped a period during which Israel's biggest industrial group came close to liquida- tion. A turnround programme which cut the labour force from 32,000 to less than 20,000 eventually restored profitabil- ity and persuaded the credi- tors to keep the company afloat. \"The heavy shadow of uncer- tainty about the company's prospects has been removed,\" said a relieved Mr Benjamin Gaon, chief executive since early 1989. \"We will now move forward to run our business in an eco- nomically viable manner to produce good returns for our owners.\" The most striking effect of yesterday's deal is the accep- tance by the Histadrut, the powerful trade union federa- tion, of a drastic reduction in its shareholding, exercised through its industrial owner- ship arm Hevrat Ha'ovdim. Koor, which in its heyday accounted for 10 per cent of Israeli industrial capacity, was the pillar of the Histadrut's unusual role as both employer and trade union. Hevrat will invest $25m in Koor, but its shareholding will sink to less than 26 per cent from near total control under options for a 41 per cent hold- ing granted to the Israeli bank creditors. The local banks also agreed to write off about $200m of their $600m Koor dues. They will loan a further $130m to Koor, $100m guaranteed by the Israeli government which will also put in a $50m equity injection. The foreign bank creditors, led by Manufacturers Hanover, agreed to write off $40m of the $200m owed to them by Koor. They receive $85m in cash and a 7.5 per cent shareholding. The balance of about $40m will be repaid over the next 4'/ years at a charge of 1 per cent over the London interbank offered rate. Foreign and Israeli bond holders, who together accounted for more than $200m of Koor debt, agreed to a mixed cash, shares and new notes arrangement which will leave both groups with share- holdings of around 6 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "By Andrew Hill in Brussels CONSOLIDATED profits at Solvay slumped by 15 per cent in the first half of the year and the Belgian chemicals group yesterday warned its 1991 prof- its would not match last year's figure of BFrl5.9bn ($460m). In the first six months of the year consolidated earnings dropped from BFr8.03bn to BFr6.8bn, a figure which includes an extraordinary gain of BFr750m in unused tax pro- visions. Sales rose by just 3.5 per cent in the same period to BFrl37bn, compared with BFrl32bn. \"The current trend of the economy does not give a hint - as might have been hoped - of an improvement in profit margins for the next few months,\" the group said in a statement. Solvay's plastics activities - its second largest sector by turnover after the core alkalis business - were badly hit at the beginning of the year by the Gulf war, which pushed up the price of the basic raw mate- rials. More seriously, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) selling prices were eroded by strong competi- tion from manufacturers in eastern and central Europe and in the US. The group explained yester- day that although there was no overcapacity in PVC in Europe, former state-owned central and eastern European producers, suffering from the rapid down- turn in their domestic econo- mies, had started to sell into new markets at unrealistically low prices. Alkalis were also affected by the economic slowdown, but the group said the overall result from alkalis and perox- ides had proved more resistant to the recession. A Solvay spokesman said yesterday: \"I hope we've reached the bottom for consoli- dated earnings, but basically in 1992 [the result] will mainly depend on the general eco- nomic situation.\" Solvay said sales and profits in the smaller health sector, which accounted for about 18 per cent of group turnover last year, had \"advanced mark- edly\" during the first half Vet- erinary products and the human health operations were particularly strong performers. On Wednesday, a symbolic meeting of the Solvay board was held in the group's Bern- burg soda-ash plant in eastern Germany, which has Just been returned to the company after 52 years under Nazi and then communist control. Baron Daniel Janssen, the group's chairman, said the sac- tory - once the largest Solvay plant in the world - would break even for the four months to the end of 1991. It is to be converted from light to dense soda-ash production and might start contributing profits to the group next year.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Friedman in New York HILL & KNOWLTON, the second biggest public relations firm in the US, and owned by WPP of the UK, was yesterday in the unenviable position of having its own, rather large, public relations problem. The problem is Mr Robert Dilenschneider, aged 47, the Hill & Knowlton chief execu- tive, who yesterday contra- dicted Hill & Knowlton's press announcement that he had resigned. \"Legally, I can only say that I did not resign. I have left,\" he said. Although Mr Dilenschneider helped Hill & Knowlton's reve- nues to more than double to $196m last year, from $77m in 1985, his abrasive management style, approval of controversial clients and publication of a self-promoting book which offended Hill & Knowlton cli- ents, all conspired to create, what one Hill & Knowlton insider yesterday described as \"a very cruel atmosphere inside the firm, a virtual revolt by many of our executives\". No single factor seems to have caused Mr Dilenschnei- der's abrupt departure. How- ever, the firm's client list included several curious choices that contributed to internal and external polemics. The most contentious client was the Church of Scientology, whose financial dealings and alleged brainwashing tech- niques have come under public scrutiny in the US. Hill & Knowlton acknow- ledged yesterday that Smith Kline Beecham, the UK drugs company, withdrew some of its Hill & Knowlton business because of the Scientology account. Another controversial account was the Bank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI). Hill & Knowlton said yesterday that it had repre- sented BCCI as well as Mr Clark Clifford, the former chairman of First American Bankshares of Washington, who is under investigation in the US over his denial that he knew of BCCI's secret control of the US bank. Mr Dilenschneider is believed to be contemplating legal action against his old firm. Speculation is rife that he is said to be planning to set up his own agency. Mr Martin Sorrell, the WPP chief executive who is said to have clashed with Mr Dilen- schneider, yesterday declined to comment, except to confirm that BCCI was among Hill & Knowlton's past accounts.",

   "text_content" : "By Nikki Tait in New York USAIR, one of the financially troubled, medium-sized US air- lines, yesterday warned it expects to make a loss of more than $500m pre-tax in 1991. And, in a formal statement, Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chief executive, was almost equally gloomy about 1992. \"Assuming a continuation of the present industry environ- ment and its negative impact on airline traffic and revenue, the outlook for 1992 may not be much better\" than that for the current 12 months, he said. In moves to combat its mounting problems, USAir said it would \"call on employ- ees to participate in cost reduc- tion programmes for the long-term viability\" of the car- rier - although it declined to give any details of these mea- sures until they have been dis- cussed with employees in mid- October. At the same time, the airline - which ranks sixth in the US airline industry and is heavily oriented to the east coast and mid-west regions - also announced significant changes in its fleet acquisition plans. These include a sale-and-lease- back deal with GE Capital, the finance arm of General Elec- tric, involving 15 Boeing 737-300, which will raise $330m. Red ink and profit warnings have been flowing from USAir for some time. After making a $501m operating loss in 1990 and incurring a $189m deficit in the first six months of 1991, USAir said in July that it expected to show little, if any, improvement over the 1990 operating figures. USAir's shares have fallen sharply from a 1991 high of $24 % to their current $10%.",

   "text_content" : "THE DOLLAR eged lower yesterday in slow trading after the latest US personal income and cqnsumption figures led to fresh speculation about a reduc ion in American interest rates.' The 0.4 per cent rise in per- sonal income during August was marginally below expecta- tions, while the 0.1 per cent gain in consumption was slightly above most forecasts. Initiplly, the market showed no reaction to the data but as economists examined the fig- ures,.the dollar came under pressure as it became clear that US consumers are using their rising income to pay off debt rather than spend it in the shops. With an investment-led recovery unlikely, hopes for a solid upswing have fallen on the shoulders of the consumer. Their reluctance to react more strongly to the reduction in interest rates has led to fears that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again to pre vent the economy sliding back into recession. Next week, the release of the September employment report is likely to dominate markets and could confine the dollar to a narrow range. Economists at Midland Montagu expect Sep tember non-farm payroll employment to have risen by just 10,000 persons, against the 34,000 increase the previous month. Until New York opened, the US currency remained trapped in a tight range. But after the consumer data a large US bank actively sold dollars in New York. The bank had driven the dollar higher earlier in the week and yesterday's sales were reckoned to be profit-tak- ing. The dollar closed lower at DM1.6770 from DM1.6825; at SFr1.4595 from SFr1.4650; at Y133.50 from Y133.45; and at FFr5.7125 from FFr5.7325. Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the Bank of Spain was reported to have intervened to break the peseta's decline, selling dollars and buying pesetas in Madrid. The previous day there were widespread suggestions that the Bank of Spain had sold D-Marks for peseta's but that had failed to stop the decline. The weakhess in the Spanish currency follows indications earlier in the week from Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, that mone- tary policy may be eased to offset an expected tight 1992 budget. The D-Mark fell back to Pta63.2932 from Pta63.44 in the previous session. Sterling was mixed to weaker after an opinion poll which put the Labour party slightly ahead of the Conserva- tive party. Sterling closed lower at DM2.9125 from DM2.9150; at SFr2.5350 from SFr2.5400; and at FFr9.9250 from FFr9.9350; but was higher at $1.7375 from $1.7330; and at Y231.75 from Y231.50.

   "text_content" : "LONDON money market rates were steady as dealers pre- pared for a busy session on Monday when the end of the current quarter is expected to make for an active day. The key three months inter-bank money closed at 10f-% per cent, up A point. Further support to rates came from the actions of the Bank of England, which left the market short of liquidity. It bought a total of Â£1.64bn bills compared with an estimated forecast shortage of Â£1.85bn. The money markets are not UK larilg efk base lakn rate arI 8p0mber 4, 1691 anticipating any immediate reduction in interest rates - three months money at around 10% per cent suggests little change is expected before the end of the year. In the fuatures market, the latest opinion poll putting the Labour party 3 points ahead of the Conservative party led to some early weakness and reinforced the nervousness about the political prospects far the Conusrvatives. At yesterday's 91-day UK Treasury bill tender, the average raof discount rose to 9.6Vl9 pr cent from 98895 per cent last eek. The difference, or tail, between the average rate and top accepted rate of 9.7267 per cent was 2.88 basis points and the Â£300m auction, which included some 92-day bills, attracted bids of Â£1.031bn to give a bid-cover ratio of 3.44. In Frankfurt the Bundesbank injected short-term funds into a tight money market, but call money stayed higher levels around 9.15-25 per cent from 8.95-9.05 per cent. The Bundesbank had pumped in an estimated DM3-4bn at around 9.15 per cent as call money climbed in early trade. But the injection was too small to drive call money lower and the market is likely to stay tight. Pension payments totalling up to DM14bn will drain funds today and banks also have to pay DM4bn for four-year notes. Funds coming into the market include DMSbn of public sector salary payments and up to DM3bn of zero-coupon notes issued by the state of East Germany last year. In New York the Federal I Reserve added temporary i reserves to the banking system i through $1.5bn of customer repurchase agreements. The Fed's actions had been widely anticipated and Federal funds were trading at 5& per cent when the Fed intervened, slightly higher than the presumed 5% per cent targt.

   "text_content" : "By Terry Byland, UK Stock Market Editor STOCK INDEX futures called the tune in the UK stock mar- ket yesterday, as several lead- ing securities houses struggled to balance commitments ahead of the expiry on Monday morn- ing of the September futures contract on the FT-SE Index, With Monday also marking the end of the third quarter of the year and last night bringing the close of the two week trad- ing account, yesterday's ses- sion brought highly erratic movements in share prices. The final minutes of trading saw the FT-SE Index settle down to close just one point short of the 2,600 mark which has proved such an elusive tar- get over the past month. Although the big London- based securities houses have now reduced their heavy expo- sure in futures built up during Sep16 Sep 3 Oct 14 Sep 2 O ct10 Oct 24 Sep 27 Oct 11 Oct25 Oct 7 00121 Nov 4 li. W4NM doenlg mOy 1* ph\" \"erm aU mWo buuhm OWerN\" the abortive Soviet coup, they were still rushing to tidy posi tions yesterday. At mid-morn- ing, basket trades of blue chip stocks were sold and Septem- ber futures contracts bought. At the low point, the FT-SE Index was down by nearly seven points. As the selling died away, the Footsie rebounded to show a net gain of ten points before reacting sharply again to close with the FT-SE Index finally a net 3.4 up at 2,599.0. Seaq turnover increased to 5686m shares. Over the week, UK equities have shed a trifling 1.8 points on the Footsie scale as the big investment institutions have backed away from equities in the face of poor company reports, which have displayed the effects of the economic recession on profits. The, two week trading account saw a drop of 26.8 Footsie points. Futures-related and similar technical factors tended to swamp deeper considerations yesterday. On the UK political front, the latest opinion polls showed a lead for the Labour opposition party, but further polls will be published this weekend. Excitement was spurred by the announcement that President Bush planned an important announcement on defence strategy but Lon- don took its cue from a calm opening on Wall Street which was just 4.25 ahead in UK hours. .Corporate developments con- tinued to unsettle the market. The institutions are grappling with two large rights issues, Â£432m from British Aerospace and Â£280m from Hillsdown, with share prices in both cases uncomfortably close to the price of the new rights shares. There was a further fall in Asda, the food supermarket group, as a leading institution cut its stake to below declar- able levels; the market still fears a rights issue from Asda. Last night, traders were resigned to facing another diffi- cult trading session on Monday as futures contracts finally expire. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t",

   "text_content" : "The \"on/off big rights issue/ takeover bid\" stories surround- ing Asda, the troubled food retailing group, continued to promote heavy two-way activ- ity in the shares, which dropped to an all time low of 53p at one point yesterday. Suggestions of a Â£300m plus rights issue at 45p a share have been circulating since the group announced disastrous interim figures, a week and a half ago. A counter to these stories have been hints that a bid was being lined up for Asda, although Tengelmann, the German group, vigorously denied any such intention ear- lier this week. The stock price initially came under heavy selling pres- sure yesterday, dipping to the 53p level, but then staging a determined rally to end the session a net 6%'/ off at 55p. Turnover was 11m, bringing the weekly total of shares traded up to 75.6m. During the previous week turnover topped 200m shares. Much of the early weakness was said to have been caused by speculators who had been looking for a bid, baling out of the shares. And there were suggestions that recent heavy support for the shares from one US investment house had run its course. Mowlem wanted Shares in John Mowlem, the construction group, rose sharply, closing 11 higher at 223p, after long-waited news of official permission for the run- way extension to the London City Airport. Mowlem has a 90 per cent stake in the airport. An extension to the runway is seen as essential to stem- ming losses at the airport. It would enable the airport to accommodate the British Aero- space 146 jet aircraft, and increase the range of destina- tions offered to its passengers. At present London City has only been able to accommodate Dash 7 turbo-prop aircraft which have a more limited range. Mowlem shares hit a five- year low of 215p earlier this week but began to rally on Wednesday. Much of the action in oils centred on the lesser known stocks and in particular on Exploration Company of Louisiana, (XCL), where the startling rise in the stock price this week prompted the com- pany to issue a statement yes- terday. This week has seen the shares rocket from the 24p on Monday morning to 58p at one point yesterday before closing at 56p, up 14. It was suggested that the group had secured new exploration acreage in the US, adjacent to a prolific hydrocarbon area, and had also sold some assets. The company said after the close of trading on the stock market that it knew of no rea- son for such an increase in its share price. It said it had made presentations to US institu- tional investors who bought shares on the London market. Some notably heavy trades in XCL shares showed up on the Seaq delayed ticker earlier this week. Activity in Racal Electronics picked up significantly. The shares moved up 3 to 57%p on heavy turnover of 13m, amid hints that a counter bid to the near Â£700m offer launched by Williams Holding two weeks ago is about to materialise. Specialists are looking for an injection of cash into the bid arena. The Williams offer is all- paper, three Williams shares for every 20 Racal. Vodafone rose sharply fol- lowing a strong buy recom- mendation from Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. Mr Richard Ryder and Mr Andrew Harrington at Salo- mon shifted their stance on the stock from hold to buy and NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGH (115). TSH FUNDS (7) Tr. 9pc 1992-96.

British Aerospace ran back to 409p before steadying to close 15 off at 413p, reflecting worries that its Â£432m rights issue may be given the thumbs down by shareholders. Confirmation that Zaire's biggest copper and cobalt mines have been shut since Monday because of rioting came after metal and equity markets had closed. The cop- per price closed officially slightly lower, but rose in after-hours trading. RTZ, which has been strong on the back of a firm copper price, rose again yesterday to 565p, up 8 on the day. Glaxo recovered ground after four consecutive days of weakness. Investors were reminded of the potential of the company's migraine drug Imigran by publicity given to a research study on the drug's effectiveness. The shares gained 18 to 1356p. Scientific press coverage of the apparent failure of research designed to find an Aids vaccine underpinned the Wellcome price. Wellcome makes an Aids treatment that is not a vaccine. The shares added 9 at 750p. Fisons recovered after recent weakness only to lose ground again on talk that its iron sup- plement Inferon might be with- drawn from the French mar- ket. The temporary absence of high margin Inferon from the US this year caused a drop in profits that surprised City ana- lysts. The shares were 8 higher at one point before ending a 2 to the good at 455p. The steady flow of buyers of BO3, following a broker's recommendation earlier in the week, continued unabated. The shortage of stock was exacer bated as a result and the shares were squeezed 20 higher to 613p. Paper maker Arjo Wiggins Appleton added 8 at 275p helped by news that it had won an EC anti-dumping case over facsimile machine paper sup- plies from the Far East. Lasmo, 307p, and Enterprise, 510p,the leading stocks in the exploration and production sub-sector, were restrained by a cautious note from Hoare Govett. The broker put an asset valuation of 493p a share on Enterprise and 335p a share on Lasmo. Allied-Lyons recovered sharply, helped by more bid speculation. Traders said senior management of the favoured predator, Philip Mor- ris, was visiting Europe. They also reported buying for the new account, which starts on Monday. The shares were 17 better at one point before end- ing 14 higher on the day at 639p in good volume. Guinness eased 7 to 1019p following a meeting at a securi- ties house on Thursday. Ratners lost ground rapidly in heavy trade. Two large blocks of shares were dealt and represented two placings of stock with institutions accord- ing to traders. They said one had not gone well and the fail- ure pushed the shares 10 lower to 115p as turnover reached 15m. Sears slipped 2 to 92p ahead of interims on Tuesday. United Newspapers contin- ued to benefit from better than expected figures on Thursday. The shares rose another 15 to 413p for a two-day improve- ment of 39. Paper company David Smith dropped 21 to 348p after a gloomy annual meeting state- ment. The company said it saw no sign of a recovery. Aircraft interiors designer AIM Group gained 16 to 161p after BZW reiterated its buy stance on the company. The effects of an open offer of shares in Takare, the nurs- ing homes group, had already been discounted by the market and the shares rose 2 to 151p. Mr Andrew Richmond of UBS Phillips & Drew moved the stocl from a sell to a hold and said he was restrained from turning buyer because the company was not as cheap on an asset basis as it appeared on earnings. Also, BZW placed Singer & Friedlander's 29 per cent stake (18.4m shares) in Takare at 140p a share with a FI-A A141oUre Index Turnover by vplume (million) Excluding: Intra-madket buslae & Overseas turnover 600 400 200 0 variety of i stitutions. Enamelware manufacturer Bilston & Battersea, also USM- listed, continued to suffer the effects of Thursday's poor first- half resultsj and the shares fell 10 to 50p, a drop of 16 in two days.

Trade of one million or more are rounded down. V-LY~-~I hv- U~uCU-- r~ u~Ln~l ~..~ EQUITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING LIFFE traders were once again busy rolling out their open positions in the September Footsie future contract ahead of the new-style expiry on Monday, writes Peter John. The market has instigated change in response to claims of market manipulation and price rigging following expiry of the June contract last year. The expiry time has been dou- bled from 10 to 20 minutes and will take place slightly earlier in the morning to avoid a pos- sible clash with the release of economic data. Any worries that there will be a large number of open positions on expiry appeared to dissolve yesterday. Brisk business over the past two days has brought the open interest in the September con- tract down to an estimated 10,000, par for the course at this stage. The premium on September, which closed at 2604 yesterday, came down to 5 points above the underlying cash market at the close. How- ever, the spread between Sep- tember and the December con. tract widened to 60 points. Turnover on LTOM was down on previous days with only 24,108 lots dealt. Bid speculation appeared to be the prominent feature among stock options with Asda, Allied-Lyons and Sears the busiest three traders.",

   "text_content" : "HOPES THAT this week's meeting of the International Coffee Council would further the cause of a proposed stock retention scheme to boost flag- ging prices had all but evapo- rated by the time producing and consuming country dele- gates took their seats at the International Coffee Organisa- tion's London headquarters on Monday morning. In the event the plan, to withhold 10 per cent of coffee production from the market, was only presented informally by Brazil and Colombia, who had failed to secure the back- ing of African and Asian pro- ducers. And it got a pretty cold reception from consumers, especially the all-important Americans. The scheme's backers were not ready, however, to accept that it had been rejected. she scheme cannot be rejected because it has not been 5m- cilly proposed,\" explained one delegate. Neither was there any nego. tiation this week on the revival of the ICO's export quota sys- tem, suspended in July 198I. As the talks ground towards their conclsion yestednay dld- egates contented themselves with extending the current international agreement, with- out economic clauses, for an extra year after its scheduled expiry next September and forming a working group to consider the possibility of set- ting up a new agreement. The group is to report its recom- mendations by the start of ApriL The general expectation of such an outcome was reflected in last week's Â£23 fall in the November futures price. This week's further fall to a 15%- year low owed more to the end- ing of a worrying dry spell in Brazilian growing areas. The November price dipped yester- day to Â£516 a tonne before clos- ing at Â£521, down Â£18 on the week. Traders thought the unrest in Zaire, a significant coffee producer, had little effect on sentiment in that market. Buat at the lindon Metal eN hm the Zaire atIor enoroo d a mid-week bounce, although dealer samid htmrats tof i rean metal dl not seem to have been aMected by the vio- lence and the state-owned Gecamlms was reorted to have ed that rodctiaon Ws noral Having tailed to breach overhead resistance the cash copper price fell back Â£11.50 yesterday to close at Â£1,349.50 a tonne, down Â£16 on the week. The mood changed in after- hours trading, however, when news emerged from Kinshasa that Gecamines' biggest copper and cobalt mines had been shut since Monday. Mr Umba Kyamitala, the company's pres- ident, said workers had not turned up at mines in the south since the disturbances (As at Thursday clo) Aknumnum +Aeoo wo7ero COppr -325 S030M Lead +2,125 ft5o3 To -Mo I1D \" started.

Thursday's annoncement that Reynolds Metals of the US would be shutting the two remaining pot lines at its Troutdale, Oregon, smelter from December had little effect on sentiment. Dealers said the move would need to be quickly followed by other producers if there was to be any impact on the world's heavy oversupply of the metal. But on the same day The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the biggest western producer, said it bad no plans to shut any of its North American production capacity. At the London bullion mar- ket gold silver and platinum were all showing significant gains on the week until silver led a general downturn yester- day. US investment fond buy- ing had helped the cash silver price to put on 1550 cents a troy ounmce before heavy loag- liquidation burst the bubble.

   "text_content" : "Wall Street ONCE AGAIN the stock mar- ket showed no inclination to break out of its current trading range, with share prices easing slightly across the board yes- terday in spite of a sharp decline in bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.18 at 3,006.04. The more broadly based Standard & Poors was a touch firmer, up 0.57 at 385.92, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks eased 2.46 to 524.48. Turnover on the NYSE was 161m shares. Advances and declines ran neck and neck at 763 to 765 respectively. Share prices have drifted this week because investors can find few reasons to buy stocks. The economy and the approaching third quarter cor- porate earnings season remain a worry. Although lower inter- est rates are making equities look more attractive than other forms of short-term invest- ment, institutions do not appear flush with cash. Even another fall in bond yields failed to stimulate inter- est. In late trading in the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1t to 103M, to yield to 7.819 per cent. General Dynamics ran into heavy profit-taking, falling $2%/ to $46%. The stock has been well-bid all week on expectations of healthy third quarter profits and possible plans for a stock buy-back or dividend increase. Pinnacle West rose $% to $13, a new 52-week high, after the Arizona-based public ser- vices and banking holding company continued its road show across the country. Hav- ing visited New York, Pinnacle was scheduled to meet Bos- ton's investment community yesterday and was expected to tell them that the company would reinstate its common stock dividend in late 1993. Control Data climbed $1% to $9% after announcing a restructuring plan that will divide the company into three entities. Global Natural rose sharply in early trading on news that the company will expand the oil production activities of its joint venture in the Soviet Union. The stock closed down $% at $8% On the over-the-counter mar- ket, several stocks went into a tailspin on warnings of poor third quarter profits. Leading the way down were Medical Imaging, $4% lower at $5 after talking of possible charges against earnings in the fourth quarter and losses in the third. Alias Research was down $fl% at $8, Weitek $1 lower at $6% and West One Bancorp $2% lower at $29%. Going the other way were Genelabs Technologies, up $1% at $11% in active trading and aided by a buy recommenda- tion from Prudential Securi- ties. The broker sees potential in a the pharmaceutical com- pany's anti-Aids drug. Canada TORONTO stock prices ended a lacklustre week in the same mode falling slightly in moder- ate trading. Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite index slipped 3.36 to 3381.78, for a loss on the week of about 25 points. Losing issues led winners by 267 to 234, volume dropped to 18.97m shares from yesterday's 20.00m shares, and trading value was C$278.3m compared with C$247.5m. Gold stocks slumped for the third straight day, as the price for the metal dropped $1.75 to $349.25 an ounce in New York. The gold index was off 1.61 per cent. International Semi-Tech said it and a partner have agreed to acquire a 32 per cent interest in Sansui Electric for nominal consideration, plus the injec- tion of up to $US5m for work- ing capital. The company also announced reported much higher six-month earnings. The stock was off % to 13 % in active trading. Rio Algom, unchanged at 15%, said it will close its Rio Kemptville tin mine in Nova Scotia.",

   "text_content" : "Tokyo SHARE PRICES rose initially yesterday on hopes of lower interest rates, but index-linked selling late in the afternoon eroded the gains and the Nik- kei average closed only mar- ginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The average ended 1.39 up at 23,969.47, for a gain of 3.3 per cent on the week. In the morn- ing, it reached a day's high of 24,157.61 - its first foray above the 24,000 level time since August 2 - as news of a small- er-than-expected rise in con- sumer prices during September prompted a rally in both the bond and equity markets. However, profit-taking and index-related selling pushed the index down to a day's low of 23,927.34 in the afternoon. Volume was unchanged at 500m shares, with foreigners and individuals leading the activity. Gains led losses by 512 to 475, with 152 issues unchanged.

   "text_content" : "HE TOKYO stock mar- ket has been battered so heavily over the past year that this week's unbroken run of day-to-day rises looked like a rally. In the end, though, the upward momentum fizzled n out when traders were faced 11 with the scary prospect of in pushing the Nikkei average in through the 24,000 level. :k The more positive tone to the market is a reflection, in r- part, of steadily falling market a interest rates, which ought to )r be reinforced before very long kg by another half-point cut in the 3l official discount rate to 5 per wr cent. Yet as foreign investors is continue to pile into the mar- :h ket - buying some Y4,500bn I. ($33.7bn) of Japanese shares in Y' the last year - the question Y' remains: when will domestic Y4 investors follow suit? The steady rise in the Nikkei re from the 21,500 area a month Y4 ago is unlikely to continue, let id alone be maintained, unless a- Japanese institutions and indi- i- vidual investors shift more al cash into equities. In principle n- this looks possible. Japanese investment trusts are now holding between 30 and 35 per - cent of their assets in cash. Yet in practice they are unlikely to steer this cash toward shares. \"Foreigners are betting that there is going to be a shift of money by domestic investors,\" says Mr Craig Chudler, strate- gist at UBS Phillips & Drew. 'This is a very false percep- tion.\" Mr Chudler has calcu- lated that, while cash may look abundant, investment trust holdings of equities are near historic highs at close to 50 per cent of assets. The trusts are seriously underweight in bonds, by historical standards, and are having to shell out close to Y500bn a month to investors who are taking their money home at record levels. They do not have cash to pro- pel stock prices forward. Pre- cisely the opposite: the rising market has provided increased opportunities to ditch shares to foreigners willing to pay more. \"There will be great selling pressure when the index reaches 25,000. This is a resis- tance zone,\" says Mr Munenori Wakita, first vice-president at Merrill Lynch Japan. The flip side of falling interest rates, which in any case have already been discounted by the market, is a liquidity squeeze, which is causing record levels of bank- ruptcies - hardly the stuff to Japan. Nikkei Average Index (000's) Discount rate (%) 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 Jan Source: DatmIream 7 push share prices higher. The Bank of Japan has not shown any sympathy for the stricken property sector. Indus- trial and financial corpora- tions, the biggest investors in the market, are cutting capital investment budgets, and prof- its are falling sharply. While they are not about to liquidate their extensive cross-holdings of shares, they need cash and are almost certain to be net sellers of equities in the next half year or so. \"The equity cycle in Japan is driven by the corporate liquidity cycle,\" says Mr Andrew Ballingal, analyst t at Barclays De Zoete Wedd. e Corporate liquidity has fallen i- sharply. While the factors limiting i any short-term rise in the mar- 1 ket are pretty well known, there could still be unexpected e items of bad news to drag e prices down suddenly. Corpo- s rate results for the first half of I the fiscal year will start to be t announced in another month, t and many analysts are warn- y ing that the results will be e much worse than is commonly s expected. Mr Ballingal says that profits could be down by p as much as 10 per cent on aver- il age. Bankruptcies are also e mounting at an alarming pace. v Even if the pace does not p quicken, the capacity of cash- - strapped financial institutions t to cope with a continuing high il volume of bad loans has been stretched to the limit. p Scandal is the most difficult a of all factors to anticipate. r With tedious regularity, r Japan's securities and financial f companies have made head- J lines this year with multi- i billion dollar improprieties v which have soaked up liquidity v and shaken confidence. The r biggest question mark now e hangs over the poorly regu- r lated non-bank sector. I In spite all of this, the for- 1 eign investors who piled into I the market over the summer did not necessarily get their timing wrong. The downside risk for an investor who entered the market at 21,500 is I probably small. It is widely I assumed that the government r would take action to support t the market should it fall below i that level on a sustained basis, c because of the severe liquidity N problems that would result. I Even if the government's i powers are limited, the belief itself helps to sustain price lev- els. Moreover - and this is why foreigners with cash and patience have bought equities - a light at the end of the tunnel is plainly visible, even if the tunnel is very long. The speculative excesses in property and financial assets are being squeezed out. Corpo- rate profits should begin to recover, although perhaps not for another year. The value of Japanese company share prices is no longer wildly out of line with other markets in the world, where share prices are near record highs. Japanese equity prices have fallen by roughly 50 per cent relative to prices in London and New York after hitting peaks in 1988. Eventually the liquidity squeeze will be over and Japan will return to a healthier path of economic growth. Some time between now and then, Japanese inves- tors are likely to have a change in sentiment - and have the cash to move the market, as well. When that happens, it will be no bad thing to be well invested in Tokyo.",

   "text_content" : "BOURSES were mostly weaker, with the exception of France, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed below its day's high. The CAC 40 index rose to 1,888.14, before closing at 1,883.80, up 7.31 on the day but barely changed on the week. Turnover was boosted by options-related activity to about FFr2.7bn. Suez slipped FFr2.10 to FFr319 in active trading of 456,675 shares, extending its weekly loss to 8.9 per cent because of its Zaire links. Pari- bas fell to a day's low of FFr432 before closing FFrl down at FFr440, after Thursday's flat half-year profits. Valeo, the motor components group, dropped FFrl7 or 3.1 per cent to FFr534 after Thursday's news of a 48 per cent fall in first-half net profits. The defence sector was strong, with Matra jumping FFr14.30 or 8 per cent to FFr192.20 and Thomson-CSF, which is to negotiate the sale to Taiwan of 16 frigates worth $4.8bn, rising FFrl.50 to FFr154.50 in heavy volume of 364,000 shares. Promodbs, the retailer, added FFr44 to FFr2,564 on pleasing first-half results. FRANKFURT digested a fresh warning on inflation from the Bundesbank, and signs of weakness in the machine and manufacturing tool sector. The DAX closed 11.85 lower at 1,608.14 after a fall of 3.58 in the FAZ at mid- session; losses on the week were 0.5 and 0.4 per cent respectively. Volume rose from DM3.4bn to DM3.8bn. An August drop in tool orders left Thyssen DM3.90 lower at DM228.10. Steels and cars were weak, as IG Metall's wage demands weighed on the sector. Daimler dropped DM8 to DM709.50. Other themes of the week were reflected in the weakness of Metallgesellschaft at DM444.50, down DM11.60 on the day and DM32.50 on the week. Similarly, Hochtief and Holzmann fell another DM15 to DM1,190 and DM18 to DM1,202, down DM60 and DM58 over five days on worries about the industry's prospects. ZURICH stayed with insur- ers, as the Credit Suisse index eased 0.3 to 514.4, down 1.8 per cent on the week. Yesterday BZW downgraded the market from overweight to neutral. Swiss Re certificates, SFr6 higher at SFr493, topped the active list. After the close it said that it would acquire a significant stake in fellow insurer, Elvia, which was up SFr30 at SFr3,040. Zurich Insur- ance bearers closed SFr90 higher at SFr4,220, and Winter- thur SFr70O at SFr3,480. Dealers said that the sector had under- performed in recent months. MILAN was little changed.

Fiat, which on Thursday reported a drop of 40 per cent in first half pre-tax profit, rose L2 to L5,220. Mr John Lon- ghurst at James Capel said that while most European vol- ume car manufacturers could expect a recovery in earnings next year, Fiat will be held back by a lack of new models. Olivetti fell L29 to L2251. After hours, the computer com- pany reported an unexpectedly large first half pre-tax loss. STOCKHOLM fell for the eighth day on worries about the financial sector and the political situation. The Affirs- vdrlden General index eased 12.8 to 1,030.0, down 3.9 per cent on the week, in volume of SKr550m after SKr525m. Electrolux free B shares fell SKr9 to SKr268 in the wake of a short-term recommendation from Kleinwort Benson to take profits in the stock, which has outperformed the market by 11 per cent on a three-month view and 57 per cent over 12 months. However, Kleinwort recommended that investors buy the stock for the long term when it falls below SKr265. MADRID declined, with the general index down 1.88 at 274.55 for a loss on the week of 0.7 per cent, in turnover of about Ptallbn. Fecsa, the utility, was suspended after falling Ptal4 on Thursday to Pta761 in heavy volume of 1.3m shares. Endesa, the state-controlled utility, announced a tender offer for 25 per cent of Fecsa shares at Pta785 each, which would raise its stake to 40 per cent. Endesa slipped Pta20 to Pta2,700. Asland was affected by the current weakness in cement shares, falling PtallO or 4.4 per cent to Pta2,365. HELSINKI fell to its fourth consecutive low for the year on continued concern about the current wage talks. The Hex index lost fell 6.30 to 860.70, down 4.1 per cent on the week.",

   "text_content" : "By Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent MR NEIL KINNOCK will use his Brighton conference address on Tuesday to signal that a Labour government will launch a national debate on the issue of electoral reform. Senior party leaders have confirmed that the Labour leader's speech is likely to indi- cate a new openness in the party to the possibility of aban- doning the first-past-the-post system for elections to the House of Commons. While Mr Kinnock is expec- ted to stop short of committing the party to a constitutional convention on electoral systems, he will take care not to rule out any options for a review that could involve experts and other interested parties from well beyond West- minster. His comments are certain to be attacked by the Tories and the Liberal Democrats as an attempt to reap the electoral benefits of backing reform without giving a definitive commitment to the change. THE LABOUR PARTY Is ahead of the Conservatives on a number of key Issues that could determine the result of the next general election, an ICM poll for the Daily Mail shows. Labour Is more popular than the Tories on seven of 11 Issues, Including health, education, unemployment, the environment and local government. Of most concern to the prime minister will be the poll's finding that Labour Is considered more likely than the Conservatives to raise people's standard of living. This week a new opinion poll by the Electoral Reform Soci- ety showed that 35 per cent of voters believed Labour would be more likely to win a general election if it backed propor- tional representation for all elections, including the Com- mons. Only 8 per cent of voters believed that the party would have less chance of victory. Until recently, Mr Kinnock has remained neutral on the electoral reform question in spite of mounting pressure from pro-reform lobbyists within the party. But in a party political broadcast this week he claimed he had always supported fixed-term parlia- ments. Last year conference over- ruled a recommendation of the national executive and opted to include discussion of the Com- mons in the remit of an inter- nal party committee, set up to examine systems for a devolved Scottish assembly, the European parliament and a reformed House of Lords. The Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform - now the party's largest single lobby group - is urging backing for a conference resolution calling - on the leadership \"to seize every opportunity to publicise and discuss Labour's new openness to electoral reform\". Opponents say that any pub- lic position-changing on the question will be used by the Conservatives to claim that the i party no longer believes it can win a general election under the current system. However, the LCER says that any accusation of oppor- i tunism is discredited by the fact that Labour started its debate when it was more than 20 points ahead in the polls. By raising the issue now, it i says, Labour is building on its commitments to explore all means possible to broaden i democracy. Labour's working party on electoral reform is due to issue i its full report sometime next spring, amid mounting specu- lation that it will come down firmly in favour of change.

   "text_content" : "By John Griffiths in Turin DOZING OFF at the wheel of your company car on the motorway as you head home after a hard day doesn't bear thinking about. In the not-too-distant future you won't have to, according to vehicle manufacturers. Cars available in the next decade or two will automati- cally \"sense\" that drivers are losing alertness by monitoring their behaviour and, using data-processing techniques, will take control of the car. Technology on show at a Turin exhibition yesterday, grouping the European Com- munity's main car makers, provided an awe-inspiring glimpse into what the industry says is feasible for the end of the decade or early 21st century. Projects include: * Advanced sensing systems allowing drivers to \"see\" through fog, and to make pedestrians visible in unlit streets to a driver up to 400m away, far beyond the range of dipped headlights; * Collision avoidance systems capable of taking control of the car from the driver in emergencies; * \"Co-operative driving\" - in which vehicles continuously exchange information with each other while on the road; * Computerised and satellite- based commercial vehicle fleet management systems; * A \"neural network\" system which uses sensors to monitor driver behaviour and reactions to determine whether he or she is losing alertness. The systems are the crea- tures of Prometheus, the col- laborative research pro- gramme set up in 1986 by the manufacturers, with financial aid from EC governments. The programme aims to improve safety by 30 per cent and traffic flow efficiency by at least 20 per cent by the year 2010, as well as expanding the European industry's tech- nology base to help fend off rising competition from Japan. Prometheus is an acronym for Programme for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety. The research programme, which involves 18 car manufacturers, 80 components companies and 124 research institutes, has been spending about Ecu90m (Â£63m) a year since work started in earnest in 1988-89. Apart from seeking to reduce deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents, the industry has produced statis- tics indicating that Ecu75bn, or 15 per cent of the EC's annual Ecu500bn transport-re- lated spending, is wasted through delays, excess fuel consumption, and other avoid- able inefficiencies.",

   "text_content" : "LNarional Westminster has abandoned the IMoral high ground with its decision to drop its long-standing policy of selling life insurance only through independent advisers. Coming hard on the heels of this week's similar move by Abber .National, tis debut in life insurance Will send ripples of anxiety through that indus- try. It spells deepening gloom for the independent brokers' market and the mutuals who rely on them. The banks' encroachment must ilso worry smaller proprietary companies like Britannic and Iefuge. Remarkably, NatWest reck- ons to join the ranks of the top 10 life insurers by 1994 for only modest outlay. Perhaps because it has less cash to throw around than Abbey National, it has eschewed acquisition. Its venture with Clerical Medical will provide the necessary expertise and still leave it firmly in control. Abbey National must be won- dering why it bothered to splash out Â£60m in goodwill for Scottish Mutual. Initially the venture will dilute NatWest earnings mar- ginally. From 1995 onwards it should theoretically generate a growing stream of quality income. The nagging worry is that banking ventures have a habit of ending in tears when the entire industry is bent on the same objective. The ulti- mate flaw in this case could be the creation of massive over- capacity. Branch networks give the banks a natural advantage in distribution, but life insur- ance is still labour-intensive. NatWest will have a 3,000- strong sales force devoted to a product under constant chal- lenge from more tax-efficient savings vehicles like PEPs. Perhaps its management is hoping for a Labour govern- ment to unwind tax incentives on rival products. Otherwise its insurance salesmen may yet find themselves somewhat short of work. Water sector Next Tuesday Ofwat will reveal the price increases that the water companies have asked for next year. What fol- lows will dictate the shape of price regulation up to the industry review in 1995. Ofwat has been aggressive in explor- ing the limits of its govern- ment licence, but it has yet to establish how its rules will work in the longer term. If it takes too tough a stance dur- ing the good times, consistency would suggest that the compa- nies will be allowed to pass on Ilk. h 1Uh oc sts to cus om e 1T0 120 Shai FT-r 140 100 120 110 100 90 Sou opel frig, 0 Wes its agr mul exti mea is b ma} incr hav teer thai Ofw redi set' of tl initi and its.

FT4E Index: 2,M +j3.4) TSB Share price relative to the FT-A Banks Index Sep'89 1990 1991 Sorer:Dltastream operating environment is less friendly later on. Of the 10 companies, South West may be allowed to raise its prices by more than the agreed inflation-linked for- mula, since it has to spend extra cash on anti-pollution measures. One other company is believed to have claimed its maximum allowable price increase. The remaining eight have apparently all volun- teered to raise prices by less than they might. The question is whether Ofwat agrees that the proposed reductions are sufficient to off- set the unexpected profitability of the businesses. If not, it can initiate a formal price review and claw back a share of prof- its. Current yields are dis- counting that possibility for a few of the companies, but not the further possibility that div- idend payments might be restricted as well. Those least at risk seem to be Anglian, Thames, Wessex and York- shire. TSB What once looked like a big day for TSB looks set to pass almost unnoticed. As of tomor- row, the 5 per cent limit on ownership is lifted, which in normal circumstances might open the door to a bid. After all, TSB has a thriving retail banking and insurance busi- ness. Despite what have some- times seemed like best efforts to lose money since its flota- tion in 1986, its capital is still considerably in excess of inter- nationally agreed require- ments. Though it is making a loss at the moment, earnings should recover as bad debt pro- visions diminish with the end of the recession. That a bid in fact looks unlikely is due only partly to lingering problems at Hill Sam- uel. A more important reason may be relevant to the banking industry generally. Wftb banks in many co to meet the new i ona capital requirement, have the resources to spa onu a large acquisition like TSB. Thus it seems hardly worth holding on to the shares in the hope a predator might ppear. As for the recovery pla v. ,Mid- land Bank has already outper- formed TSP by some- S'- per cent over, the past three months on Just that basis. BTR/Hawker After the respite from hostile bids in the past couple of years, the BTR offer document for Hawker Siddeley sweeps us back into the twilight world of the merchant banker. All the usual tricks of presentation are there, with the added spice of quotes from this newspaper taken out of context. Hawker's dismal record is dwelt upon in loving detail. BTR's perfor- mance is set in such glowing contrast that the naive reader would never guess that its profits are expected to fall this year for the second year run- ning. There is also a studied vagueness about what BTR actually means to do with Hawker. Since it is offering 18 times Hawker's historic earn- ings while its own shares stand on 13 times, a little more detail might be welcomed by BTR's shareholders. Despite all that, though, it scarcely seems con- ceivable that Hawker will retain its independence. The question is rather whether its share price, at 751p, deserves to be 18p above the paper value of the offer. Lopex Shareholders in the commu- nications group Lopex have an intriguing proposition to dis- cuss at their egm in 10 days' time. Lopex, it may be recalled, lost over 80 per cent of its net asset value last year and has just passed its interim divi- dend. The directors have the usual share options, which because of the near-80 per cent fall in the share price in the past three years are-aow worthless. They therefore pro- pose to issue fresh ones up to the amount of 10 per cent of the equity. Shareholders might ask themselves why, if the company is about to outper- form, the directors - whose salaries last year ranged up to Â£230,000 - do not simply buy in the market. They might also ask why the board's holding - a mere 1.6 per cent - has fallen in the past six months.",

   "text_content" : "uerry ion NE THING that every foreigner learns in Japan is that no matter what you do, no matter how long you stay or how hard you study, you will never be quite right. No visitor should take this per- sonally. It is the consequence of a very old and fundamental separa- tion between East and West. My first experience of this divide was in a tea ceremony. It was given by a Master of Urasenke in a tea house near Kyoto. And from the moment I knelt to enter that tiny room I felt out of place. Not only did I know nothing about the rules appropriate to the occasion, but even my body was the wrong shape. In the company of those who had the form bred into their bones, who moved with exquisite precision, whose every gesture was controlled in ritual perfection, I was a clumsy oaf. With pride and knees hurt, I left in confusion. I came back, though, to study and practice tea, and ran straight into another formidable barrier - Japan's Ten Year Rule. This is an understanding, implicit in almost every aspect of Japanese life, that it is impossible to learn how to do anything worthwhile in less than ten years of dedicated apprentice- ship. The traditional arts are actu- ally known collectively as keiko- goto or \"things learned by practice.\" And the rules of tea, I was told, were so demanding that one could practice them for a lifetime without attaining perfection. Nothing, they said, could be achieved in a year. But a year was all I could spare. So, looking for a Master who might bend the rules a little, I went to see one who taught in a tea house attached to an ancient monastery. People had described him as \"won- derfully spontaneous\", which seemed an odd term in connection with a discipline as precise and rig- orous as tea; but they were right. He was so much a master of the stylised movements for preparing and serving tea that he could relax within the confines of the tradition and express his own personality. He was so confident in technique that he was free to elaborate on the rit- ual in the same way that a great pianist may do with a familiar con- certo. I plucked up enough courage to approach this sensei. He was aghast at first, then amused, and finally willing at least to take me seriously. He would take mb on in spite of my obvious shortcomings, if I agreed to live in, wash up and start every day before dawn. In addition to lessons in tea, I must study a martial art with equal emphasis. I reluctantly picked kendo - fenc. ing with wooden staves - and after several months spent half on my knees and half in combat, I made an amazing discovery. The sensei was right. Tea and kendo go well together. The more I learned to focus my energy in the martial art, the better able I was to refine my performance of tea. The more patient I became within the strict demands of the tea ceremony, the more successful I was in contests with the stave. Each discipline com- plemented the other, deepening my understanding of a common frame of mind which is reflected in the ancient code of bushido - the \"way of the warrior.\" This is the essence of Japan. Beneath all the talk of honour and loyalty lies a belief that history is the only true source of spirit and skill. Once I understood that, I saw why my tea master had insisted I study kendo, and I soon wanted to Lyall Watson argues that sumo is more than just heavyweight wrestling: it reveals the importance of ritual in Japanese life look at other martial arts. I went to the oldest and purest, sumo, and became entranced. Most organised sport leaves me cold. But sumo moved me with its drama, its conflict and suspense, touched me with its dignity, with the sight of winners who take their victories with quiet courtesy and losers who accept their fates with simplicity and grace. I enjoyed the colour and the texture, but what really excited me was the sense of being, if only for the day, part of another world, of a lost way of life. I was conscious of being present at a ceremony involving the last of the samurai, part of a ritual whose dev- otees live and work, eat and play in another time. Ritual provides vital continuity and gives form and meaning to human life. It is not just social deco- ration, nor a gloss upon the things we do on special occasions. It struc- tures and enriches every aspect of our daily lives. Or at least it should. I believe it is possible to trace all the destructive ills to which west- ern society now seems vulnerable to a lack of such appropriate cere- mony. Young people break things and challenge institutions they find irrelevant. They try, in the codes and costumes of their groups, to set up rituals of their own. But because such fashions lack roots, history and meaning, they are soon sup- planted by the next craze. True ritual behaviour is a power- ful pattern of communication. It carries information from another time, telling of how individuals may interact with each other, or with their gods, in orderly and meaning- ful ways. Rites enable us to know who we are and how we got here, and to make choices about what we should do next. Superficially they are patterns of repetitive or rhyth- mic behaviour which synchronise events. But they act directly on our nervous systems, setting profound unconscious processes in action. These may seem absurdly grand claims to make for a sport, but it is worth taking a close look at some of the ceremonies involved in every session of sumo - including those next monthin the Royal Albert Hall. The action each day begins with the rhythmic clacking of hyoshigi, the traditional cherry wood clap- pers which highlight significant moments and attract an audience's attention. The rhythm is oddly dis- turbing. It is precisely that which, as laboratory studies show, stimu- lates the right hemisphere of the brain, the one that generates emo- tion instead of logic. In other words, it is the sort of sound which can separate ordinary \"profane\" time from ritual or \"sacred\" time, prepar- ing those who hear it for something special. It synchronises an audience to the same beat, unconsciously \"tuning\" everyone together and decreasing their personal space. The \"Rite of Access\" begins out of sight of the people, behind their backs in one of the passageways, beyond their conscious awareness. But as the sound spreads and the group moves down the hanamichi, the path along which flowers were once strewn at the feet of a reli- gious procession, they gradually become visible to more and more of the congregation. The referee leads the way, taking on the role of high priest in his bright ceremonial robe, moving slowly into everyone's con- sciousness, focussing attention, act- ing as a metaphor for the increase in group cohesion. The procession pauses at the edge of the central area, shifting the audience's attention to the raised ring under its bright lights and evocative Shinto canopy. The ghoji (referee) steps up first onto the sacred ground of the dohyo. The wrestlers follow in their most expensive costumes, penetrating the realm of the holy. Each is given special sanction to do so, not only by revealing his ritual name, but by announcing his place of birth. This has always been a scary moment for us, a critical point in the history of all patterns of wor- ship, when the chosen few, acting on behalf of the whole community, trespass on the territory of the gods. So invasion of the sanctuary must be followed directly by a \"Rite of Penance\" in which the celebrants deal with the congregation's fear. If they are ordinary wrestlers, each faces the centre, claps his hands to announce that his body has been purified, lifts his ceremo- nial apron to indicate that he has been properly prepared, and holds both arms aloft to show that he has come unarmed and is placing him- self at the mercy of the gods. If the actor is a yokozuna, the ring-entering is far more elaborate. Each grand champion has moral support in the form of two friends, acting as herald and sword-bearer. He wears his heavy white tsuna belt, which is a copy of the rope that hangs from Shinto shrines and gateways, calling attention to his status as an acolyte of the guardian spirits. And he moves with deliber- ate solemnity as guardian himself of the dignity of sumo. The yokozuna begins his penance by bringing his palms together in a loud clap of attention. Then he rubs his hands in ritual cleansing, end- ing with the open-handed gesture of submission before rising to go to the centre of the sacred ground. Like most things in Shinto, mean- ing is never clearly defined, but the entire ring-entering ceremony, or dohyo-iri, is believed to represent a prayer to the gods for tranquillity in the universe and peace and abun- dance in the nation. What the grand champion actually does is to make a mighty shiko stamp to scare away stray demons before bending low at the knees to make himself as small and as penitent as he can. Then he undergoes a remarkable transfor- mation. Facing north, fixing his gaze ahead in a way which defies anyone to notice that he is wrig- gling his feet beneath him, he glides forward, gradually rising to his full height, turning from man to super- man as he goes, uniting earth and heaven in one person. And then he stamps again, in defiance, as the crowd roars its acclamation. At the end of their respective doh- yo-iri, all wrestlers bow and file out, reversing their path, going back as it were into the unconscious, chang- ing behind the scenes into another costume so that they can return later, fresh and forgiven, ready for action on another new day. There are many more rituals involved in the return - including the drinking of \"power water\" from the hand of an unbeaten fellow wrestler, the sprinkling of salt to purify the fighting ground, and a range of older movements drawn not so much from religious cere- mony as from biological origins involving the meeting of rival males at the edge of their territories. Every rikishi learn the patterns so well that they become automatic. Like tea masters, the best develop elaborations and refinements, which become part of a personal repertoire of expression. I am cer- tain that not even the most experi- enced sumotori is consciously aware of the deep significance of what he is doing. He does not need to be. His actions make a difference, changing all who take part, just as the Chris- tian Mass affects its celebrants. For me the beauty and potency of the sumo rites is that they invade the real world, taking place in front of a community which is carried along by the ancient energies. Yet i everyone also eats and drinks and talks as it all goes on, almost as if they were at a picnic. I admire this ability to mix the sacred and the profane, to deal with the world as one finds it, taking strength from the past and applying i it without discomfort to the present. In Britain, also, ceremony is an important part of the national heri- tage. I am sure that is why all five performances of the first Grand Sumo Tournament in London were sold out long ago. With its colour, its ritual, style and dignity, sumo is like a cross between a Cup Final and the Trooping of the Colour. For all its exotic forms sumo is in I essence very British. i LYALL WATSON presents the sumo programmes on Channel Four. Dominic Lawson on the appeal of boxing - page 22"

   "text_content" : "THE HEAT is on for our leading financial institutions. Four years after the stock market crash and more than three years into a hous- ing market slump - which has badly affected the demand for mortgage repayment plans - many of the life insurance companies are strug- gling to find a survival strategy. This week one of the proud Scottish independents, Scottish Mutual, agreed to sell out to Abbey National. It is not the first to demutualise in this way - a much smaller Glasgow office called FS Assurance was bought by Britannia Building Society two years ago - but the strains are obviously being felt by larger companies. A few of the biggest mutually-owned life groups, such as Standard Life and Norwich Union, still pull in large volumes of business, but even here the long-term future may not be clear. Standard Life, for example, depends on Halifax Building Society for much of its business just as Friends Provident has relied on Abbey. But now Friends Provident is left, well, largely friendless and unprovided for. And Standard chose this same week to announce it was abandoning its tra- ditional with-profits endowment mort- gage policy - the one which rolls up various annual and terminal bonuses - in favour of a unitised version. Trouble comes in threes, and the week's other big event in this area was yesterday's announcement that National Westminster is to abandon its struggle to remain an independent adviser on investments. Instead it is setting up NatWest Life, with the help of Clerical Medical The effective ending of the availability of independent advice in the high street (aside from Bradford & Bingley and one or two other minor players) has been predictable, but it remains deeply worrying. I have on a number of occasions in the past criticised the way that the reg- ulators in the UK have approached the marketing of retail investment prod- ucts, and some of my fears are in the process of being realised. Many inde- pendent life companies and unit trust companies are being viciously squeezed, but the big banks and buiding societ- ies, meantime, are being motivated to buy or set up their own providers of investment products. The problems revolve around so-called polarisation, the principle recently re-endorsed by the watchdogs at the Securities and Investments Board. Those individuals and compa- nies engaged in marketing investments, ranging from solo salesmen to the mighty NatWest, with its 3,000 UK branches, must choose between tying to a single investment company or selling the products of all companies on an equal basis. They cannot sell their own brand alongside two or three top inde- pendent names chosen for their perfor- mance, value and quality, which is how most non-financial supermarkets approach the problem of selling baked beans or toothpaste. Supposedly, polarisation protects the customer from various abuses, such as the channelling of extra kickbacks to the inter- mediary and the provision of biased advice. But here is how it will actually work at Abbey National. At present, Abbey customers seeking endowment mortgages or personal pensions are sold policies with Friends Provident, which has an excellent track record for the popular with-profits plans. It is the fifth-best performer for 25-year con- tracts according to a survey of almost 50 life companies by the trade magazine Money Management. But from 1993 Abbey's borrowers will be sold policies of Scottish Mutual - which has a pretty dismal record in this area, scor- ing below average on any term from 10 to 25 years. Over most terms Friends is paying some 20 per cent more than Scottish Mutual. True, the policies will be issued in the name of a new company, Abbey National Life, but most of the expertise will be supplied by Scottish Mutual. Can it really be in the interests of cus- tomers to switch from an established and successful life company to one which is either poor or alternatively is a new and unknown quantity? Of course not, but Abbey is being driven by powerful commercial sores. To have bought a more successful life company would inevitably have cost a lot more. Now, it will secure all the profits to be made out of selling life policies, not just the intermediary's commissions. There is a lot of money, but little logic, in these mortgage-linked con- tracts. No matter that in practice only a tiny percentage of endowment mort- gage plans remain in payment long enough to redeem the loan, the fact is 100 per cent of them pay handsome returns to intermediaries and life com- panies. At least the SIB has begun won- dering out loud whether endowment mortgages are really \"suitable\" if so few fulfil their purpose, but it has never shown the courage to tackle the power- ful life industry in the past. The with-profits formula faces a sepa- rate crisis regardless of, or perhaps because of, its astonishing recent suc- cess. A with-profits investment plan achieves the apparently impossible by paying out a relatively steady return despite the volatility of the stock mar- ket. Millions of investors terrified at the thought of another stock market crash have therefore been flocking to buy with-profits policies. U nfortunately, in the world of investment, the herd is all too often wrong. The with- profits formula is an inge- nious method developed by clever actu- aries to smooth out market fluctuations but it must not be pushed too far and it can be dangerous to extrapolate past trends. For many companies, 25-year plans are now maturing only in tiny numbers (few were issued in 1966, and most have anyway since lapsed) and it is cheap to declare high terminal bonuses on a handful of surviving policies. But these payouts bear no relation to the bonuses which could be sustained on the millions of with-profits contracts now being issued. Cynics will see the moves by Standard Life and other com- panies from the traditional with-profits formula as an attempt to broaden their product base before with profits bonuses are heavily cut. It has not been a good week for friends and standards in more senses than one, and the concept of indepen- dence advice in retail investment has taken another battering.

   "text_content" : "HE CRIES of pain you heard during the late spring and early sum- mer can now be explained. They came from a corporate sector carrying out an unnatural act, one that has not been seen in recent mem- ory: paying back money to the banks. Seasonally adjusted figures published yesterday show that the UK's industrial and com- mercial companies received net financing from the banks of minus Â£4bn in the second quar- ter of 1991. In no previous quarter since the early 1980s has the sum been negative. As recently as the third quarter of 1989, UK companies were bor- rowing from the banks at the rate of Â£4bn a month. UK companies were able to repay their borrowing for two reasons. First, they were run- ning down stocks sharply (the record borrowing in the third quarter of 1989 was the reverse effect: a rapid run-up in stocks as the economy started to slow). Second, they were in the middle of the wave of rights issues that has been a feature of this year. Until the banks recover their enthusiasm for lending to UK companies, the corporate sec- tor will have to generate the cash it needs from operations, or from new stock and bond issues. The pressure will be greatest once the recovery gets under way, as companies start to rebuild stocks to meet rising demand. Cash flow is likely to be a au significant yardstick to use for te judging companies over the a- early part of the next cycle. A ie recent analysis by Hoare a Govett, focusing on cash, picks it out companies in food manu- is facturing and electricity supply a- as relatively attractive when ie share prices are compared with cash flow forecasts. Contract- ,s ing and construction compa- it nies, and some in the stores i- sector look relatively unattrac- at tive on this measure. If Food retailing is also poten- r- tially unattractive. Although it is is naturally a cash-rich busi- Is ness, the ambitious supermar- a ket building programmes of >f the big stores groups will put r- pressure on cash flow over the Le next few years. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll have all o strengthened their balance o sheets recently with rights - a- issues or property sale-and- 1 e leasebacks. The two weaker d competitors - Asda and Gate- i e way - both have specific prob- 1 s lems. I o Asda, indeed, has been at the 1 e centre of speculation this s week. It is still without a chief i e executive; and there have been i press reports forecasting a r Â£300m rights issue. This week, I K its shares fell 15p to close at I 55p. There are persistent sug- e gestions - perhaps wishful t i, thinking as much as anything I I else - that the company may t e be a target for a foreign t s retailer wishing to enter the t UK's highly lucrative super- I g market business. Asda's fate is of keen impor- I a tance to the other big food FT-SE 100 Index Relative to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index 11( source: uarmeam Soume. Ljauwjoam 9! retailers: if the company lin- gers on in a half-life, squeezed so badly that it is unable, over time, to refurbish its stores to meet the aggressive competi- tion from the Big Three, they will gradually gobble up its customers. If a new chief exec- utive decides retrenchment to Asda's north-of-England heart- land is the long term answer, the sale of its southern sites will allow rivals to fill gaps in their networks or eliminate local competition. Both those two scenarios are bullish for the Big Three. But if Asda were to be bought by an aggressive over- seas competitor with deep pockets - particularly one used to competing on price, like the German chains - that would be bad news for the other supermarket groups. At best, they would be unable to profit as soon as they had expected from the greater con centration in the market on which their aggressive expan- sion is partly predicated; at worst, they might face a threat to the comfortably plump mar- gins that distinguish British food retailing. Such longer-term consider- ations were markedly absent from the market's principal drama this week, the British Aerospace affair. Meetings were cancelled at the compa- ny's head office, and all work at the top seemed to cease as directors confronted the chair- man, Prof Sir Roland Smith over several days. The share price lifted slightly in anticipa- tion of his fate. On Wednesday night, he went; on Thursday, the share price rose 3p. At its current price - it closed on Friday at 413p, down 15p on the week - the company is valued at Â£l.lbn, roughly the same as Pilkington or Siebe, and only two thirds as much as Williams Holdings. The current share price is only 33p above the price of its current rights issue. The con- tinued slide in the price after Sir Roland's departure indi- cates that the market's doubts about the group's strategy go deeper than just a mistrust of the former chairman's deal- making. They may not be resolved until a new perma- nent chairman is found to take over from Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman (who currently enjoys the rare dis- tinction of chairing three FT-SE companies: BAe, Power- Gen and Cadbury Schweppes). BAe was not the only casu- alty of the week. Another vic- tim was Lep, the security and freight forwarding group in which ADT has a 27 per cent stake. Its shares more than halved on Monday, falling 51p to close at 36p after announc- ing that it was in talks with its bankers and that profits would be sharply lower than expec- ted. The shares closed the week at 27p, a drop of 60p or 69 per cent. Vickers also suffered from a profit disappointment. On Thursday, it announced a pre- tax interim loss of Â£4.3m, because of a sharp downturn in sales of Rolls-Royce cars. The shares, which had been drift- ing downwards in anticipation of the bad news, dropped 20p on the day to close the week at 179p, down lip. With this spate of bad news - including a Â£280m rights issue from Hillsdown - it was perhaps surprising that the market ended the week virtu- ally unchanged. The FT-SE closed the week at 2599.0, down 1.3. The index is 3 per cent below its high of 2679.6, reached on September 2 1991. The performance relative to New York, shown in the chart, reflects London's relative underperformance in Septem- ber. As Sir Roland Smith would no doubt be the first to agree, it has not been a partic- ularly good month. Peter Martin",

Several bonuses are on offer to investors during the first two weeks after the trust's re-launch. People buying units on October 2 will receive a 1 per cent bonus on investments from Â£500 to Â£49,999, and a 1.25 per cent bonus on investments of more than Â£50,000. In the following two weeks, until October 18, the bonuses will be 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent. Minimum lump sum investment is Â£500, and a Â£30 per month savings scheme is available. Scottish Widows is optimistic that this is a good time to concentrate on Japan, and the graph of the Nikkei Dow index seems to bear out the comment by David Graham, of Scottish Widows, that \"most of the bad news about the Japanese economy is now fully reflected in the price\". Racal bid lifts Vodafone VODAFONE, the former \"twin\" of Racal Electronics, has enjoyed a surge on the stock market. Racal Electronics was subjected to a formal bid from Williams Holdings to force its share price up, but Vodafone's price has risen thanks to favourable sentiment, and the widespread belief that it will be a bid target soon. The main increase in demand for Vodafone shares came on Tuesday, after it was announced that a bid had been made for Metro Mobile, the US cellular radio group, by Bell Atlantic. However, analysts disagree on the stock's underlying value, and the shares ended the week only 5p stronger at 378p. Hambros launches two new PEPs HAMBROS has launched two new personal equity plans. The Hambros Unit Trust PEP allows you to invest up to Â£3,000 in up to three of Hambros' Model Portfolio Trust, Equity Income Trust, and Smaller Companies Trust. There is no additional charge for investing via a PEP than there would be for buying the unit trusts direct. The Hambros Bank PEP is more complicated, and allows up to Â£6,000 to be invested in one of four individual plans.

   "text_content" : "T HERE HAVE been few recent success stories in the UK insurance industry - but two sets of figures pub- lished this week indicate that not everything in the insur- ance garden is blighted. On Monday Lloyd Thomp- son, the insurance broker which was inauspiciously listed on the day the stock market crashed in October 1987, posted a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30. A day later Domestic & Gen- eral, which insures domestic appliances such as refrigera- tors and televisions against breakdown, notched a 46 per cent increase in profits for the same period. The company is on course to record profits of Â£5.7m for the fdll year. Both companies are small - with turnover around 30m - but have done consistently well since obtaining stock mar- ket listings. oyd Thompson profits have grown at an aver- age rate of 282 per cent since 1967. Profits at Domestic & General have increased at an average rate of 43.4 per cent since 1988. Their shares have reflected this strong performance. Over the past four years Lloyd Thompson shares have outper- formed the FT-A All Share by 60 per cent. The shares are on historic price/earnings ratio of 21.5 and a prospective p/e of 18. D & G's price has hardly stopped rising since its shares were placed on the unlisted securities market at 165p in May 1988. The shares were trading at around 763p yester- day, an rise in nominal terms of more than 360 per cent. The shares are on a historic pie of 15.7 and a prospective pie of 138. Over the past two months, D & G has outper- formed the rest of the insur- ance sector by 91 per cent and the All-Share by 78 per cent. Both companies' results are in sharp contrast to the bulk of the general insuranc sector. The UK's composite insurers have recorded disastrous results in the past 18 motths. Companies such as Guardian I 1 t i r f i I 1 f f i i s B B a L 1 Martn Copltof Domnea & e Royal Exchange and Royal Â» Insurance have chalked up their first ever pretax losses. One company, Trade Indem- I nity - the trade credt insurer, in which the composites have a maor stakes - has been so I badly mauled by the recession that it did not declare an Sinterim dividend. a Whereas Britain's composite SIuers ell everythnag trom 1 motor insurance to pension plans, more successful smaller companies tend to focus on rel- atively specialised sectors. Lloyd Thompson and D & G specialise in very different sec- tors of the insurance market, but a common thread runs through their success. Both can justifiably lay claim to being the industry leaders in their specialised fields. Chris Hitchings, an analyst with Hoare Govett, says: \"The secret of both companies is actually quite simple - by being very good at what you do, you create a product which is materially better than the competition and on that basis you grow market share and to some extent even the market itself.\" Lloyd Thompson built its reputation in the energy risks market - boking insurances for oil companies. It has enjoyed the benefits of a flat and flexible management structures. Staff - d leainr individual - have been menouagld by gem- ross incentives. D & G hba also benefited Tr from a more focused approach. 1- Following unsuccessful diversi- fication into motor insurance 5 and mortgage broking, the company is concentrating t, exclusively on its domestic s appliance business. But as well h as insuring domestic appli- o ances against breakdown, it n offers to repair damaged equip- ment and has built up a data- it base of recommended repair e services. s Customers not only receive y payment for any repair costs, a D & G also ensures that the h repairs are done quickly and e efficiently. As a result, custom- s ers tend to renew their poli- o cles, while D & G has a consid- it erable degree of control over its dainms costs. a flitchings suggests that the a strengths of D & G and Lloyd s Thompson reside in the fact a that they have anticipated the Lt shape of future treds in the It insurance industry, which is y tmely to become much more - geared aroud tomer need. - Inded, with growth et to co- tinue, the only problem d a, u, to be the reltive lck of liquidity in both company's shares. Martin Copley, who owns just over 30 per cent of the company's shares, admits that the group has considered a rights issue to fund further expansion in a business which has proved surprisingly resil- ient to recession. At the moment the company does not intend to raise more capital. Lloyd Thompson, mean- while, said it was proposing a one for one capitalisation issue - designed to increase liquid- ity in the share and ease trad- ing by institutions. Some analysts suggest that, with the worst over, now is the time to invest in the bigger companies. The weaker compe- nies such as GRE and Royal are judged to be interesting recovery stocks by some. Rven so, with another year of loses in 1992 a distinct possibility this appears to be a slightly risky strategy. The smaller insurance companies may be better bets. RicrWd Lwpper",

   "text_content" : "T HIS WEEK Wall Street's traders have been unable to keep their minds off an \"October bottom\". No, it has nothing to do with the next Playmate of the Month, nor is it a kinky new twist to the \"October Surprise\" conspiracy. Instead, the \"bottom\" they are concentrating on is the moment next month when share prices hit the floor with a thud. The market has gone nowhere in the past few weeks because, in the absence of any incentives to buy, investors have been looking for an excuse to sell. Judging by the halting form of stock prices this week - only a brief flurry of programme trading on Tuesday broke the pattern of dreary decline - the market is teetering on the edge of a size- able sell-off. Wall Street watchers believe investors could be pushed over that edge by poor third quar- ter corporate results, which will start coming in next month. If share prices do take a dive, market professionals - a loose term to describe the dealers and cannier investors - will be on hand to rush in 111 and pick up the bargains. ve This view suggests that I ep there is a solid floor to the - in market, probably at or near 3 as 2,900 on the Dow, the mark at xt which the bargain hunters is would make their move. There he is less certainty, however, 3 y. about where the ceiling is. ry Money may have been seeping ie into equities recently because m of declining yields on savings 3 th accounts, certificates of depos- ie its and money market funds, ks but the steady output of ly gloomy economic statistics has 2 rs kept hopes for a substantial in market rally in check. ie This week provided more 2 es evidence that the economy, ry while up from its sickbed, is in still groggy from almost a year of spent flat on its back. Tuesday 2 is saw a drop in consumer confi- e- dence reported by the Confer- ence Board - a sign that con- tt re sumers have been slow to b er respond to statistical evidence w r- of an economic recovery with a :h a recovery in their expecta- a ct tions. qi re A 3.8 per cent decline in a - durable goods orders for fr te August was also reported - 0. rs although hidden in the report c in were some goodish manufac- Dow Jones Industrial Average 3100 3050 3000 2950 2900 2850 July August September turing numbers - as was a bigger-than-expected rise in weekly claims for unemploy- ment insurance, and a totally unforeseen revision in second quarter gross national prod- uct. The estimate was changed from an originally calculated 0.1 per cent decline to a 0.5 per cent decline. The revision to the GNP total was particularly worry- ing. It suggested that the econ- omy was in a deeper trough between April and June than previously thought. It also implies that any recovery in economic performance during the third quarter will also have been overstated. Against the background of a faltering economy, the outlook for third quarter company profits is not rosy. This list of companies reorganising in anticipation of tough times ahead grows longer by the day. This week Union Carbide disclosed plans to cut its work- force over the next three years by 14.5 per cent - which will lead to 5,500 employees losing their jobs. Combined with other steps, Union Carbide hopes to boost pre-tax earn- ings by $250m by 1994. In the more immediate future, the cost-cutting means means the company will take a fourth quarter charge of between $100m-$150m. Yet amid the gloom this week there was some better news from a few corporate giants. General Dynamics was the subject of heavy demand from investors after the com- pany forecast that its quar- terly earnings would come in above analysts estimates of $1.50 a share. William Anders, chairman of the nation's sec- ond biggest defence contrac- tor, said the benefits from its recently introduced pro- gramme to reduce the size of the company, cut payroll costs and increase productivity were being realised sooner than originally envisaged. A good part of the extra cash General Dynamics expects to make will be handed back to sharehold- ers, either through a buy-back of stock, an increase in the dividend, or some form of spe- cial distribution or self tender. McDonald's was another big name to predict a quarter that will confound experts' opinion. The company's stock was actively traded on Thursday after the management dis- closed that June to September profits and sales will top those achieved a year ago. Typical of its drive to find Innovative ways to sell its product, McDonald's announced that its burgers will be available to young pas- sengers on United Airlines flights to Orlando, the Florida home of Disneyworld. Eating a Big Mac while travelling at speed should give new mean- ing to the term \"fast food\".

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor A DVICE IS a precious commodity, and Brit- ish consumers have just lost another source of it. The news of a joint venture between National Westminster Bank and Clerical Medical may not sound too alarming. But it means that a major provider of independent advice has disap- peared. As Barry Riley explains in the Long View (Page I), the Financial Services Act created a division between \"indepen- dent\" advisers and the tied agents of a particular com- pany. The fundamental flaw in the regime was that the system of paying financial advisers was unaltered. The commission system means that, to make a living, advisers must sell life insurance-related products. So the act in effect created two classes of life insurance salesmen. \"Best advice\", to which the consumer has been theoretically entitled after the act, has come to mean the recommendation of the best life insurance company, not the best product for the con- sumer's needs. Selling, for example, national savings or index-linked gilts does not earn an adviser commission. Now even the limited inde- pendence of some advisers is fast disappearing. The security that comes from being linked to a particular company, the regulatory costs involved in being independent, the simplic- ity of having to understand only one company's product range, rather than a hundred's - all these have led to a grad- ual shift towards the tied sec- tor. The NatWest link-up is only the latest example, and it leaves Bradford & Bingley Building Society as the largest independent financial adviser. NatWest will also set up its own life insurance company, as will Abbey National, which this week agreed to buy Scot- tish Mutual (see Page IV). But to add to the consumer's confusion, NatWest will retain a specialist broker subsidiary to offer independent financial advice. The system created by the Financial Services Act means that large financial companies can have both tied and independent subsidiaries. It is tempting to dismiss the whole thing as a dog's break- fast, except that any self- respecting hound would turn his nose up at it. Consumers may not under- stand all the nuances but they are definitely dissatisfied. A Mintel survey this week found that 60 per cent of women felt patronised by the financial ser- vices industry. They agreed with the statement that \"finan- cial companies talk down to women because they think women are not capable of understanding money\". I am not surprised that women feel this way. Financial companies seem rooted in an era when the husband went to work leaving a housewife at home to vacuum and tend the two kids. Pity, for example, the woman who keeps her maiden 'Finance is a conspiracy against the laity' name after marriage and tries to convince her bank or mort- gage company not to rename her Mrs Smith, But I still have the feeling that the Mintel survey might just as well have concluded: \"Financial companies talk down to people because they think people are not capable of understanding money.\" The fact is that a lot of peo- ple are baffled by finance, and many simply find the whole subject completely tedious. Like all professions, finance is a conspiracy against the laity; it deliberately dresses itself up with jargon to make itself more complicated. The greater the complexity, the easier it is to argue that people who work in the business deserve to earn six figure salaries. The problem is that the staff who actually deal with the public - who are paid much less than the high-fliers in the City - frequently have the same problems as the rest of us. They know enough to deal with a specific product or field, but they then stick tenaciously and inflexibly to their chosen formula or script, and flounder when confronted with the unexpected. An obvious example is the endowment mortgage, one of the most prominent examples of a life insurance related prod- uct. My colleague Schehera- zade Daneshkhu recounted in July her attempts to obtain a repayment mortgage, which was obviously the most suit- able loan for her circum- stances. The adviser at the Woolwich, confused by such stubborn resistance from a member of the public, tried to clinch the argument by repeat- edly insisting that \"an endow- ment mortgage is more of a reality\". Such gobbledegook is com- monplace. The growth of the tied business means that, as consumers, we will be continu- ously confronted with individu- als and companies whose liveli- hoods depend on selling us particular products. We may not want life-linked products, but we are damn well going to have them. In the par- rot phrase of the industry: \"Life insurance is not bought; it has to be sold.\" The depressing cycle will continue; consumers buy prod- ucts they do not understand, give up contributing after a few years, become disgusted with the returns from early encashment and switch to a new policy for the cycle to begin again. Worse still, in a tied system, the fees and charges paid by the consumer are much harder to discover. Whichever government is next elected needs to give seri- ous attention to the deal that consumers receive from the financial services industry. In the meantime, Weekend FT readers are advised to seek out those few advisers who can claim to be both independent and disinterested - the fee- charging sector.",

Which is better - a unit or an investment trust? Both offer private investors a diversified portfolio, and access to small markets that might otherwise be denied them. Each has its advantages and disadvantages (summar- ised in the table below). Invest- ment trusts have the longer pedigree - dating back to the 1860s; unit trusts, founded in the 1930s, are relative upstarts. For much of the last 30 years, however, the unit trust industry has won the sales bat- tle with ease. It has done so by allying itself closely with the life industry (through the sale of unit-linked life assurance, endowment mortgages and pensions) and by paying 3 per cent commission on sales to independent financial advisers. But over the last seven years, investment trusts have been fighting back. Savings schemes have been introduced - offering small investors a chance to enjoy the benefits of equity investment at very low cost. Trusts have also started to woo the IFA with commis- sion and to link their shares to other savings products. This year's burst of invest- ment trust activity has been prompted by two factors. The first is that a quirk in the Per- sonal Equity Plan rules allows a full Â£6,000 to be placed in stock market new investment trust issues, compared with Â£3,000 for normal investment and unit trust holdings. Since unit trusts are not quoted, they cannot qualify for the full Â£6,000. The second reason for the surge in investment trust pop- Tracker trust JAMES CAPEL is set to launch a unit trust which will allow investors a to track the perfor- mance of smaller companies, writes Philip Coggan. The Trixie index fund will track stocks which are mem- bers of the FT-A All-Share Index and have market capital- isations between Â£20m and Â£400m. The fund will be the first indexed trust to track small company performance. There are 385 stocks in the Trixie index, but the fund will hold about 150 shares, giving it a tracking error of around 2 per cent a year. James Capel says the Trixie index, while not as broad as either the Hoare Govett or County NatWest smaller com- panies indices, contains more quid stocks. The Trixie has slipped from being at a 20 per cent price-earnings ratio pre- mium in the mid-1980s to being at a 15 per cent discount. A revival in small companies is eagerly awaited mainly because they are more focused on the UK economy and more likely to benfit from recovery. The trust awaits approval from the Securities and Invest- ments Board but, on launch, it plans to have a gross yield of 55 per cent. The initial charge will be 15 per cent Investors will be ofered a 18 per cent discount on launch day and a 1 per cent discount thereafter for the first three weeks; the annual charge is 1 per cent. The launch is aimed at last!i- tatous but small investors can telephone 0800-289505 for ularity is the revival of the split capital trust. Such trusts separate the functions of capi- tal growth and income, giving them the chance to appeal to a wider circle of investors. A high yielding income share in a split capital trust, placed in a PEP, is a very attractive option for an income-seeking investor. So has the argument finally shifted in favour of investment trusts? In terms of perfor- mance, there appears to be no contest. Over the last five years, Â£100 in the average investment trust would, with income reinvested, have turned into Â£173.80. The same amount invested in a unit trust would have risen to just Â£136.90. Over ten years, the differ- ence is even starker. A hun- dred pounds in an investment trust would have grown to Â£517.40 in that period; in a unit trust to just Â£387.40. But those figures could be rather misleading. Part of the reason for the strong perfor- mance of investment trusts is that the discount has narrowed in the 1980s. The discount is determined by the supply and demand for investment trust shares. In the mid-1970s, the private investor had been driven out of trusts by high taxation, and the investment institutions were left as unenthusiastic holders of trust shares; the discount was as wide as 40 per cent. The discount has narrowed through the 1980s, thanks partly to the trusts' efforts to attract private investors. The activities of predators have also been important; they have swooped on trusts whose assets appeared \"cheap\". That narrowing of the dis- count means that the share prices of investment trusts have risen faster than their asset values. That has given them an advantage over unit trusts, since unit prices rise and fall directly in line with the asset value of the fund. The average investment trust discount has now fallen to 13 per cent; so there is far less scope for the discount to narrow in the 1990s. Indeed, there is always a risk that the discount could widen again. This could easily happen if the industry, in its enthusiasm to launch new trusts, swamps private investor demand. Nevertheless, even if one strips out the discount factor, investment trusts have outper- formed unit trusts. In asset value terms, Â£100 in an invest- ment trust fund has grown to Â£431 over ten years; even on the most favourable offer-to-of- ser basis, Â£100 in a unit trust has only grown to Â£412. This relatively narrow lead expands to around 11 per cent if unit trusts are measured on an offer-to-bid basis. Three sac- tors may explain it. Charges on an investment trust tend to be lower, which in the long term should boost investor returns. Secondly, the ability of invest- ment trusts to borrow money (while having its dangers) means they can gear up to take advantage of rising markets. Thirdly in falling markets - notably the 1987 Crash - unit trust managers face the prob- lem of redemptions, and have to sell shares at distressed prices. Investment trust man- agers are saved this dilemma. The traditional argument is that unit trusts are better for the small investor, because of the discount factor. That is probably too facile. It seems unlikely that the discount will ever widen back to its 1970s levels, or even the 25 per cent or so of the mid-1980s. The risk is fairly limited, especially if the investor is buying a hold- ing for the long term. On the other hand, the liquidity of unit trusts is an important factor. On Page V, Kevin Goldstein-Jackson describes his problems in sell- ing his holding in a small investment trust. With a unit trust, all you do is pick up the phone. That problem would not occur with a large trust such as Foreign & Colonial. Never- theless, the guiding line for investors is probably that if performance is the most impor- tant factor, investment trusts have the edge; but if liquidity is vital, they should opt for unit trusts.

   "text_content" : "N OW THAT Scottish Mutual Assurance has accepted the embrace of the Abbey National, what will be the effect on the life company's policyholders? Scottish Mutual is one of more than 20 British mutual life insurers - companies which are owned by their policyholders. To become part of the Abbey National empire, the small Glasgow-based com- pany will need to sacrifice its mutual status. Over the next few months policyholders will be asked to sell their interest in the com- pany to Abbey National. Only 300,000 policyholders are affected but many of Britain's smaller mutuals find them- selves in a similar condition to Scottish Mutual and other so-called \"demutualisations\" could follow. Scottish Mutual's board is convinced of the merits of the deal which they believe will help them increase their share of the life insurance market and open new opportunities for the company's 1,000 staff. Policyholders may have a number of questions. We try to answer some of them here: What rights do I have? Holders of with-profits policies - that is about 175,000 of the company's 300,000 policy- holders - are eligible to vote. Seventy-five per cent or more of these voting members will need to vote in favour of the deal if it is to be approved. When will this vote occur? At a special general meeting - in early November. What benefit will I get if the Stakeover goes throught The benefits of the takeover are confined to the owners of Scottish Mutual - the same 175,000 with-profits policy- holders eligible to vote. Abbey proposes to pay Â£285m to acquire the group. About a quarter of this money - some Â£70m - will be directed towards the payment of a spe- cial bonus to policyholders. Scottish Mutual will circu- late individual with-profits policyholders with details of how they will be affected in the next few days. The average benefit per poli- cyholder will amount to about Â£400 - although the benefit an individual will derive from the one-off bonus will depend on how long they have been policyholders and how much money they have invested. Policyholders will receive the benefit of the remaining Â£215m less directly. The money is to be invested in a new with- profits life insurance fund. The main benefit here is to secure the value of future bonuses - reversionary bonuses that are paid annually and terminal bonuses that are paid at the end of a policy. As part of a proprietary com- pany, Scottish Mutual will be obliged to pass on a percentage of annual surplus to the share- holders of Abbey each year. In mutual companies policy- holders receive 100 per cent of the value of any surpluses but, in proprietary companies, 90 per cent of the surplus is directed to policyholders and 10 per cent - in effect the profit - to shareholders. On the other hand, the Â£215m injection into the life fund will inevitably increase the ,amount of investment income accruing to the fund (which, like other life futnds, is invested in a mixture of gov- ernmentt bonds, property and shares). Analysts suggest this increased investment income will benefit policyholders, off- setting the amounts that Abbey will take from the fund to pay profits to shareholders. What if I have a unit-linked policy? Scottish Mutual's unit-linked policyholders neither gain nor lose from the deal in the short term. In the long term, they may gain if Abbey National's new life operation prospers. The more profits Abbey makes, the more money it will be able to invest in its life business. Abbey National and Scottish Mutual managers hope this will increase the scope for posi- tive returns for all policy- holders. Will my policy be safer or more risky after the merger? The impact for policyholders should be minimal In general, of course, unit-linked policy- holders take greater risk to gain greater returns than with- profits investors. However, the risks and rewards are not affected by whether the com- pany is mutually owned. Will the premium be affected? People have contracted to pay certain premiums for certain benefits and these contracts will remain in force. Richard Lapper"

   "text_content" : "A N ERA has ended with the news that Standard Life, the Scottish insurance company, is pulling out of the with-profits endowment mort- gage market. With-profits policies have been the \"safe\" alternative for home buyers taking out an endowment policy - and Stan- dard Life has led the field in terms of performance. From January, Standard Life is introducing Homeplan, a unitised house purchase prod- uct. House buyers opting for an endowment mortgage will be given the option of a unit- linked endowment or a uni- tised with-profits policy. Under a with-profits policy, a guaranteed sum is increased by bonuses (called reversion- ary) declared every year and by a further bonus (terminal) at the end of the policy. Once declared, a bonus cannot be withdrawn. This creates a smoothing effect that protects investors from events such as the 1987 crash. Under a unit-linked policy, your premiums buy units in a fund - and the value of your policy fluctuates in line with the value of the fund. Such pol- icies are generally perceived as more risky - while offering the chance for greater reward - than a with-profits product. A unitised with-profits policy is a hybrid. Your premiums still buy units, but the value of those units increases in line with non-reversible bonuses. From the perspective of insurance companies, unitised with-profits policies reduce the strain of taking on new busi- ness - as the bonuses build up more slowly than with a tradi- tional policy. They also seem easier to market, because the concept is simpler to explain. Scottish Amicable and Sun Life made similar moves to Standard Life earlier in the year and personal pensions are now sold on a unitised basis. Existing with-profits policy- holders might be concerned about this development. Stan- dard Life has so many policy- holders of this type it says it will have every incentive to produce good returns. Policyholders must suspect that if the insurance compa- nies no longer have to compete to win with-profits business, they will have no interest in treating such policyholders well. Their best efforts will shift to unit-linked business. This is a particular pity because surveys by Money Management, the FT's sister monthly magazine, have shown that with-profits poli- cies have outperformed unit- linked versions. A survey in the November issue is set to show traditional with-profits policies have outperformed the unitised with-profits policies over the past five years. Unit-linked policies admit- tedly have charging structures which are easier to under- stand. That apart, it seems once again that the financial services industry is set to change - although it is far from clear that the consumer stands to benefit. Philip Coggan",

   "text_content" : "ONE of us wants to lose our hard-earned money. Safety of capital is, for many, a paramount consideration. There are really four dangers to guard against: fraud, market risk, company collapse and inflation. Thankfully, rela- tively few UK investors lose their money through fraud; and they usually do so via spe- cial \"schemes\", devised by small companies and individu- als, which offer exciting returns. The best rule to follow to avoid fraud is that if an investment seems too good to be true, it probably is. Avoiding market risk is rather more difficult, as any investor who bought shares in September 1987 will have found to his cost. Save for a few spe- cialist funds, it is impossible to guarantee your capital via equity investment. There are two ways to avoid the impact of a company col- lapse. One is by spreading your investment with as many com- panies as possible. There is a limit to this process, however, since many institutions prom- ise higher returns for bigger investments. The second route is to invest purely in govern- ment-issued securities such as gilts or national savings certifi- cates. Finally, do not forget that you need to preserve the \"real\" as well as the nominal value of your capital. At 5 per cent inflation, prices double every 15 years, so a sum of Â£10,000 today will be worth just Â£5,000 in 2006. Few investments conquer all four safety hurdles but here are ten products which offer security in various forms. 1 Bank accounts BCCI depositors may laugh at the notion that bank accounts are safe. They are, however, up to a point. A compensation scheme covers 75 per cent of the value of sterling deposits up to a maximum of Â£20,000 (the maximum compensation is therefore Â£15,000). That said, it is virtually impossible to imag- ine the government allowing any of the big four banks (Bar- clays, Lloyds, Midland and National Westminster) to go under without being rescued. 2 Building society accounts The position of building soci- ety depositors is even safer than of those who invest with banks. Deposits in building society are covered up to 90 per cent of Â£20,000 (maximum com- pensation of Â£18,000). However, the movement is quick to res- cue its weaker brethren by merger and according to the Building Societies Association no depositor has lost money through the failure of a soci- ety, \"certainly since before the war and probably since the 19th century\". Of course, except in the rare cases of corporate collapse. both bank and building society accounts offer return of capital. If an investment seems too good to be true, it probably is, says Philip Coggan 3 Tessas A Tax Exempt Special Savings Account from a major bank or building society offers the same security as a conventional account, plus the bonus of tax-free income if held for five years. If you are going to hold long-term savings in a bank or building society, it is silly not to have a Tessa. 4 Guaranteed Income Bonds Another product that normally comes with deposit protection added, if issued by an insurance company. The Policyholders Protection Act guarantees to pay out 90 per cent of the sum invested, without limit. Guaranteed income bonds pay a set income for a set period of time; capital will be returned in full, although there is no protection against inflation. 5 Cash unit trusts These relatively new products allow the investor access to money market interest rates in a unit trust form. As with other unit trusts, they are covered by the investors' compensation scheme, which guarantees the first Â£30,000, plus 90 per cent of the next Â£20,000 (maximum compensation is thus Â£48,000). Unlike other unit trusts, however, they are unlikely to go down in value, because they are largely invested in deposits. Charges are also lower than on equity-based unit trusts. 6 Guaranteed equity funds These products offer investors participation in the equity markets, allied to protection against the loss of their capital. A current example is the ELSA from Allied Irish Bank, which promises the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index if held for five years, or 30 per cent, whichever is the higher. This protects the investor against market risk but the \"guarantee\" is only as good as the company that offers it. Any gain on ELSA will be taxed as income, not capital gains. 7 Fixed interest gilts When it comes to safety, government-issued securities cannot be beaten; the UK government will not go bust. Gilts are long term bonds issued by the government, and pay a fixed rate of interest. There is a market risk - prices of gilts normally fall when interest rate rise. In the past, fixed interest gilts have also been badly affected by inflation. 8 Fixed interest national savings National savings certificates offer fixed interest returns, in a slightly less flexible form than gilts - they have to be held for five years to pay their full rates. However, there is no market risk - the capital value cannot fall. Basic rate taxpayers should opt for the capital bond, which pays 11.5 per cent gross; higher rate r / payers should opt for the 36th issue, which pays 8.5 per cent tax-free. 9 Index-linked gilts These have a number of attractions to the safety-first investor. For a start, their redemption value is linked to the rate of inflation which means that, barring an economic revolution, their value cannot go down. They thus offer the security of government-backed paper, no market risk, and inflation protection. In addition, most of the return comes in the form of capital gain and is tax free. Their only real disadvantage is that they only pay a small (index-linked but taxable) income of 2 or 2.5 per cent. Currently, however, they offer a real (after inflation) return to redemption of 4 per cent. 10 Index-linked national savings Regular readers may know of my enthusiasm for this product, which pays 4.5 per cent over the rate of inflation tax-free if held for five years. Should the Retail Prices Index fall over a month, their value can drop accordingly; but the repayment value cannot fall over a 12-month period. They thus have no market risk, and have the security of government backing. The only disadvantages; they pay no income and the real returns are lower if the certificates are surrendered early. They will be more attractive then the 36th issue, if inflation is higher than 4 per cent over the next five years. They will do better than conventional gilts for higher rate taxpayers if inflation is above 1.2 per cent.",

   "text_content" : "W HEN IS a market not a mar- ket? When it is the London stock market\\ dealing in shares of some sdall compa- nies. Earlier this year, my \"portable pension plan\" bought some shares in Abtrust Scotland. I was attracted to this investment trust partly because one of its largest holdings is in Caird Group. Shares in Caird have risen rapidly this year, from 42p to more than 110p. In 1990, Abtrust Scotland acquired Wightman Holdings, which brought around Â£2m of assets, most in liquid form, to the company. Part of the consideration for this acquisition was satisfied by the issue of more than 7.5 m new shares in the company at 27.5p per share. As the highest price Abtrust Scotland have reached this year is 22p, I thought that whoever had acquired Abtrust Scotland shares for 27.5p might be rather disappointed and would be urging the company to improve its performance, and share price. After my experience with the collapsing share price of Gresham House Investment Trust (from 300p to 50p in five months) I became much more wary of trusts investing (like Abtrust Scotland) in unquoted companies. Perhaps the pension plan should sell its 25,000 shares in Abtrust Scotland? I contacted the broker-manager of my pension plan on August 21 and asked him to sell the Abtrust shares. The market maker was only prepared to buy 250 shares at a time, for 17p each - a deal worth just Â£42.50 before commission and other costs! I thought this was ridiculous. It had been easy enough to buy 25,000 Abtrust Scotland shares, and the company was capitalised at Â£6m, so it was not as if my proposed share sale would represent a large percentage of the company changing hands. My broker continued to check the dealing position of Abtrust Scotland - but there never seemed to be any buyers: not even at a reduced price, unless I sold them in parcels of 250 shares at a time. According to Abtrust Scotland's annual report it has two stockbrokers: Cazenove & Co and Campbell Neill & Co. Surely they ought to be able to organise a better market in the company's shares? I wrote to George Robb, chairman of Aberdeen Trust, the company which manages Abtrust Scotland in return for a management fee, of two per cent of the total gross assets of the company, together with \"approved expenses.\" Abtrust Scotland owns 3.8 per cent of Aberdeen Trust. In response to my query concerning lack of liquidity, Robb replied: \"The situation to which you refer is unfortunately all too common in the case of many smaller companies in the UK, particularly those like Abtrust Scotland where a minority of institutional shareholders own the vast majority of the shares and are long-term holders.\" \"It is also unfortunate that at the moment investment companies specialising in unquoted investment are unfashionable, resulting in a discount to asset value which makes the issue of further ordinary shares, and hence improvement in liquidity, very difficult. I am sure that in the fullness of time the fashion will change and a more realistic value put on such companies, but it is of course impossible to predict when this will happen.\" According to Robb, there is \"a very important reason for the company having a listing on the stock exchange, for without this it would not qualify for investment trust status, bringing with it freedom from internal capital gains tax.\" My broker phoned Robb and the price offered was 15p per share, against a supposed \"bid\" price in the market of 17p. As the shares, even at 17p, were supposedly standing at a discount of over 40 per cent to the company's net asset value, the offer was declined. What is puzzling is why the market makers do not quote a realistic price (and have this listed in the Financial Times) rather than only wanting to deal in small numbers of shares. If 15p is all anyone is prepared to pay for the shares, then surely that is the price that should be quoted, not 17-18p? Liquidity in small companies appears to be rapidly getting worse. For example, my pension plan already owns shares in the investment company British and American Film Holdings. My stockbroker tells me there is now \"no market making activity whatsoever\" in the shares. I first bought shares in the company in 1985, paying 183p per share, and have remained impressed by the company's chairman Sir John Woolf, who has consistently managed to outperform the FT All Share Index. According to the company's latest report, as at May 3 this year, the value of the company's investments and cash, excluding film rights, was equivalent to 864.9p per share. The film rights included films such as Oliver! and The Day of the Jackal. I asked my broker in June this year to see if he could acquire a further 500 shares in the company for my pension plan, as I had noticed from the Weekend FT that occasional deals had been done at around 575p-615p per share. On June 17, the pension plan's interest was placed on the broker-to-broker screen as a buyer of 500 shares at 620p. It took until July 17 before a deal could be done. Surely there must be a way of increasing liquidity in the shares of small companies - or at least making more people aware of who is prepared to buy or sell shares. It is a pity that legislation designed to \"protect\" the investor would prohibit an Exchange and Mart style page in the FT in which private investors could cut out the \"middle men\" (brokers and market makers) and advertise their share requirements to each other and deal direct, accepting - as adults - that they ought to take their own precautions against dealing with possible crooks.

   "text_content" : "FOLLOWING the demerger of Vodafone from Racal Electron- ics, the board made a substan- tial display of confidence with the purchase of almost Â£6.5m worth of Racal shares at prices between 47p and 51.5p. Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman and chief executive, sold Vodafone shares worth Â£5m, reinvesting Â£2.5m in Racal. The next morn- ing Williams Holdings announced an uninvited offer for the company, with the share price rising sharply on the news. Among the three directors purchasing shares in Rea Brothers, was Glen Moreno, a recently appointed director of the company and also presi- dent of Fidelity International, the overseas arm of the US investment group. We have seen several instances of direc- tor buying in small London merchant banks in recent weeks. Their profits are depressed because of write-offs for bad debts, and in many instances the banks have asset r values sharply above their share price. It is interesting to note that the 15 directors of British Aero- space in the last annual report held an average of 513 shares each. It is hard to find an instance where the directors of a quoted company own fewer shares, so the small recent pur- chases are encouraging. Sales in ASW, Radius and AB Electronics are worth not- ing, with all prices well off their high and following fur- ther substantial sales made recently.

   "text_content" : "T HE BULL market is proving slow to mature, in spite of aburst of bids. The underlying level of trade is not that of a healthy bull market and the position cannot be guaranteed to improve even if all the current bid rumours come to fruition. Last week saw a spurt in vol- ume as three big companies threw their hats in the ring to signal the reopening of the takeover season. Trade concen- trated, however, on the compa- nies concerned, their intended victims and a few other possi- ble bid targets such as Sears and Allied Lyons. The maverick in all this was Asda where turnover amounted to 15 per cent of total equity. Every man and his dog seemed to be selling as the shares fell by 32p to 70p, but there has to be a buyer somewhere. The shares should be kept under review in spite of the performance of the com- pany and its leaderless board. Otherwise there was little sign of a change in the leth- argy which has pervaded the market in recent months. This is strange considering it has been on a bull tack for the best part of a year, but a partial explanation can be garnered from activity levels. Rises outpace falls each week, but the number of stocks on the move amounts to less than 40 per cent of the total. This time last year 46 per cent were active, although not upwardly. Selection has been upper- most in the minds of fund man- agers with little attention being paid to smaller compa- nies. But this has provided just the right climate for big com- Charles Wyatt looks at activity levels in the stock market panies to reassess and, in some cases, act on takeovers. Bidders quietly buy all the stock they can, at the lowest prices possible, before making a move. With Beazer and Racal, camouflage was readily to hand in the shape of the flotations and this took volume analysts' eyes off the ball. They will have noticed that customer trade in Beazer shot up to three times its average a couple of weeks earlier, and that both customer and intra market trade in Racal was building steadily. Most would have put these anomalies down to pre-flotation tactics. And all would have been fooled by Hawker Siddeley where vol- ume moves in inverse propor- tion to the scale of bid rumours... until BTR made its move. Perhaps they will get it right with Cadbury Schweppes which has been a bid perennial since 1987 when General Cin- ema of the US bought around 10 per cent in a dawn raid less than a month after the Crash. The holding has since been dis- persed so the stakebuilder responsible for the latest vol- ume anomaly must be sought elsewhere. Philip Morris, of the US, has been mentioned as a possible contender but \"when\"? is more interesting to investors than \"who\". As our chart shows there has been exceptional activity in the stock in recent weeks with heavy intra-market trade - see bar chart - overlaying weekly customer volume which previously averaged only 4.3m shares. The share price bottomed at the end of June and then swiftly adjusted to a trading range about 30 points higher. Cumulative volume took a lit- tle time to catch up, but then outpaced the price trend in rec- ognition of the growth in buy- ing volume, before settling back to await the interims. These results were better than expected and halted profit tak- ers in their tracks. Attention is now focused on whether or not stakebuilding took place in the week ending August 23 when both customer and intra-market trade rock- eted. At the same time, how- ever, the price fell slightly and this is unusual as high volume tends to accelerate price move- ments in either direction. The likelihood is that market makers did a good job in accu- mulating stock for an aggres- sive buyer. This could have left market makers a bit short of stock, hence the rise in price the following week. This makes Cadbury shares an interesting bet. No bid speculation sur- rounds British Land. In fact the property sector has only just been superseded as the least favoured sector of the market after a run of five months. The cuts in interest are obviously expected to take time to filter through the sys- tem, but British Land seems to be gaining credence as a swift case for recovery. The first hint that knowl- edgeable investors were reas- sessing the company came at the beginning of August when the price rose on a burst of volume. More important, cumulative volume, which is a measure of investor enthusi- British Land Share price (p) Volume (m shba) 330 20 320 Share price 15 310 Cumulative10 300 volume 290 5 280 270 260 -5 May 1991 Sep 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 May 1991 Sep Daily turnover (millions) Cadbury Schweppes Share price (p) Volume (m shares) q4Z 400 380 360 3A40 May 1991 Sep 15 10 5 0 -5 20 May 1991 Sep Daily turnover (milons) asm derived from the net increase/decrease in purchases of stock, moved significantly closer to the price trend.

Consis- tently higher volume would suit British Land shares - as well as the rest of the market. Charles Wyatt runs the com- pany Volume Analysis",

   "text_content" : "RITAIN'S 2m expatri- ates seem to receive scant attention when the UK's taxing stat- utes are formulated. The rules relating to pen- sions are a case in point. Pre- sumably, no-one would dis- agree that an individual's desire to provide himself with a pension in retirement is a praiseworthy aspiration, deserving encouragement. Try telling that to an expa- triate. If you choose to spend your working life in Singapore rather than Southampton, there is precious little incen- tive to save for a pension under UK tax law. Should you be seconded overseas by your employer, the Superannuation Funds Office of the Inland Rev- enue may permit you to remain a member of the UK scheme for up to 3 or 10 years, provided that there is a defi- nite expectation of a return to the UK. If your overseas employer has a scheme of his own, you may be entitled to become a member but, if the scheme is not UK approved, you should take great care in relation to any lump sum benefits after your UK residence resumes. The law does not recognise expatriate personal pension plans at all. Even if you were a member of such a plan before your departure overseas, your contributions will have to cease - for the reason that your maximum contribution is between 20 per cent and 40 per cent (according to age) of your \"net relevant earnings\". Since these words, broadly speaking, encompass purely UK taxable earnings, the.figure for most expatriates will be nil. The advantages of a UK approved pension scheme are tax relief for the contributions paid and total exemption of the fund itself. The quid pro quo is, of course, liability on the pen- sion when it is paid. Obviously, since expatriates pay no UK tax on their sala- ries, they would not expect relief in respect of their savings for retirement. But the absence of exemption on these accumulations can cause them considerable problems. While they remain non-resident, all is well, since by investing over- seas all UK tax is avoided. Thereafter, full income and capital gains tax liability applies - which is particularly disadvantageous for those who have a further period of employment in the UK before retirement and when tax rates are high. To add insult to injury, the income generated by such savings has always been treated as \"unearned\" whenever an investment income surcharge applies. Labour is committed to rein- troduce a surcharge, if elected. It is not without significance that, following the recent Inland Revenue crackdown on offshore portfolio bonds, many cries of \"foul\" came from for- mer expatriates who were using them as do-it-yourself pension plans. Happily for those Britons who work abroad, the UK and its offshore islands have a highly innovative financial ser- vices sector which has done all it can to fill the pensions gap in the total absence of any UK legislative framework. The result is a multiplicity of schemes, each with its own special features, falling, how- ever, into three main group- ings according to whether they are based on (1) ten year poli- cies, (2) single premium bonds or (3) Jersey Section 131C plans or the equivalent. The first group can provide tax free proceeds on maturity even if the policyholder is then a UK resident, although to achieve it, the overseas policy must be converted into a UK qualifying equivalent within one year of resuming residence there. Fragmentation of the policy allows one or more parts to be cashed yearly. By contrast, plans based on single premium investment bonds can only defer tax until the benefits are drawn. In tax terms, Jersey Section 131C policies - which are approved pension plans in the island but not in the UK - are similar to the single premium investment bond type. Most importantly, they have pro- vided the means by which expatriates may gain access to the with-profits funds of big UK insurers such as Clerical Medical & General and Nor- wich Union. The benefit for the would-be pensioner is that he can dele- gate investment decisions to the insurance company and sidestep the volatility of unit- linked funds. Bonuses, once attached to a policy, cannot then be removed. The best type of plan for you, and the best time to encash it, will depend upon your circumstances. But in the longer run, you might get a better deal by writing to your MP, if you have one, demand- ing a change in the law.

   "text_content" : "MY HOME IS terraced and the purpose-built access drive to all the garages for the terrace passes by the end of one house. The house and the garage are shown on the land registry documents and it is clear that the householders must gain vehicular access to their garages by means of the drive. The residents of the house abutting the drive are obstrep- erous, and have recently had a satellite dish installed on the wall of their home which juts into the space above the access drive. The terrace and garages are a purpose built develop- ment and the registry show that this property ends at the wall from which the dish pro- jects. Are the owners of the house by the drive entitled to obstruct the communal access in this way? * The owners of the house which abuts on the driveway are not entitled to obstruct it, whether by means of a satellite dish or otherwise. It is a ques- tion of fact whether the dish makes it materially more diffi- cult for vehicles to negotiate the drive: if it does not there is not such an obstruction as to amount to an interference with your rights of way over the drive. The owner of the drive is in a stronger position, as he can insist on the removal of anything trespassing in the air space above his driveway, how- ever slight the infringement. On course for a capital gain IN 1982 I bought a share in a golf club in Spain so that my wife and I could become playing members when on hol- iday. We have each paid the annual subscription from 1982 until 1989 when I wrote to the club handing in our resigna- tions and ofafering the share in the club for sale. The share had appreciated in value and its sale realised a gain in excess of the Capital Gains Tax Allowance for the current year. Am I liable to pay CGT on this? I would have thought t not since the purchase of the share was a reqirement before we could join the club and was not an investment. * Capital gains tax extends in principle to disposals of all types of asset, as defined in section 19(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979: \"All forms of property shall be assets for the purpose of this Act, whether situated in the United Kingdom or not, including: a) option, debts and incorpo- real property generally; and b) any currency other than sterling and c) any form of property created by the person disposing of it, or otherwise coming to be owned without being acquired.\" Q&A No legal responslbility can be accepted by the Financial Times lor the answers given in these columns. All inquirles will be answered by post as soon as possible. A free introductory pam- phlet to capital gains tax (CGT14) is obtainable from your tax office. If you had given us the pre- cise dates of purchase and sale, that might have enabled us to give a more helpful reply (including the indexation per- centage). If the purchase was before the end of 1981-82 the value of the shareholding at March 31 1982 will be relevant. Depositor protection YOU HAVE indicated that only building society investments up to Â£20,000 qualify for (par- tial?) reimbursement if a soci- ety ceases to trade. My wife has an investment account with a society with which I also have two invest- ment accounts. Does the Â£20,000 limit applies to each account, to each investor or to spouses jointly. What is the corresponding amount and ruling for bank deposit accounts in joint names? * The limit applies to each investor. The protection is only in respect of 90 per cent of the deposit (s) with a limit on the deposits of Â£20,000. Bank deposit protection is for 75 per cent of deposit(s) with the same ceiling of Â£20,000 on the total deposits.",

   "text_content" : "Garry Booth talks to Jon Dabner about running a jazz venue Persuading the poseurs to drink: Jon Dabner, owner of the Jazz Cats, where the audience is spending less on refreshments \"I'VE become an accountant. I didn't enlist for this.\" Jon Dab- ner, proprietor of London's most chic jazz club, the Jazz Cafe waves his arms around above his head. \"Air condition- ing is so expensive. Is this air conditioning on?\" he asks no- one in particular. He tries to find a comfortable position on an unyielding stainless steel bar stool: \"We should never have bought this furniture. Bloody waste of money.\" F orty-four year old Dab- ner, one time school- teacher and adventure playground overseer, is having a Mexican beer in the Dudu Pukwana bar and reflecting on the problems of establishing and running an upbeat jazz club in a downbeat economy. He pays Â£100,000 a year rent (plus Â£12,000 a year to a neighbour to run his fire escape over his roof) and, nine months in, owes Â£500,000 to the contractors and suppliers who fitted it out. He had budgeted Â£250,000 for the tasteful if stark post-modernist decor and it cost three times the amount. Now he spends more time than he would like crunching numbers and soothing suppli- ers. He is performing the sinan- cial equivalent of circular breathing. So far he has man- aged to negotiate a deal with his contractor creditors to pay off an agreed amount per week into a central fund which is then shared out among them. \"They were very enthusiastic when we started and put in a lot of work . . .the dumb waiter has never worked, mind you.\" Dabner arrived on the jazz scene relatively recently. He made his mark with the origi- nal Jazz Cafe, in his home neighbourhood of Stoke New- ington - a cosmopolitan quar- ter of north east London also inhabited by bedsit dwellers, media employed bohemians, Goths with dogs on string and lots of musicians. He established the club in 1987 with a Â£50,000 loan, Â£25,000 from the proceeds of re-mort- gaging his house and Â£25,000 from four partners. It was tiny, a bar and bandstand being pressed into an old shop front, but it was consistently packed for the three years of its exis- tence. The jazz scene was booming, so was the club. He even had a mini summer festi- val, the Seen on the Green, and had made albums from live recordings taken in the club. Dabner was soon looking for ways of expanding. He did not want to move out of Stoke Newington and sought permis- sion from English Heritage to extend sideways into the three historically interesting shop- fronts it owns. Able to raise finance from the Borough of Islington but unable to per- suade English Heritage that his conversion would not destroy their 17th century architecture, he moved on. Barclays had deserted an imposing building on another corner of Newington Green and was asking for offers of not less than Â£250,000. In the property boom of '89 it went to a developer for Â£650,000 and now stands as more or less empty office units. \"My personal crusade ended there,\" says Dabner \"I stopped being a Stoke Newington lib- eral. . . and tried Islington.\" He waited nearly a year for planning permission to be granted on Imry Merchant's ideas for Islington Green where he hoped to return the disused Collins music hall to some- thing approaching its former glory. Planning permission has not yet been granted. Then at the end of 1989 he saw another Barclays Bank building for sale, this time in the centre of Camden. A north mecca for the hipsters, home to a wealthier bohemian frater- nity than Stoke Newington and on the tube, Camden proved impossible to pass over. Whitbread, the brewer, put in Â£250,000 at a preferential loan rate which depends on barrelage, the Newington Green club raised Â£100,000 and his house, Â£40,000. Membership schemes added Â£70,000 (the vanguard membership scheme which offered member plus guest one year's entrance for Â£150 proved so attractive it was stopped at 250 people and now costs Â£450). Originally scheduled to open in September 1990, Camden's Jazz Cafe eventually opened in December to mixed reviews and a prosecution for operating without a license. \"We were contracted to the artists, we had to open,\" says Dabner. The jazzers welcomed a venue to rival Ronnie Scott's club for top shelf programming but resented the presence of poseurs who did not know their harmonics from their par- adiddle. The poseurs were attracted by a hi-tech gallery on which to preen but resented not being allowed to chat dur- ing concerts. Health & Safety officers were unhappy about the gallery design after a mem- ber of the audience was crowned by bottles falling from the balcony. Dabner's eclectic program- ming has kept most people sweet, however, with two sets a night from the famous (Joe Zawinul and Jackie Maclean, for example) and the unusual (the Cypriot Festival of Medi- terranean Music). But maintaining a fast mov- ing programme and a large and shiny jazz venue in the deepen- ing gloom of recession has been harder than Dabner could have envisaged, even with a membership base of 1,000 plus. \"In recession, people don't spend so much. We had the attendance figures right, we had overestimated how much people eat and drink in a slump. You'd think they'd drink more wouldn't you?\" In these conditions, booking expensive top-line jazz artists can be risky for a club with a capacity crowd of 350. One famous pianist cost him Â£12,000 for six nights: \"But with a turnover of Â£50,000 over that week, that's good business,\" says Dabner. Others have extras that test Dabner's bud- get and administrative powers, like the US super group whose members demanded \"junior studios\" in Mayfair at Â£1,000 per week rent in their contract. \"That's why I've had to move away from what I enjoy. Instead of getting involved in the music, I manage. I do the books and I negotiate,\" he says. And can his solo improvi- sation last until people can afford to stand more than one round of drinks? \"Put it this way, I wouldn't mind calling it the Sony Jazz Cafe or the Perrier Jazz Cafe if that's what it takes to secure its future.\"",

   "text_content" : "Roy Hodson on life after Fleet Street Street? The national newspapers, pulled the plug on the ancient street of ink a few years ago by fleeing to scat- tered locations, shedding the old printing methods on the way. Although The Times and The Sunday Times were not, geographically speaking in Fleet Street their move from Grays Inn Road to Wapping provoked and hastened the process of diaspora. As Fleet Street drained away, a number of journalists from those two papers found themselves floundering with- out jobs. Accustomed to report- ing and pontificating upon the affairs of big business a few of them saw a future in banding together to run a small busi- ness of their own. Six years later, as members of a thriving cooperative called Professional Writers, they report that a skilled writer can, indeed live by the pen. But harsh experience has taught them meantime that writing is one of the most difficult of all products to market. They have had to be prepared to tackle everything that has come their way, from weighty company histories to a brochure for a football club. Two former Sunday Times men, Stephen Aris and Berry Ritchie, were in their mid-for- ties with families and mort- gages when they found them- selves without staff jobs for the first time in their working lives. They decided to tackle the situation as one of the busi- ness problems they were so accustomed to writing about. If there was a market for writing, they reasoned, then they were in a position to har- ness the professional expertise of some of the best national journalists who, like them, had left staff jobs and were trying, with mixed success, to \"go it alone\" as freelances. Aris and Ritchie noticed that photographers were used to selling their work through agencies, while writers, by and large, were strangers to the system. So they set up Profes- sional Writers on the same lines as a photographic agency - finding writing commissions in the business world, selecting writers to carry out the work, and paying for the agency by taking a percentage. Since then several hundred company reports, chairmens' speeches, company histories, brochures, and other pieces of assorted writing, have been coaxed from the word proces- sors of the Professional Writ- ers' team. About a dozen writers, all working from their homes, make up the Professional Writ- ers stable. Numbers fluctuate as people are lured back into staff jobs or disappear overseas on long assignments. Current members include Michael Leapman, William 'Most companies find they have more explaining to do' Kay, Jonathan Hunt, Nicholas Faith, Richard Lander and Dominic Hobson. Unlike all the others, who were raised in journalism, Hobson is the first of a new breed for Professional Writers. He is a former mer- chant banker who has turned to writing. Aris and Ritchie, whose main fixed overheads are a renting a small office and pay- ing a marketing manager, responded to the warning bells of recession last year by, as Aris puts it, \"making a tight ship even tighter\". Overheads, never big, were cut to a mini- mum except in marketing. This year is exceeding their expectations, however, and will be their best yet, with turnover likely to be between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000 against the Â£180,000 they had forecast. Turnover was Â£33,000 in the start-up year 1985-6. It has risen steadily every year. Trying to analyse their suc- cess during recession Aris believes it is because they have clung to their core business of writing company reports. He says, \"Companies have econ- omised on design and public relations, and advertising, but there is still a need to write and produce a decent annual report. Indeed, most companies find they have more explaining to do. They are giving more thought to telling the world why they have got where they are\". Professional Writers bases its business on a standard charge to companies of Â£600 a day, or Â£75 an hour. It makes a net profit before tax for its two owners of up to 20 per cent. The delicate end of the busi- ness - indeed, the one that keeps Aris as business man- ager busy for hours a day, is fixing fees and working arrangements with his writers which will satisfy them while keeping the agency afloat. The actual fees negotiated with individuals are very private affairs indeed, both to protect writers' reputations and to pro- tect the agency from having its stars poached. A second life-line for Profes- sional Writers during the recession has been the high percentage of repeat business they have won. In the last year more than 60 per cent of their work has been from clients who have used the service pre- viously. This year they have written the annual report for 3M in Britain and have followed that with an employee report for the group and a brochure about a quality programme. They have begun writing the copy for the London Stock Exchange News on a regular basis with Richard Lander as the contributing editor. Ritchie, meanwhile, has been deep in the archives of the brewers Whitbread for the last six months writing a history of the company to celebrate its 250th anniversary. Other writers have turned in annual reports for Visa, Pearl Assurance, Land Securities, and Costain, while Aris has completed a descriptive bro- chure for Arsenal Football Club inviting fans to subscribe Â£1,000 a head for named seats in its planned Â£22.5m stand. * Professional Writers. 32 Fitzroy Square, London WIP 5HH, 071-388-1675",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1991-09-28",
   "paper_dc_title" : "The Financial Times",
   "text_content" : "year when there should be a glut of tomatoes ripened on the vine and tasting of sun. Just the job for stuffing paun- chily, slicing into salads, sim- mering to pulpy sauces, and so on. But what chance has the British shopper of finding any- thing approximating the real thing? I am sick of tomatoes that are tomatoes only in name. The Dutch, our major suppli- ers, seem to have an uncanny knack for breeding out all the flavour. The British are obsessed by uniformity of looks and to hell with the taste. An Israeli producer once told me that he grew all his crops in duplicate, one lot for home consumption and a sec- ond watered-down version developed for British buyers. No wonder European countries feel free to fob us off with their seconds. Are our palates really as indiscriminate, as unsubtle as they think? Do we really care so little about taste? A few years ago I rejoiced at the arrival of plum tomatoes in Britain. Those first imports were few and far between. And pricy. But they were the real thing. Now plum tomatoes are widely stocked and much cheaper - but far less desir- able. For today's offerings are only soi-disant plum tomatoes, often woolly textured and lack- lustre in flavour, but oh so neatly shaped. Having tested the market with the real thing, who decides, and why, that an infe- rior product will do for us? The saddest tomato I have eaten this year was a monster created by Sainsbury, the supermarket chain. A cross between a tomato and a pepper and lacking the virtues of either, the company deems it \"perfect for stuffing\". I weep to think of the time, money and effort spent in developing it. An inkling that food is a matter of concern for the taste- buds arrived in some shops this summer with boxes of tomatoes marked \"grown for flavour\". Food grown for fla- vour for the British market? Well I never. These \"new\" tomatoes are better (or should I say less awful) than the gen- eral run, but they are still a pale imitation of what the gar- dener can grow at home. From moans to good tidings - at least for those who live near Egham, Surrey. Food writer Anna Del Conte, who probably knows and minds more about good tomatoes than most of us, took me recently to a pick-your-own nursery there. Called The Green Landscape, in Hurst Lane, it is run by two Sicdan brothers and sells tomatoes as they should be - richly fla- voured, firm and ripe, not dull and mushy; fleshy, not cotton- woolly or awash with seeds; Juicy, not watery.

   "text_content" : "HOW TO SPEND IT T Â·- Legging it in the fashion stakes Buy yourself an early Christi stocking, says Sasha Jensei ONCE UPON a time there were stock- ings, then there were tights and now we have leg- gings. Anybody who does not own a pair of leggings is likely to feel out of it this winter. Most women can wear leg- gings so long as they are the right colour and the wearer has confidence. Apart from the fact that leggings can go hap- pily to any occasion, from disco to dinner party, the latest designs have made it possible to \"dress up\" or \"dress down\". The new embroidered range from Pineapple, for example, reveals a startling leap towards \"designer\" leggings. Who would have thought that Pine- apple would be selling tights at Â£100 a pair? The justification for that kind of price tag is to be found in the patterns and colours that Pineapple has used. Those with not-so-slim stomachs might like to know that there are now high-waisted embroi- dered leggings which come to below the bust and provide some control for the flesh beneath. As many a fashionable woman discovered last winter, with Wolford Opaque Tights (Â£19.95) you can pick your mood - wear them as tights one day, leggings the next. The cut is just like an ordinary leg- ging or tight, but it has a unique shine and a seam that runs down the back. The den- sity of the fabric means that legs never feel too bare. This allows you to wear them any- where, from the dinner-party to the cinema. They can be worn many ways - as tights topped by a skirt or, if you are youthful, as leggings with an all-in-one-body over the top. For more conservative tastes, there are the ranges from Nichole Farhi and Joseph. Both specialise in \"rib- knit\" and \"double-overlock\" wool leggings, (Â£59 and Â£89). All this means is beautiful pat- terns in thick warm winter material - the overall effect is some way between trousers and leggings. This look is not for everybody - try them in front of a mirror as the thick- ness of the wool can add inches to the legs. They come in creams, greys and blacks and are suitable for work or a day at the shops. A weighty jumper can be thrown over the top, slip on a pair of lofas and you have a complete outfit. Joseph has produced a selec- tion of co-ordinated jum the same patterns and but in varying weighi thick polo necks t( V-necks (from Â£135). Nichole Farhi also ha ers that work with its 1 - the \"raglan sleeve\" has a thick seam runnii the neck to undernei arm, or the \"slash which looks like it sow Both are loose-fittini ers that fall to the tol leg discreetly disguisi unwanted lumps or Prices start at Â£75. Th( and impecunious, for this kind of look is mosi are usually the very or cannot afford Farhi or prices. They might look in two of the shops that at off the mark at getti inexpensive versions prevailing look. Henn instance, has some e) and inexpensive version ribbed tights and tor matching sweaters and to wear over them. Hobbs has an inte variation on the legging which it calls \"jop- pers\" (Â£46). What is different about the jopper is that it is wide at the thigh but tight from the knee down. When on it fits closely but the heavy lycra material maxes it seem almost like a more ele- gant, tailored version of the legging. This increases the combination of clothes you can wear with it. Those who are new to leg- gings may be wondering what on earth they should put on their feet. Trial and error, mix- ing and matching will give you the answer but on the whole the small ankle boot is by far the most flattering accomplice. From flat heels which suit the longer leg, or bigger heels that accommodate the larger leg, there is a choice for all. The reader who cares about legs should look out for the name Hue - an American company that has just recently arrived in the UK and seems to have found a myriad ways of dressing the legs. Styles include the \"floral- lace\" legging (Â£34.50), which is a \"Victorian-inspired\" pattern in a thin lycra material, to thick sueded leggings, (Â£32.50). These are sophisticated styles that look much like brushed suede - nicest in brown or charcoal. But the most innova- tive designs are the \"bell-bot- tom\" leggings (Â£11.95) made from a fine nylon fabric - they look much like any other until they reach the ankle and flare out, Pierrot-like. These can be worn during the day or in the evening with either a jumper or jacket. Lastly, there are the \"baroque scroll\" leggings - yet another option for the addict. One should wear these in the evening because of the stunning, velvet-print design. Look out for Hue in Fenwick of New Bond Street, Harrods and House of Fraser shops. Where, then, is the dividing line between tights, leggings and joppers? It is hard to say. The definitions are blurred. Ski-pant leggings, always more functional than fashionable, seem to be on the way out. You can still get away with last year's plainer styles but this season's are showing much more variety of colour and tex- ture. In whatever shape or form suits you best, leggings are the most essential piece of clothing for the wardrobe at any time in the year. Be daring, be flam- boyant. These embroidered lace leggings In Ivory or black are avail- able at Â£34.50 from Fenwick",

   "text_content" : "SHOPPING for Christ- mas gifts for friends and family abroad usu- ally means combing the stores for something small, lightweight and inexpensive. Postal charges can double the price of a present and there is always the fear that it might end up in Katmandu, rather than Canada. Interflora is an option, but you can send flowers only so often. And Harrods' hampers might not be compatible with your bank balance. So why not shop abroad in the first place? You can do so from home so long as you have a credit card - Mastercard and Visa are most commonly accepted - and do a bit of pre- planning. Mail order shopping is increasingly popular, particu- larly in North America. But finding a gift delivery service in the country of your choice can be hard work. Museums and art galleries are a good place to start, if you are famil- iar with the country, as many offer gift delivery services for a high quality range of gifts. Leading department stores are also a good bet. You can obtain addresses and phone numbers from the relevant high com- mission or embassy. The list below gives an idea of what is on offer. You can write or fax to order a copy of company brochures - most are free. You can also tele- phone, but time differences, bad lines and bureaucracy can make it a frustrating and costly call. Remember that delivery charges will increase the price of your chosen gift, and allow plenty of time for receiving the catalogue and then delivering the gift. If you do not have a credit card, some companies will take local cur- rency money orders or cheques. Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario, Can- ada, M5S 9Z9.

   "text_content" : "Private Passions: Hang-gliding may not be everyone's idea of relaxation but for Richard Gourlay and Bernard Clifford it's like walking on air ,a -..A -d 0 \"Once you have tested flight you will walk the world with your eyes turned skyward.\" - Leonardo da Vinci, renaissance man and aviator-manque. ON A crisp Swiss morning, I clipped into my hang glider and slipped off an Alpine slope below the Diablerets glacier into silky smooth air. As I wasted above the resort town of Villars the breathless early morning calm made the act of flying as natural as riding a bicycle. Putting on some speed and banking, I listened to the wind increase through tense rigging as I crossed the valley to inspect some cows grazing beside a secluded chalet. Thirty minutes and 4,000 feet later, after a forlorn attempt to find rising air above a disused quarry, I set my glider down in a field of stubble, elated and deeply satisfied. Not exactly a Boys' Own tale of derring do. But in the absence of thermal conditions - hang-gliding's equivalent of fresh powder to the skier - it is the kind of flight that all but the most hardened competitive pilot might consider memorable recreational flying. As a sport hang-gliding is rarely associated with serene, incident-free flight. For this, perhaps, we have Icarus to blame. Faced with the chance to leave terra firma, many people recoil in horror, blinded by a vision of tumbling earthwards with some modern variant of singed wax wings. But the sport is much safer than 20 years ago when some Californians modified the flex-wing parachute, developed by Francis Rogallo for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and found a new way to stay high. New materials and a better understanding of how a wing works have banished for good the practice of jumping off hills on a wing and a prayer. As well as becoming safer, hang-gliding can also be considerably easier to learn. Most of the pilots registered with the British Hang Gliding Association, had to display a well-developed masochism even before getting more than a few feet off the ground. I learnt on hill sites where much of the day not spent carrying 50 Ibs of glider back up the hill involved removing the machine to another site because the wind had changed direction. Frustrated by this, and inspired by experiments in Texas, Rona and Tony Webb developed towing in the flat lands of Norfolk. Their method, adapted by a handful of other schools in the UK, has rescued dozens of students whose enthusiasm for flying was nearly destroyed by the rigours of learning on a hill. The system uses a car engine, an automatic transmission and a host of safety devices to tow the pilot, rather like the static launch of a sail-plane. The winch driver, guided by the instructor, can pull the novice to 10 feet - or the more experienced student to 700 feet - where the tow line is released. Candy Gourlay On tow: Richard Gourlay In the anxious minutes of take-off If the wind changes direction, you simply shift the position of the winch. Not only does this allow a student the luxury of wheeling the glider back to the take-off point, it is allowing far more women to come to a sport that has largely remained a male preserve because of the ardour of early training on hills. Once airborne, a glider is so balanced that strength is rarely a limitation - as Rona Webb has demonstrated, beating all but seven men and one other women in the BHGA cross-country league table. Most pilots who learn through towing return to hill-top launching. But towing - and even more so aero towing which is currently banned by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority - has produced some spectacular results, notably the 304-mile cross-country record flight by Larry Tudor from a ground launch in Texas. Normal mortals cannot expect this degree of success. But after a five-day course the novice can already float above the countryside and dream of going to cloudbase in a thermal. These elusive aerial escalators make wasting down a Swiss valley look positively pedestrian. They transform life in the country. No longer is a flock of swallows mere birds - they signal that a thermal has popped off a nearby field taking with it bugs on which the swallows are feeding. Fluffy clouds on an August morning become a signal to scramble to the tow field or hill as the thermals develop into cumulus clouds. Thermals, and their promise of eight-hour flights, lead to most apris-flight gossip, like the admission from one leading woman pilot that she wears a nappy when flying long distance. Hang-gliding, like golf, fishing and almost every sport, is relived at the equivalent of the 19th hole where in intoxicated flights of fancy tales are woven about the thermal that got away. It is in these watering holes that the old captains of the air can be found surrounded by glassy-eyed students, the veterans of Rogallo and Delta wing, survivors of collapsing wings and deployed safety parachutes. Not far below the surface is a tinge of nostalgia for the old days perhaps captured by the graffito on a T-shirt doing the circuit; \"Remember the days when hang-gliding was dangerous and sex was fun?\"",

   "text_content" : "Jancis Robinson doles out her own medals to the wine contests N off-licences and wine shops all over Britain, sales staff will be cursing the fiddly little bits of paper they have been sent from head office announcing to customers that this wine won a Silver Medal at the 1991 International Wine & Spirit Compe- tition while that one was Commended in the, quite distinct, 1991 International Wine Challenge. Do the stickers, neck labels and posters have any real signifi- cance for the wine drinker, or are wine competitions simply a public relations exercise for those who run and partici- pate in them? Those results in full: International Wine Challenge Run by Wine magazine, the lively monthly rival to Decanter, this is the newest but already the biggest wine competition based in Britain, wine's favoured neutral territory. This year 300 tasters between them judged 4,500 wines from around the world during a hectically bibulous week in May. Although about half the entries were French, the results just announced reveal a distinctly antipodean list. \"Red Wine of the Year,\" which has to be available in quantity and not too expensive as it is served at the prize-giving dinner, is Penfolds Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz (around Â£5 from Oddbins, Bottoms Up, Safeway and many more); its white counterpart an Entre-Deux-Mers made by an Australian-trained winemaker Ch Haut-Redon 1990 (about Â£4.50 from Thresher/Wine Rack); and the sparkling glory is shared by California, Australia and New Zealand. Points for: Genuinely international but neutral. Categories are designed to find the best Chardonnay entered (1989 iKumeu River and 1989 Elston, Te Mata) rather than which New Zealand f Chardonnays deserve medals. Only 1 about a quarter of the wines entered s (by British merchants) receive medals, e although another quarter are merely Commended, which allows their I retailers to garland them with stickers I and certificates advertising Wine t magazine. Points against: Organisation and e tasting conditions are enthusiastically s well-meant rather than technically perfect. Wines tasted from sometimes barely-disguised bottles in roasting bag overalls. Judges, drawn mainly from the trade, can find themselves hurtled from one category to the next in an atmosphere that more closely resembles a carnival than a y pontification. e This judge's award: Silver medal ' International Wine and ' Spirit Competition k Now in its 22nd year, the IWSC has had s to work hard to throw off its original t image, encapsulated in the headline tra- y ditionally used by the trade weekly Off- Licence News above its results: \"Every o One A Winner.\" o Now run more seriously by a group of e wine lovers and ex-traders, the competi- 8 tion is based in Ockley, Surrey at the a laboratory of Corkwise, a sister wine A analysis company of which IWSC is the a most important customer. a Points for: Not surprisingly, every 1 wine is technically analysed, which a throws up some interesting results g (such as, this year, that the use of a copper in vineyards and cellars seems to be increasing) but has little effect on 1 the competition other than the excla- D sion of obviously faulty or technically Sillegal entries (seven wines, less than 1 per cent, this year). Ever since wine trade gentleman Harry Waugh was roped in they have managed to recruit a top-flight name as annual president - Peter M F Sichel of New York this past year. Clinical tast- ing conditions from ready-poured glasses. Tastings spread sedately over 13 weeks. Points against: The entries from the world's wine giants France and Italy combined composed less than 10 per cent of this year's 1,066 entries which came mainly from the New World. Small wonder perhaps that South Africa (135 entries, one panel chair- man, two judges and two sponsored trophies) scooped the greatest number of golds. Medals magnanimously awarded to 58 per cent of entries in national categories, so that every one was a winner from Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Hungary, India, Israel and Yugoslavia. Award: Bronze Medal French Medailles d'Or Shiny gold circles stuck on to bottle necks that denote gold medals won at either the Paris or Macon Fairs really are worth something. Awarded by a panel of judges familiar with exactly what each appellation should taste like. Award Gold Medal Deutsches Weinsiegel The German Wine Seal is awarded by the DLG (don't ask) to top scorers in national comparisons, judged like French Medailles d'Or by regional experts. Bottles with a narrow gold or silver strip across the neck really are superior in my experience. Award: Gold Medal Australian gongs The Australians are the keenest judgers of wine in the world, doing at it state by state, sometimes tasting 200 wines a day. Their excuse, that the nascent wine industry needed guidelines, has long since worn thin, but the judges, technically-trained sniffer dogs, go on out-tasting the next fellow just the same. Many back labels on exported bottles list dozens of gongs, but beware the Show hierarchy; a Hobart Gold may warrant only a Bronze in Sydney or Canberra. Award: Silver Medal These awards are all very well but nec- essarily non-representative. The big problem for the consumer is that the producers and purveyors of the world's most sought-after wines are, under- standably, wary of exposing them to gladiatorial combat Nevertheless, the schemes outlined above provide useful signposts when searching out reliable, clearly-defined low-to-medium-priced wines but, what- ever the organisers say, subtle and slow-maturing wines are at a disadvan- tage, especially towards the end of the judging day.",

   "text_content" : "N August 1987 the Grand Hotel opened in the cen- tre of Berlin. It had taken two years to construct the traditional-style luxury hotel and a great deal of care had gone into creating east Ger- many's one real five-star hotel. Apart from a series of theme bars along Friedrichstrasse, the rooms and restaurants had to be paid for in hard currency. Here the occasional east Ger- man customer could expect a standard of luxury quite unheard of in the rest of his country. I say occasional for the majority of the clientele were businessman and diplo- mats from abroad. Two years later everything changed. First the Wall came down, then east and west merged. Since, the future of I I the Grand, and 34 other state- owned Inter Hotels in the east, has been uncertain. Their fate is in the hands of the Treu- hand organisation which is charged with the immense task of sorting out what belongs to whom after years of Commu- nist rule. The Treuhand's decision could come any day now, but until it does, east Berlin is marking time. Very little hasn changeIn the Grand, where the food was always excep- tional by eastern standards, there is a greater availability of certain foodstuffs such as lobster and Mediterranean fish which used to require large amounts of hard currency to purchase from the west. These days lobster, strawber- ries and aspaaguare even feely navaibe the former hoi po llo ewtios the Grand which hont on to Friedrichs- trsse. But in spite greater choice fr chefs Strobel and Ay, the place is still decidedly e-tern c .e Upstairs in the Silhouette estaurant the \"theme\" is the dinner dence; the Foruilenquin- tett next door is preoccupied with fish dishes with an accent on the Spreewald: it is all a little twee, a sort of gastro- nomic Disneyland in the mid- dle of the austere realities of life as it was (and still is) in east Berlin. A westerner may not open a restaurant in the east until the Treuhand has worked out what's what. In the old days there was only a small amount of private property under the Communists, but where that exists the owners are now free to use it as they wish. I asked a west German why more easterners had not availed themselves of the opportunity of making some money out of the increasing numbers of tourists who find their way to the city centre now the formalities have disap peared: They wouldn't have the nerve,\" she said.

Around the lower end of the Husemanstrasse and on Koll- witzplatz is a concentration of pretty bars and restaurants in a well-restored group of old Mietshauser. In the last days of the old regime, these were favourite bars for young pro- fessionals. The same clientele can be found today enjoying the summer evenings with a glass of beer, only occasionally visited by the bravest Italian or French tourist.

   "text_content" : "OWNING AND operating an aircraft is beyond the means of most of us. The basic, 40-hour private pilot's course costs at least Â£3,500 these days. An hour in a a light single-engined machine will cost between Â£55 and Â£100. When I was a boy Ijoined the Air Training Corps and learned to glide, then I joined gliding club and invested in a few hours of dual-control instruction on light aircraft. Many years later, when I was 55, I began to notice reports of something new on the horizon. I decided to take to the skies in a hang glider: a foot-launched assembly of Duralumin and Dacron. It seemed a very model of cunning simplicity, and I thought it could not possibly cost much. I was half right. However, this year, at the age of 63, I1 decided my old glider needed replacing. My new one cost Â£900 and it is wonderful. The uncertainties of British summers, meant that it was not until a year after my first five-day course on the Sussex Downs that I completed my instruction. The course included a straight running take-off (\"running\" means on your own legs); 180 degree turns while airborne; initiating and recovering from a gentle stall; and a stand-up landing, following 700 feet of novelty-packed descent. At first, flat-on-my-face landings usually outnumbered my stand-up landings - but they still counted as an \"arrival.\" Landing on long-suffering livestock did not count as a qualifying flight. When you are learning, the ratio of ground activity to flying seems frustratingly high. Safe air-familiarisation is learned by \"tethered flying\": each wingtip controlled and guided by a helper holding a few yards of line, enabling the glider to \"fly\" in the ridge breeze while remaining stationary. This allows the pupil, comfortably suspended in a harness hanging from the keel, to shift his or her body-weight forward and back and from side to side. The first modest free flight may be a mere hop. Nevertheless it is an act of faith which makes the pulse quicken. Strapped into the harness, you lean forward and run downhill, inching the bar out, feeling the \"lift\" build under the wing. Suddenly your feet are kicking at air and you are flying - emotionally as well as physically. You leave the ground at an acceptably slow speed, and the glider responds to the weight of your body transmitted through your hands \"on the bar\" (the base of the hang glider's triangular control frame). It is not exactly on a par with making vapour trails in the sky, but you run the same risk of addiction. Scanning the panorama of patchwork fields, toy-like trees and miniscule farm buildings, and riding the smooth flow of the ridge lift, you become part of a picture postcard. Above and around is an enormous sky. When it is time to step down into the scenery, your state of passive contemplation abruptly shifts. Sometimes it is the voice of your instructor - bellowed from the ground, or by radio, with the receiver attached uncomfortably close to your ear - which brings you back to earth. You become more aware of wind strength and direction. You check the wing level, the restraining comfort of the harness and mechanical assembly points. Is the ground ahead of you, on which you will run from your touch-down point while landing, clear of rabbit holes and obstacles? Is there another glider in the offing? Has the wind shifted a degree or so? For Â£275, I persuaded my instructor to sell me a hang glider weighing 50 lbs. You can de-rig them, roll them up and shrug them on to a car roof rack. Ten years or so ago an inevitable further innovation appeared: a strengthened hang glider frame with a rear-mounted lawn mower engine - in other words, the aeroplane, reinvented. But with engines come increased costs, more elaborate structural and rigging procedures, and the necessary strictures of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). At this point, \"flying\" stops being so pure or simple. B.C.",

   "text_content" : "SHOULD there be a sign saying \"Abandon hope all ye who enter here,\" I wondered, as I entered the Centro Linguistico Italiano Dante Alighieri on the first morning of my Italian course? There certainly seemed to be an infernal confusion inside. The school's director, Alberto Materassi, rescued me, explaining that it was always like this on the first day, and sent me into the garden to join dozens of other newcomers poring over their selection tests. The general air of friendly chaos belied the school's well-tried proce- dures. Founded in 1966, in 1990 nearly 1,600 people from 28 different coun- tries studied at the centre, housed in a 15th century palazzo near the Pon- tevecchio in the heart of Florence. On the basis of the written test and the interview which followed, each of us was allocated to one of the school's nine levels of competence, from begin- ners to those wishing to teach Italian as a foreign language. Our studies began in earnest on the second day. Conducted entirely in Italian, each day's session of four hours with only 15 minutes break, required considerable concentration. Classes at the Scuola are small - about 10 to 12 students in each - and there was little opportunity to day- dream. The teaching method at the Scuola is based on respect for the structure of the language. The teachers are graduates, mostly in political science, philosophy or languages, and the school trains them in its own aims and approach. My classes started at 9am. The first two hours were spent in the formal study of Italian grammar, although \"formal\" hardly describes the vitality and charm with which my teacher, Mivia, explained the vagaries of the Italian prepositions. The second half of the morning was devoted to conversation. Mivia quickly liberated us from the pedes- trian passages in our text-books and students took it in turn each day to select a topic and prepare an introduc- tion. We discussed, albeit haltingly, everything from magazine horoepopes to animal ;ights.8 Frequent howls of laughter coutVer- balanced the frustrt4ons of ig unable to express our ideas. 01i one occasion, all conversation stbpped entirely as we listened boen aperta to a Japanese lyric-soprano giving an informal concert to her fellow-stu- dents in the class next door. The days quickly found a pattern. I was amazed at how tired I felt at first and soon developed the habit of get- ting my homework out of the way as quickly as possible. After lunch, at the Scuola's noisy, cheerful (and very cheap) cafeteria, or a favourite local cafe, I returned to the school and spent an hour or so on the terrace getting to grips with my assignment for the day. Like many others, I fell in love with this spacious termso furnished with marble-topped tables and terracotta urns overflowig. with greenery. It commands one of the most beautiful views in Florence and is a delightful retreat, where students can work, read or talk. Language-learning is a great level- ler. In the comic confusion of trying to communicate in an unfamiliar tongue, inhibitions fall away and friendships flower. In a week, I felt more at home, both at the school and in my lodgings, than I had done after a year at an English university. Alberto and Gabriella Materassi are keenly-aware of the importance of creating a warm ambience for all their students, whether they are uni- versity graduates, insurance clerks, opera singers or bank presidents. \"They are all students to us,\" says Gabriella, who teaches the intensive one-to-one courses she pioneered at the school 22 years ago. \"And the bet- ter the experience, the better the learning of the language.\" Most of Gabriella's students are men, highly-established in their pro- sessions and accustomed to command, and they rarely find it easy to adapt to being students again. \"It requires a great deal of patience and the right psychological approach,\" says Gabriella. Brunmllechl's dome, one of the wonders o0 Florence P;i .Â·Â·Â·~.: .L% '~:Â·Â·': ~Â·.Â·r \"-( Â·;Â·Â·.::'' Â·Â·:-)7:\"Â·Â·Â·Â·3 The right accommodation also makes an enormous contribution to the quality of a student's experience. The Scuola is non-residential but will find a suitable hotel, pensione, apart- ment or host-family, depending on the student's inclination and pocket. Many young people opt for the free- dom of an apartment but living with a wieru ow re-muraW family is a unique opportunity to gain an insight into Florentine life and cul- ture, not to mention the advantages of total immersion in an Italian-speaking environment. The school could not have made a more fortunate choice for me. From the moment of my arrival at the immaculate, marble-floored apart- ment of the Sicuteri family, about 10 minutes' bus-ride from the centre of Florence, I felt as welcome and at ease as if I had been an old friend. Florella and Ferdinando Sicuteri have a love of their native city amounting to a passion. Fiorella cooks con amore. Over dinner each evening we dis- cussed everything Florentine from panzanella to the Pazzi Chapel, although we found that \"mmm!\" meant the same in any language. The Sicuteri family have been host- ing students for the CLI Dante Aligh- ieri for over 10 years but Gabriella Materassi admits that such families are not easy to find. \"We started off with friends of our own and they introduced other people. But it's the most difficult thing. It's not just a question of whether a house is clean and comfortable. It's whether the fam- ily can provide the right ambience to help students understand not only the language but the quality of Italian life.\" Living in an Italian home and resisting the temptation to lapse into English with fellow-students, I found that learning became a 24-hour pro- cess. I had arrived in Florence having learned all I knew by ear and the formal aspects of the Scuola's meth- ods gave me a much-needed grammat- ical base. Obviously, no language school is ideal for all students. The Scuola's strong grammatical bias may discon- cert people who are looking for a less- academic approach. But I have just conducted my first interview entirely in Italian. For me, there's no justifica- tion at all for abandoning hope. * Information: Centro Linguistico Ital- iano Dante Alighieri, Via dei Bardi 12 Florence.

   "text_content" : "ITH THE advent of 1992, language training for business is a rapidly growing market, reflected by a corresponding increase in providers of business language training. Jonathan Smith, a linguist with 14 years' industrial experience in European sales/ marketing, tells you how to look for the signs of quality pointing to language training organisations which know how to train effectively and deal in a businesslike manner with corporate clients. This is a checklist which a company training manager or individual language learner can apply: 1 Methodology. Do they use a modern, communicative approach which emphasises practical use of the language right from the beginning? 2 Materials. What course materials do they use - published ones, their own or (preferably) a combination of the most suitable materials for your requirements? Ask to see the language teaching materials they propose to use for your organisation. 3 Media. What use do they make of additional media to support their training programmes, eg audio, video, satellite. This is important to reinforce the training and add variety and interest. 4 Professionalism. What experience/qualifications do their language trainers have to teach? The single most important criterion is that they are effective teachers, fluent in the language, preferably with a UK or other EC degree in modem languages, an additional teaching qualification and an appropriate track record in training business people. 5 Training Needs Analysis. Will they examine your particular training needs in detail and design a programme to meet them? They should make you a written proposal detailing timing, aims, materials, evaluation procedures and costs. 6 Language Audit. If your organisation is large enough to have an existing, dormant foreign language capability, will they carry out a survey of existing skills? 7 Quality Control. Ask them about their QC mechanisms. How do they evaluate the trainer's performance, assess the progress of trainees and obtain customer feedback? 8 Track Record. Are they part of a reputable training organisation or member of a professional body? 9 Training Outcomes. What objective measurement do they have of the effectiveness of their training? Do they train to any nationally recognised qualification, eg RSA, Institute of Linguists, London Chamber of Commerce?. 10 Competence. Do they sound businesslike and market-oriented, without trying to blind you with hype and jargon?",

   "text_content" : "D AVID Feherty is most peo- ple's idea of a good man to have dinner with. He is bright, articulate, person- able and witty in a world full of peo- ple who are not. You would not want to be stuck at a bus stop with many of the professionals on tne European Tour. With Feherty you rather hope the bus will be late so you can relish the gossipy, humorous and entertain- ing nature of his conversation for a little longer. Among those men who play golf for a living in Europe, there are not many who have been both caddie and pro- sessional, who read Zen books and quote PG Wodehouse, listen to opera on a compact disc player and are members of the National Trust and admit that they relate strongly to the forlorn characters Woody Allen plays in films. \"Woody\", says Feherty with a rue- ful smile \"says things like: 'I saw hope running to the horizon with his arse on fire.' Now that's the sort of fellow I can understand.\" In south Carolina over last week Feherty was relaxed, at ease with himself and not noticeably on fire. He appeared to be enjoying his first Ryder Cup. Dozens of Irish supporters were there to encourage him and he could hardly walk five yards without hearing the familiar Irish tones and intonation calling out to him \"come on David, good luck, David,\" or \"well played David.\" On Kiawah Island's Ocean course, there came one of those one-liners that Feherty has made his trademark. \"This is the High Temple of Stress,\" he said, meaning the hoopla that sur- rounded the current Ryder Cup, which is by far the biggest ever seen in the US. Feherty is a good enough player to have won nearly Â£750,000 in prize- money alone in the past six years. Yet the way Feherty tells it, he would o- rather be doing almost anything else. to He makes it sound as though he's is selling shop soiled goods. He might be n- one of Europe's best but it is at doing o- a job he often doesn't like and some- at times hates. of \"Golf is a perversion for me,\" says in Feherty. \"I have to want to be where I )e know I am not going to enjoy it. My ;h over-riding ambition is to make n- enough money to be able to give up a playing golf. This business of players liking the pressure is a macho thing }r and I don't believe it when Jack Nick- ky laus says he loves the pressure. I tell o- you what, the next time you see Nick- id laus facing a six foot downhill putt ra that curls from left to right you tap re him on the shoulder and ask him how id he feels about it.\" te Feherty is not only a man you seek rs out to eat with at night. He is a man journalists home in on in search of a e- good quote. Here are some of his most w recent: At the US PGA championship is this year he was asked about the As length of the course, Crooked Stick: \"It's so long it's the only time I've had *k to take into account the curvature of h the earth in doing my yardages.\" [e At the same championship Feherty it said: \"if this course is 7,000 yards long *s then that's as the crow flies. I've Le walked 9,000 yards - and that's only it on the front nine.\" .d At the same championship an te American TV commentator said to 11 Feherty: \"You don't seem to have used your six iron much this week, e, David. Why is this?\" .s \"I used it last night to smash the c. fire alarm in my hotel room.\" At the Dunhill Cup in 1990 Feherty r- defeated England's Howard Clark at ,, the fourth hole of a play-off, thus n ensuring victory for Ireland. No sooner had Feherty played the win- o ning stroke than the man from BBC Radio was there at his side, micro- it phone at the ready. \"Were you ner- d vous David?\" asked the reporter. \"Do you want to see my under- wear?\" replied Feherty. \"David, you do realise this conver- ' sation is going out live on BBC Radio don't you?\" \"I know. Do you still want to see i my underwear?\" I Few subjects get Feherty's goat i more than that of golf course design. > He came off the Valderrama course at ) Sotogrande last year after competing i in the Volvo Masters and said: \"This r must have been the last act commit- ted by Walt Disney before he died.\" I Recently Feherty and his close * friend and mentor David Jones t formed their own company to design P golf courses, Handmade Designs. r Their courses, swears Feherty, will be playable by all standards of golfers and not just long, straight-hitting low i handicap amateurs. i When he played at St Mellion, the Jack Nicklaus-designed course in i Cornwall earlier this year, Feherty was asked what he thought of the course. \"We've been diddled,\" he said. I \"This wasn't designed by Jack Nick- laus. It was designed by Barbara\" [Nicklaus's wife]. After one practice round at the Ocean Course, Feherty was asked for his reaction to the course designed by Pete Dye, the American designer. \"It's not like something in Ireland or Scot- land, it's like something from Mars,\" he replied after barely a second's thought. \"Like a lot of modern courses victory won't always go to the guy who hits the ball best but to the one who takes all the rubbish.\" In practice on Thursday, Feherty and Torrance were taking all the rub- bish. They found themselves facing a razor sharp partnership in Bernhard Langer and Mark James and on the 17th, a 200-yard par three, the two Celts could do nothing but stand and applaud when Langer holed out with a six iron for an ace. Then when the format changed from four-ball to four- King of one-liners: David Feherty says \"golf Is a perversion for me\" some, Torrance and Feherty were up against it once again. Neither was quite at his best and this explains Gallacher's thinking in leaving them out of yesterday morning's foursomes. Feherty, then, is a singular man. He collects antique furniture and high powered cars. He lives in a converted 300-year-old watermill in Bangor, northern Ireland, his birthplace, and in Johannesburg, where his wife Car- oline comes from. He plays a good game of golf and talks one that is just as good. A few years ago he began to visit Alan Fine, an outstanding sports psy- chologist and Feherty's success since then has been striking. Typically he explains this in his own vivid way. \"Before I met Alan I was like a blind man looking for a black cat in a dark room.\"",

With a vast V8 engine of more than 300 horsepower and Goodyear tyres a foot wide, it was no more than I had expected. (If you had not guessed, she was a Chevrolet Corvette ZR-I, the best sports car ever made in the US). Two days later it was all over. I was home in my sensible diesel, happily obeying all the rules. And wondering why Corvette had seduced me into driving on deserted hill roads almost as though they were rally stages. A moment of madness, a never to be repeated mental -aberration? Of course. And then, last week, it hap- pened again in Carcassonne. This time the cause of my undoing was a Peugeot 106 TSI, a pert little gamine of a car, half the size of a Corvette, less than a third as powerful. We behaved ourselves until we reached the hills. Then it was down into second, get the 1.4 litre fuel-in- jected engine howling joyfully at 5,000 rpm-plus and the fat (well, plump) 60 series Pirellis biting into the coarse tarmac. The little Peugeot and I had a won- derful time on those roller-coaster roads, scuttling swiftly through hair- pin bends, missing stone parapets by inches as we shot the narrow bridges. It was exciting, but I never felt less than 100 per cent safe and in control Half an hour later, back on normal roads and driving at sensible speeds, it was all over. Uncharitably, I began finding fault. The ride, I deded, was hard to the point of being knobbly. The steering, so sharp in the hills, proved heavy in town and when parking. The black- roofed interior was too sombre. Earlier I had driven two other 106s, one with a 1,360cc, 75 horsepower engine, the other a 1,124 cc producing 60 horsepower. They are narrower tyred and less firmly suspended. Their ride and seating comfort, gen- eral handling and refinement were as good as I had anticipated when I inspected a couple of 106s in the unnatural surroundings of a London hotel some weeks ago. The 106 looks like a slightly scaled down Peugeot 205 with an even neater and larger windowed rear end. Peug- eot calls it \"a child highly desired by its parents.\" The styling similarities with 205 are admitted and justified by saying that such a basically good-looking car, \"like a decent cognac or calvados, doesn't deterio- rate with age.\" Prices will be announced in two weeks, just before London's Motorfair opens at Earls Court. I suspect they will be a little cheaper than those of comparable 205 models, but not very much. Four versions will be available, all doors, with petrol engines and 5-speed gearboxes. Five-doors will f low soon, diesels later and, eventu- ally, automatics. d Peugeot sees the 106 competing a with all kinds of small cars from Ford f Fiesta to Vauxhall Nova, Renault Cleo a to Rover Metro and, of course, the 205 s itself which will stay in production for several years. t In Britain, where the cheapest 205 i1 will be dropped, Peugeot recognises a that 106 will be bought instead of 206 p by \"empty nesters.\" But it expects 106 11 to persuade others to trade up from b more utilitarian cars such as the Fiat Panda. a We shall see. And what of its per- e haps most obvious rival, the Citroen Â£ AX? \"We are competitors with I Citroen though we are cousins,\" is the c official line. c The AX and 106 have individual structures but share many mechani- q cal bits and pieces. So, of course, do a other PSA (Peugeot-Citroin Group) b products like the Peugeot 405 and a Citroen ZK and BX, Peugeot 605 and o Citroln XM. But each marque has a v distinct identity. Few drivers would mistake an XM for a Peugeot, a 605 for a Citroen; and AX and 106 are by no means clones under a different skin. Even so, it would not surprise me if the Citroen AX, recently much improved by a mid-life facelift, turned out to be one of 106's toughest com- petitors. It now feels much less of a lightweight, far more a junior mem- ber of the ZX family. The AX already comes with 3door or 5-door bodies, petrol or diesel engines and costs from Â£5,895 to Â£9,205. These are class leading prices. Unless I have read the signs wrongly, comparable 106s will be at least 10 per cent dearer. And the AX is good to drive, far quieter than it used to be and the GTi model I tried the other week rode better than its Peugeot 106 TSi equiv- alent. So, we may have a family fght on our hands Peugeot vs Citroen as well as Peugeot vs the rest"

   "text_content" : "almost to a halt on Thursday afternoon. Do not expect your stockbroker to return your calls. He will be at Twicken- ham. The City shuts up shop annually for the Varsity match each December but that is small beer compared with what will happen this coming week. The second World Cup starts on Thursday and the opening ceremony gets underway at 2 pm. An hour later England will play New Zealand in the opening match of what is being described as the biggest sporting event in Britain since the World Cup of 1966, soc- cer's world cup that is. You get an idea of the size of this year's event from these fig- ures: 63 countries will receive televised transmission with an estimated audience of more than 2bn people generating an estimated Â£23m. It will be a relief to get on with the motley. To date, the World Cup has been synony- mous with sordid accusations of incompetence in many areas. There was a row over ticket allocations. It has been said that the press coverage has been poor. Many people in rugby are puzzled at a system that can leave Clive Norling, the world's best referee, in the stand during the month-long championship. The commer- cial advisers have come in for criticism. To cap it all, with less than three weeks to the opening ceremony, Keith Prowse, the leading UK ticket agency, went bust. By tea-time on Thursday all these issues will have been overtaken by the outcome of the England v New Zealand game and the questions aris- ing therefrom. The chief one of these is whether England has any chance of winning the World Cup. We know New Zea- land has. The All Blacks, the reigning champions, are nar- row favourites. It is fashionable to say the All Blacks are not what they were. Their forwards are not as fearsome or fast and their backs are a less potent strike force than in teams of yore. But, nothing is what it was, not the pound sterling nor the 1 Bank of England, not Mars bars nor the Rock of Gibraltar. Though I admit the All Blacks are not as strong as they were in 1987, I do not r think they are significantly I weaker. If we are questioning their grip on the World Cup it k is more because of the advance t of other countries and less the decline of New Zealand. 1 England are one country who I are transformed since 1987, f Scotland are another, and Aus- 1 tralia, particularly Australia, - are the third. f Yet the All Blacks still hold s the Bledisloe Cup. They acted a quickly after their 21-12 defeat - by Australia in the first test, a importing John Hart, the guileful Auckland coach, to help Grizz Wyllie, and stop- a ping up the cracks in the for- F wards apparent in Sydney. The t result was a dogged victory in r the second Test in Auckland. e New Zealand has the greatest heritage of any nation in the World Cup. No one tours as e well as the All Blacks, who are never better than when they are embattled. Most of all, they frighten the opposition, though no one would admit it. I believe the Australians lost their nerve when faced with victory in the second Test recently. Deep in their subcon- scious they were too respectful of the New Zealanders, their heritage, their position in the game, to nail them as they were capable of doing and should have done. For England, little if any- thing has been left to chance. I have in front of me an eight- page programme which lists what England's players and management will be doing at any given moment up to the final in November. It began last Thursday When at \"12.30 hrs\" the squad assembled for lunch at the Petersham Hotel, transferred to a hotel in Hampshire at 14.00 with a press conference at Twicken- ham en route. At 16.00 came final kitting out and medical checks, at 18.30 a squad meet- ing and at 19.30 dinner. Later there was ten pin bowling but that was optional. There is a routine like this for every one of the next 28 days. The attention to detail is remarkable in England's brave new world. It explains partly why England have won 15 of their last 20 internationals, losing only to Wales (1989), Scotland (1990), Argentina (1990), and Australia (1991). England's success or failure centres on their forwards. Can they dominate and thus run the game at their pace, releas- ing their potent strike force of backs as and when they please. Or will they be on the back foot from the start, moved around the field too fast for comfort, unable to dominate in the set pieces? Only Scotland have a realis- tic chance among the other home countries, one that is not diminished by their playing every match at home - so long as they keep winning. Ireland and Wales will do well to reach the quarter finals. The one country that has everything that the All Blacks have - and more - is Austra- lia. A rock solid front row, a superb line-out, a tearaway back row and perhaps the best half backs in the world. What more do you need? You need the experience that only comes from years of touring, from playing hundreds of Tests against sides that want to top- ple you. This breeds an inner resolve that the New Zealand- ers have in abundance. There is no aspect of coach- ing or preparation the Austral- ians have not examined but this sort of experience cannot be coached. It must be learnt. Australia have advanced so fast that this may be the one faculty they have not been able to acquire. This may be their downfall when, as I expect, they face the All Blacks in one semi-final in Lansdowne Road on Sunday October 27. Man for man the Australians look better. Can they prove that on the day? Whoever wins that game will win the World Cup. And I think it will be New Zealand - by five points in Dublin. J.H.",

   "text_content" : "Muhammad Ali on boxing: \"I guess you have to be a little crazy to be a fighter.\" Joe Frazier, after their fight in Manila: \"I hit him punches, those punches, they'd of knocked a building down. And he took 'em. He took 'em and he came back. But I sent him home worse than he came. Look at him now; he's damaged goods.\" BOXING is dangerous. Michael Watson knew that as surely as anyone. It is sporting combat stripped to its essentials, the purest challenge of athletic skill and strength. The ring is the site of displays of extraordinary cour- age as well as grotesque mis- matches. But, almost against the best efforts of shameless promoters and hapless manag- ers boxing can transcend the humdrum of most physical endeavour and take on almost mystical qualities. No-one personifies the sport's contradictions better than Muhammad Ali. Thomas Hauser's biography, published in Britain at a time when the dangers of boxing are once again under scrutiny, gives a moving and humane account of Ali's career. His life is rich in ironies, perhaps the greatest being his symbolic emascula- tion by the white establish- ment, which first hated him, then gradually accepted him, before finally claiming him as a hero. The challenging, brash young man who sparked politi- cal and cultural controversy in the 1960s is now a quiet, largely mute figure, alone with his religion and his memories. From black villain to black simpleton via worldwide recog- nition as perhaps the greatest boxer, athlete and showman - given such rich material, it is curious that Hauser relies on obviously edited transcripts of numerous interviews. One reason might be that boxing has an unfair share of opinionated loud-mouths. But only a few of the bit players in Ali's hectic life shed light on the man - notably a series of anecdotes on his unreasonable generosity to all and sundry including the undeserving. It is a testament to Ali's enduring power as a sporting and cul- tural icon that the book remains highly readable. The big fights in All's career receive a full treatment, in par- ticular the 1975 thriller in Manila, his third fight with Joe Frazier. It was a brutal bout, described by All afterwards as the closest thing to death he ever experienced. His ringside doctor said the champion took a day before his thought pro- cesses were unscrambled. His body took weeks to recover. Such accounts should be a warning to all those who par- ticipate in boxing. It matters little precisely what Ali suffers from today. The fact is that his brain suffered from his perse- verance in boxing long past his prime. Boxing is a young man's game, but even young men like Watson get killed. If only so much of the hand- wringing that follows tragedies like Watson's was not shot through with misunderstand- ing and mis-placed morality. Some of the boxing establish- ment's defences of the sport are as crude as Dennis Andries' punching style, but they are as effective. What is the answer to promoter Mike Barrett's cunning comparison with smoking, a voluntary pas- stime which kills thousands? Governments can barely con- trol, some would say connive at, the irresponsible selling of tobacco to children. Yet many would see a ban on tobacco as an unacceptable invasion of the personal rights. Of all the charges made against the sport, the one which really sticks, and which is echoed throughout Hauser's book, is that many of its insid- ers represent the greatest obstacle to progress. It is stri- king, though, that the role of television has received so little attention. Hauser and his wit- nesses show how All's career coincided with and catalysed the development of television coverage of boxing. The stakes grew higher, the money flowed faster using boxing's tradi- tional mastery of hype. All's greatest hype came in his youth, when his mind was buzzing as fiercely as his fists were stinging. * Muhammad Ali, His Life and Times, Thomas Hauser with the co-operation of Muhammad Ali.

   "text_content" : "F IT WERE cheaper to rent a property than to buy it, no one would want to rent it out in the first place. When rents are lower than the costs of finance to purchase a prop- erty - as they are now - there is every incentive for would-be home- buyers to put their savings on deposit and become tenants. Yet any such gap between rent costs and property purchase costs undermines the case for remaining a landlord. If the property were to be accurately valued on an opportu- nity, cost-of-money basis, the land- lord would be better off selling the building and investing the cash. These truisms assume a perfectly functioning housing market. In practice the housing market is pro- soundly imperfect. There may be no fundamental case for becoming a landlord, yet gross rental returns of 8 per cent on prime central London apartments and houses (or up to 10 per cent with canny buying of \"dis- tressed sale\" properties) are attract- ing investors back. Why? Because investors are not buying for immediate yield; man- agement costs and allowances for repairs and maintenance cut the- returns down to less than half the immediately achievable yield on, say, a standard bank deposit. The punters are looking, as they always do, to a combination of current income and eventual capital growth; their purchase decision rests - to a substantial extent - on \"hope\" value. This begs a question. If investors in property are correct in assuming that today's best properties for rent are at or near their low point in terms of resale value, their tenants are enjoying a temporary saving at the expense of an eventual capital cost. Apply this to a single property and you get a simple equation: one winner and one loser - tenant or landlord. Or, rather, it would be a simple equation if both tenant and landlord had a free choice to buy or sell. In practice, this \"pure market\" approach is confounded by tenants who have made no conscious deci- sion to rent, and by \"reluctant\" landlords. More people seem to be analysing the costs of accommodation and choosing to rent - but, still, these renters-by-choice are far outnum- bered by tenants who rent for no more sophisticated reason than that they cannot afford to buy. On the other side of the counter, many individual homeowners, housebuilders and residential devel- opers would sell if they could sell. Because they are unable to attract buyers, they have joined reluctant landlords who seek some cost cover for their investment by renting. a Unless market research carried a out for mortgage lenders has been n made redundant by the recession and its attaching gloom, personal e home ownership remains the pre- > ferred housing tenure for eight in 10 s people in the age groups most likely .- to form independent households in n the 1990s. And while the legislative background to private renting has it been changed by the 1988 Housing s Act, which grants new freedoms to g landlords, any talk of a revival of o the private rented sector in Britain i- must be treated as premature. I- Prospects for the renting sector in e the 1990s cannot be looked at in isolation from a long history of y decline. In the past there were simi- a lar periods of remission for private i- renting; each time, socio-political o pressures against \"profit out of a another person's home\" brought the if remission period to an end. Over a more than 70 years, the public 0 image of the private residential landlord in Britain has shifted from - neutral investor to virtual social outcast. t In 1914, nine in 10 households - were privately rented. Add in \"tied\" r houses (which went with particular S- jobs),\"live in\" domestic servants, s and assorted shop and factory work- ers in company-owned homes, and a the picture of housing tenure in s Britain before the First World War t shows that individual home owner- 1 ship was not even a distant aspira- i tion for the average household. 1 Following a pattern unchanged for nearly 200 years, the overwhelm- i ing quantity of urban housing was r developed by speculative builders t specifically for rent. Building stan- i dards reflected the eventual rent to s be charged. Thus, in London, Victo- t rian builders would talk in terms of I Â£5, or Â£8, or Â£12 properties - and construct them to a budget aimed at achieving a stable 10 per cent gross return. i Social historians have made I much of the self-help groups and r pioneer building societies formed, mainly in the industrial north of a England, during the middle and later 19th century to enable skilled workers to build homes of their own. But it was not so much the infant building societies, rather the 1 1915 Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act that changed the - course of housing history. > That Act, controlling rents and t providing security of tenure for ten- ants, was devised to stop wartime profiteering. Although introduced as an emergency measure, its con- trols remained in force on existing properties after the First World War. New tenancies were not affected by its provisions. Many of the homes built between the First and the Second World Wars were 4 n 11 n 0 'e )f n a n if e e r 1, s r I. developed for renting by private investors. At the same time, a whole new source of properties for rent was created by local authorities charged with building \"homes for heroes,\" subsidised by the Treasury. Never- theless, landlords of older, rent-con- trolled properties sold up whenever the opportunity arose: by 1938, more than 500,000 such sales had taken place. Some 68 per cent of UK households still rented their homes, but the 6.6m privately-owned rent- als now represented fewer than six in 10 of all homes. Further rent controls, imposed during the Second World War, froze landlords' income - and kept that income static through a period of exceptionally high building cost inflation which persisted into the 1950s. The consequent accelerated deterioration of privately-owned rented houses split the rental mar- ket into two broad categories. The largest consisted of older properties: these ranged between slums, a mass of cheap flats over shops, and low- cost suburban houses. The other group consisted of high value prop- erties; mainly rented apartment blocks in central London. Attempts to revive the private rented sector led to the 1957 Rent Act's short-lived reprise away from controls, intended to attract fresh investors by de-regulating new ten- ancies. It did not work. Public attitudes to renting had changed. This was the era of the rogue' landlord; sto- ries of sitting tenants \"winkled out\" so that owners could gain posses- sion sharpened the image of a land- lord as socially unacceptable. Within a year, new regulations reversed most of the 1957 Act's effect, protecting sitting tenants in what had been, briefly, decontrolled tenancies. (rather than re-renting) of vacant properties reduced the number of private sector rented homes to below 4m by the mid-1960s: one quarter of the total housing stock. Householders may have needed no extra incentive to turn their backs on the decaying rental market, but they got one: preferential tax treatment for own- er-occupiers and, with the rapid expansion of building societies dur- ing the 1960s and 1970s, much easier access to home loan finance. In 1974 a new Rent Act extended security of tenure to tenants of fur- nished as well as unfurnished prop- erties. Flat \"break-up\" companies flourished; trading companies which bought apartment blocks from traditional investor landlords and speeded the process of individ- ual apartment sales. The number of privately owned properties avail- able for rent fell from 3.4m in 1970 to 2.5m by the start of the 1980s. This decline continued through- .out the decade. The option to rent was further reduced by the \"right to buy\" provisions of the 1980 Housing Act. It is against this long-term exo- dus from rental accommodation that the 1988 Housing Act has to operate. It has created the new form of \"shorthold tenancies,\" enabling owners to enter into occupation agreements running for a minimum of six months at a time. Now, own- ers can charge open-market rents and retain rights of repossession of their property. Before the Act came into force, early in 1989, the private rental market had contracted to three main sectors: * The largest consisted of the resid- ual stock of older, controlled-rent properties. * A second, substantial sub-market was made up of informal rentals, where landlords circumvented the tenancy and rent laws by refusing to provide rent books, charging \"key money\" premiums to incoming tenants, and a whole range of ille- gal, cash-only transactions. * The third sector consisted mainly of central London properties bought as investments and leased out at full open-market prices to compa- nies needing to accommodate staff \"on tour\" in the UK capital for sev- eral months or a few years. The first and second sectors of the rentals market remain largely unaffected by the new legislation. Established tenancies remain uneconomic for property owners. It is hard to see many of these long-term landlords treating a vacancy as an opportunity to re-en- ter the rental market on a more commercial footing. It is to the third sector, the com- pany rental market, that the new shorthold landlords have turned, both to find a reference for current open-market rents and for accept- able standards of accommodation and property management. Regarding rents, accommodation costs have been rising at less than the rate of inflation over the past two years. The reason for this has been the many houses and flats arriving on the lettings market; given a more active property trans- ser market, these would be sold. Regarding accommodation stan- dards,few individual owners appre- ciate that tenants are only willing to pay full open market rents for properties in excellent condition. Developers with unsold blocks of flats need only furnish the units to offer mint-condition space. Many private owners have been taken aback - told by their letting agencies that the home in which The price gap between the two tiers of London's rental market Is narrowing, but the diference between prime property and \"cheap\" property rents remains vast. The London Housing Unit's recent capital-wide rent survey shows a 20 per cen Increase In costs In tho past year, with landlords charging an average Â£330 a month for a bedut, Â£616 a month for a one-bedroom flat and Â£1,178 a month for a five-bedroom house. Look beyond average homes to prime properties, and although agencies report a yar of stable or even softening of rents on lattings to company and wealthler Individual tenants, cost comparisons remain roughly four to one. Yet there Is still strong Interest In well appointed west central area family houses, such as this tour-bedroom Chelsea housh (left) on the books of Vogue rentals (t1l: 071-373-803) and available unfurnished for Â£1,250 a week. they have lived happily for years is too poorly decorated, ill-furnished or badly-fitted to interest a prospec- tive tenant willing to hand over sev- eral hundred pounds a week for trouble-free accommodation. Private owners tend also to be surprised that rental management is not free. Investors understand that management costs can absorb perhaps a quarter of their gross return on a property, but amateur landlords - reluctant amateur landlords especially - are slow to grasp that tenant selection, rent col- lection, and dealing with anything from a leaking tap to a set of lost keys involves active management. favour of a substantial rental sector in today's housing market have been well aired. The choice to rent assists mobility of labour; it allows for changing family circumstances; it provides housing for a substantial part of the UK population with nei- ther the money nor the inclination to take on the long-term commit- ment of owner-occupation. Sad sta- tistics on home repossessions high- light the miseries which may follow when people who want their own property are encouraged to borrow their way into it. Government controls on public sector spending have prevented local authorities from responding to the demand for lower-cost rental accommodation. Much effort has gone into public and private sector co-operation to create affordable housing for rent through Housing Associations, and into investment groups seeking to maximise the tax concessions on developments of homes for rent through Business Expansion Schemes. But neither has come near to replacing the number of homes removed from the rental market by local authority sales. So, if this leaves the burden of providing rental accommodation to the private residential landlord, there is no hard evidence to support the view that the economic events of the past two years represent a basis for long-term revival of the sector. Any improvement in turn- over of the residential property market will surely signal a scram- ble of reluctant landlords seeking to sell. And while the top layer of corpo- rate rentals continues to attract investors, few individual and no institutional investors have shown any interest in financing more pro- saic properties for rent - notwith- standing the protection provided by the 1988 Housing Act.

   "text_content" : "HESE ARE bard times for foreign correspon. dents in London. They have given up on the tedious round of speculation about the next electipn - not the outcome, but the date. Nothing interesting has been written about John Major since the Economic Summit in July. Only if you are a Croat are there interesting local stories, as we shall learn. And abroad the British may be glad to know that they are not seen as they sometimes see them- selves. There are three instances this week where they appear more like they were, circa 1900. Powerful, careless of foreign opinion and masters of underhand realpolitik in the cause of freedom. First to the Croats. They are winning one war at least - in the media. This has had diplo- matic consequences. The last copy of the Zagreb Vjesnik to arrive asked if the Germans and the French agree on recog- nition for Croatia \"can Britain put a spoke in the wheel?\" The paper's London correspondent, Jasna Zanic-Nardini, has combed the I British media to see if their \"Balkanologists\" can sway official opinion. She starts with a tribute to the television correspondent, Martin Bell - \"The BBC demands from him a sober, balanced approach - f and that is what it gets from r this experienced professional.\" The only succour for the Croatian cause Zanic-Nardini can gain is his remark that he had never witnessed a more dangerous war. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Daily Telegraph is exten- i sively quoted and provides the headline for the article with i his comment that the Serbian regime had deliberately revived the \"ancient hatreds\" of Yugoslavia to launch an \"atavistic war against Croatia.\" The Independent is also approvingly mentioned; it believes that recognition could reflect a \"just concern for world order.\" Croatia, of course, sees itself as part of the New World Order, whatever it may be, while Serbia seems to play into hands of its oppo- nents by representing one that has collapsed. In Belgrade there is little concern for the niceties of international opinion; most reporting comes from the Cro- atian side. And in Zagreb it is hoped this will push the Brit- ish into line. The mayor of Pforzheim in south west Germany has the same hope. This story begins on February 23, 1945. The RAF used 392 heavy bombers to destroy Pforzheim and more than a fifth of the 80,000 inhab- itants died in the raid. It was part of the strategic bombing offensive of Lord \"Bomber\" Harris. A statue of Harris Is to be erected in London and the Queen Mother has promised to unveil it. Oberbtrgermeister Becker has protested to the British Ambassador. The mayors of other cities flattened by the RAF are joining in as is the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zei- tung. \"There exists, next to war-guilt, also war-conduct- guilt which employs inhumane methods that conflict with human rights in the name of a war waged for democracy and humanity... In Dresden, a city that was a victim of Harris-bar- barity just before Pforzheim, there are good people of the post-GDR period who are con- cerned that there still has not been one word of regret from the British. A memorial for \"Butcher\" Harris would be the opposite.\" The FAZ supported the stra- tegic bombing offensive con- ducted by the US Air Force against North Vietnam. MEN The curious affair of P-26 was scarcely reported in Britain. An investigation sponsored by the Swiss government found that the British secret services, including the SAS, had clan- destinely helped organise a \"resistance group,\" P-26, in Switzerland. It was intended to operate as a \"stay-behind-organisation\" in the event of the continent being overrun by the Red Army. It was linked to the Gla- dio organisation which origi- nated in Italy and caused a scandal that nearly toppled President Cossiga last year. Swiss cabinet ministers knew nothing of the operations of P-26 which was backed by the unadventurously named P-27 force. P-27 kept files on Swiss \"subversives\" - presum- ably those citizens who flush their lavatories after 10pm. The Neue Ztircher Zeitung took these revelations in its stride. It said that nothing had come to light that warranted a further investigation into the activities of P-26. But the report had revealed that \"rela- tions with the British went far beyond anything previously known. However, the Federal Council in its statement cor- rectly recognised the benefits provided by the British ser- vices. It should not be forgot- ten that without the rich expe- rience (NZZ's italics) which Britain had accumulated in this area - not least because of its active support for interna- tional resistance, against the Third Reich - the post-war construction of a Swiss anti- Communist resistance organi- sation would have been scarcely possible.\" Many may find it \"scarcely possible\" that the Swiss turned to the British for advice on how to run secret operations i Things are tough at Pravda - I \"world's largest daily sale\" - t these days. It has had to issue an appeal to the government in a the form of an editorial. \"This year, by force of cir- r cumstance, Pravda has found r itself in a critical situation. As 1 a result of a number of legally unfounded decisions, we have i found ourselves to be economic bankrupts without any pros- pects... Pravda is part of our history, it is a national asset i which individuals - whatever i position they may currently > occupy - have no right to dis- pense with.\" r 0 James Morgan is Economics Correspondent of the BBC World Service.",

Propagation is by division in spring but plants do not need to be divided frequently as they are rather slow in re-establishing themselves.

   "text_content" : "which is the greatest of the 18th century English land- scape gardens. Is it Studley Royal, Castle Howard, Rousham, Stourhead or Stowe? There is no doubt that Stowe has the greatest number of buildings - and this has made it particularly difficult to preserve. Trees, lakes and grass are relatively easy to manage. Trees can be replaced a few at a time and can be managed so that they are self-renewing. Water is to a considerable degree self-maintaining, although it can be costly to keep it free of weeds, and grass can be grazed by cattle or sheep, which was the original inten- tion and was why the ha-ha, or con- cealed ditch, was invented, since it prevented cattle from straying. Buildings are a totally different matter. Even the best fall into disre- pair and, as has become plain in the present thorough assessment of Stowe by the National Trust, many of the most impressive of them were not well-built. \"Bodger\" is a term that has been : applied to some of the builders who e worked at Stowe. To be fair to I- them, they were not building for y posterity. They were making con- 1, ceits to satisfy the ambitions and vanity of the great men who owned s the properties and imagined them- selves as Roman patricians, creat- y ing scenery that was actually an s improvement on that of ancient o Rome and Greece. a Some of them, and particularly d Lord Cobham and his successor \\. Earl Temple at Stowe, were pre- e pared to move buildings from one e place to another, if the first site did d not prove entirely to their lik- r ing.They would make building L- alterations to suit their whim. It I- was all a game, rather like making t gigantic theatrical sets, and they had the wealth and the self-confi- It dence to carry it out. It is not wise to ascribe too much e importance to the professional f architects and designers who y worked for these gifted amateurs. e To a considerable extent they did what they were told, and, if it did a not satisfy, they were told to do it o again, or someone else was o engaged. r All this is relevant to Stowe's i- future. A few years ago, it seemed a almost impossible to save, except, i perhaps, in some truncated form. i- Since 1921 the mansion has been t- the home of the public school, and a the management did all that was it possible to prevent 32 notable gar- den buildings and monuments from y sinking into disrepair, an increas- r ingly difficult task. Then, in 1989, an anonymous e benefactor and the National Heri- d tage Memorial Fund made it possi- ;- ble for the ownership of the gardens g to be transferred to the National [t Trust, for the school to lease back g sports facilities and for a national y appeal for a further elm to be i- launched to provide a substantial endowment, though it seems to me li that much more money will be il required before Stowe is fully o restored and safe. But a highly sat- i. isfactory beginning has been made. d A computerised survey of the gar- a dens has been completed and Laser t Survey of Worcester is undertaking a detailed topographical examina- tion of 100 hectares of garden, including all trees, shrubs, wood- lands, stumps, paths, buildings and contours, which can be added to, reduced in scale, or enlarged with ease. All historical information available in the UK is being studied and also records held at the Hun- tingdon Library in California, which has much material about the making of Stowe. Already several buildings, includ ing the beautiful Temple of Ancient Virtue, are under repair, a good deal of planting is being under- taken, and some trees are being removed, in accordance with what has been revealed by the thorough tree surveys. But perhaps what is of greatest interest to those members of the general public who are concerned about the preservation of this remarkable landscape garden is that, for the first time for many years, it is possible to view it easily and in comfort. A new entrance for National Trust members and the public has The Palladlan bridge at stowS been made just north of the school, close to the Temple of Concord and Victory, and from here a continuous path, or in the area of The Elysian Fields, a circulating path has been made right round the great land- scape to include all the famous buildings and monuments and the important view-points. Nearly all this path is made smooth and resil- ient to walk on by being deeply covered with bark and wood chip- pings. There is an almost endless supply of raw material for this at Stowe and the chipping is done on site according to requirements. I suppose there must be at least two miles of path (it certainly felt like that, when I walked most of the way round it the other day), and, if you are old or handicapped, the National Trust will lend you a Batricar free of charge if the five they own are not already in use when you arrive. Visiting times are a little compli- cated because they vary, according to whether the school is in term or i not. During vacations, it is open vir- tually daily from 10 am to 6 pm or dusk. But when the pupils are there, access is difficult. However, at the moment, until October 17, 1 openings are on Mondays, Wednes- days and Fridays from 10 am to 5 i pm. OnOctober 18-27, December i 27-31 and January 1- 5th, 1992, the i school is closed and the garden open. It is closed on the December 25-26. Arthur Hellyer",

   "text_content" : "JAMSHED Mirzoev does not look like a man to start a moral revolution. Small, nervous, and habitually dressed in a purple Soviet tracksuit, he runs a shabby state shop in a remote Tajik mountain village. But last month he commit- ted a sin which plunged his village into controversy. Ille- gally, he raised the sacred price of flour - still at its 1950s level in Soviet Tajikistan - by two kopeks a kilo. Until then, he told me, as he sat in his rickety shop disconsolately sucking powdery green \"nos\" (the local narcotic), he had favoured a quiet life. In common with state shop- keepers across the Soviet Union, he collects an erratic supply of goods, allocated to him each month from a central distributor in his local city, Dushanbe, and half-heartedly attempts to sell it If the allocation happens to be in cubed sugar, cooking oil, or matches, it sells out in min- utes. If it comes in the form of tins of salted seaweed salad or Afghan olives, it does not sell at all; Tajiks distrust such \"for- eign\" food. But because central planners decree that all shops in the district should be stocked with such stuff, no matter whether Ukrainians like it or Tajiks hate it, every month he dutifully re-stacks his tins, trying to camounage them behind rolls of cloth as the pile grows. Moved by a mixture of sym- 3 pathy and curiosity, I actually ) bought some - the first person to do so for years. I found the 1 olives delicious, the salted sea- i weed unspeakable. I \"It makes no difference to me whether people buy them or not - I get paid whatever I do,\" he explained to me. 3 But last month, fired by the - new market philosophy and a 1 healthy dose of self interest, 5 along with a certain jealousy of i the new co-operative semi-pri- 1 vate shops in Dushanbe, he Gillian Tett on the great flour t debate that split a Tajik village f decided to make a stand. He put up his flour price. 7 The logic was text book eco- nomics. Getting the flour out - of the clutches of Dushanbe f bureaucrats and up the moun- r tain road to the tiny village 1 shop takes a considerable - effort. The roads are regularly I destroyed by earthquakes and 3 landslides; the distributors in ! Dushanbe increasingly vague > about the whereabouts of the 3 flour- the villagers so keen to f buy it that the mererumour of i a flour truck isenoughtotrig- a ger scenes o impending vi- Slence, with village grandmoth- ers clustering around the store waving empty hands at the beleaguered storekeeper. \"If Jamshed felt he was get- ting something out of it, even just a couple of kopeks, then maybe he'd try a bit harder to get more flour into the shop,\" explained Mirzoev's brother, Husein, who works in a mine further down the valley and is rumoured - like the relatives of all Tajik state shopkeepers - to be sitting secretly on a larger supply of flour. But the villagers were furi- I ous. However confused or v bored they are by Soviet poli- e tics, everyone knows that only t a month ago Kakhor Makhka- s mov, the Tajik president, ner- I vously promised that the price I of flour - which had briefly t gone up during the April price * rises - would be frozen to the s \"pre-reform\" level. I asked a group of self-righ- teous grandmothers gathered i round the shop why flour I should be different from any t other product. \"Because if the N price of flour rises we'll c starve!\" shrieked a formidable I and well-fed woman who only t the week before had told me, t smugly, how much better the h food supply was in Tajikistan i than in Moscow. c \"Because the price ries are I an attack on socialism,\" explained the village brigade leader. If everything becomes t a cooperatve, then it' be run i by the Mafia\" The village brigade leader I sports an improbably huge t moustache and a chestful of medals form Senond World 1 \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t War exploits in Germany which have left him with an enduring admiration for the black and white cows he once spotted near Berlin. It would have been tactless to remind him that socialism was already under attack. Like many of his generation he is not merely a socialist, but a sincere admirer of Stalin. Enthusiasm for communism, however, has never prevented him from milking his family's brown cows, tending his pri- vate kitchen plots with pride, or selling his produce in the local markets - even during the Stalinist period. And though the prices in these mar- kets have been steadily spiral- Hing upwards for months, he continues to buy his lemons, heauscarves or tomatoes there without protet. Nevertheless it would appear that state flor is in a dierent ideological category from lem- ons. Durhlg the ensuing weeks MirMoev's shop door remahied firmly shuLt. Pam time to time the vil- lage brigi er issued threats that if sacks of flour did not appear in the shop soon, Mir- zoev would receive no more petrol (the petrol pump was controlled by the brigadier's brother). Mirzoev darkly hinted that if his flour price was not accepted, the village shoppers would find them- selves doomed to a future of shelves stacked with tinned seaweed salad. Salvation finally arrived. At the gathering of the village elders someone suggested that although raising the price of floor was unthinkable, charg- ing extra for the flour sacks, instead, did not in itself threaten the foundation of socalsm. The thin edge of the market seemed at last to be wedged under the door of the village state shop. Miroev was back in business within a day. \"Now Im going to do everything I can to sell lots of flour,\" he said. Whether he yet feels com- mitted to marketing his state tins of salted seaweed salad remains to be seen.",

   "text_content" : "Robin Lane Fox likes his red hot pokers in shades of cream and green-lemon VERY YEAR, the ground becomes as hard as a brick when we are all supposed to be planting daffodils. I have postponed the spadework and have continued to think how best to upgrade my autumn in future. These plans are a long-term matter which need effort now and a look at other people's results. They also need a knot in gardeners' handkerchiefs. This past month, I have seen new possibilities at the Royal Horticul- tural Society's Great Autumn show in London and at great public gardens, planned for a long display. The ideas need to be stored until next spring and for results a year, perhaps three years, hence. Autumn otherwise becomes a list of good intentions. By looking and travelling, I have revised some old prejudices. If you want to terrorise a thoughtful plants- person, you would probably threaten her with red hot pokers, dahlias and salvias, the redder the better. All three of these visual nemeses have risen to the top of my list of good intentions because there is more to them that most of us realise. For a start, red hot pokers no lon- ger have to be red hot. They come in shades of cream and enviable green- lemon, colours which are all the rage in any other type of plant. It was only an unfortunate accident that the large family of the Kniphofla became popu- lar and well known for its harsh ram- rods of orange and red. Varieties of greater delicacy have always lurked in the family and smaller nurseries have brought them back into the open. At the Great Autumn show, a pale yellow poker called Little Maid had become decid- edly widespread. I can well under- stand why as it is totally hardy, a Autumn is the time to revise old prejudices and dead-head the dahlias pleasant colour and multiplies easily although prices begin at about Â£2.50 for one plant. It is not the best available. There are pokers in shades of pale peach, a tall cream-yellow (Torchbearer) and best of all, some bi-coloured forms with cream spikes of flower and dark red-brown tips (Modesta, perhaps, is the best of them). Take your pick from this year's Plantfinder and do not recoil from prices of up to Â£5 a plant. Each one soon multiplies so that it can be split into half a dozen. Pale-coloured pokers are set to be the stars of the 1990s as soon as garden centres wake up to them and their wholesalers multiply the stock. What surprises me most is the wide span of their season, from July until late October when flowers begin to appear on forms like Green Jade. The same season is a virtue of dahlias, so long as you dead-head them, an enjoy- ably squishy experience. Mauve pompoms and the shaggy cactus-flowered forms have given dahlias a bad name among aesthetes, but once again, travels and time at the shows have taught me to look again. Like all the great families, dahlias have highly desirable varieties, but you have to know where to look. The most elegant forms are classed as small waterlily, small cactus and col- larette, and the colours range from white through cream-pink to a really dark red. One of the best ways to pick a decent dahlia is to head for the North Orbital Road, turn off the A414 at London Colney, near St Albans, and visit Ayletts whose vast range has won an RHS gold medal every year since 1961. Ayletts have some awful mauves and over-sized forms but they also have beauties like the cream- white Abridge Snowflake which would fit into any civilised scheme. Plants for 1992 have to be collected next April, May or June and will cost a standard Â£1.45 each: the journey is worth it. As for salvias, they already have their place in the sun, but it owes little to the awful scarlet forms which seedsmen offer as annuals and seem only to appeal to the French. Once again, you need to look, note and play the Plantfinder in order to acquire the emergent stars in this family. The blue forms are becoming famil- iar, but the ones which impress me most are the vibrant rose-pinks and cherry reds. At Powis Castle, the rich rose-red confertiflora stands out in the garden's half-hardy bedding and lasts well into October, after the col- lapse of early border plants, you can bed these tall salvias into the gaps and give the garden new body and height. The easiest are two cherry-rose varieties with the shape of small shrubs. Salvias grahamii and neure- pia flower continuously but only turn up on the balconies of informed gar- deners. They ought to be far more popular because they last for weeks and in mild winters will live to flower again. Their small tips of cherry-red flower have none of the harshness of the seedsmen's popular forms. They are also far cheaper because one plant will give you dozens of easy cuttings which root at once and can be brought through the winter in any frost-proof place or cupboard. Find a willing owner and privatise some bits for yourself: they change the range of autumn, a time when red hot pokers can be pale and pleasant and even the dahlias can be a mild cream-pink.",

   "text_content" : "RNESTO Diaz Rodri- gues is one of Cuba's most distinguished writers. Until this summer, when he was unex- pectedly released and allowed to go into exile, he was the longest serving imprisoned writer known to International PEN. He was first jailed in 1968; his punishment was increased in 1974; after 23 years, his sen- tence still had 17 years to run. During his imprisonment he wrote 10 books and learnt lan- guages listening to the radio. On his recent visit to London he showed me the manuscript of his latest book. It is a tight wedge of paper rolled smaller than a tennis ball and covered with handwriting so minuscule that it can scarcely be read by the naked eye. Even when, in common with the other politi- cal prisoners, Diaz refused to wear uniform, he was able to keep his book by him at all times tucked in his underwear. International PEN, an organ- isation of writers with 86 cen- tres round the world, cam- paigns on behalf of colleagues who have been imprisoned for no other reason than that their writings have offended the authorities. PEN tries to keep in touch with them and sends books to any prisoners who are permitted to receive them. In recent yeaI there have been spectacular improve- ments All the prisoned writ- ers to the ontries of the fbr- mer Soviet Union and of Eastern Europe were released shortly after Mikhail Gorba- chev came to power. This sum- mer many Turkish writers whose imprisonment dated back to the military coup of 1980 were freed, although oth- ers are still held for writing about the Kurds. Jack Mapanje, imprisoned in Malawi without trial since 1987 for the alleged political content William St Clair on a campaign for authors who are jailed or harassed of his poetry, is out, as is Ali Idrissi Kaitouni who in 1982 wrote a poem which was taken to be satirical of the king of Morocco. At the latest count there are still more than 300 writers and journalists known by name to be in prison. In the first few months of this year there were also reports of 21 killed in sus- picious circumstances, 10 kid- napped, 44 who have disap- peared, and over 100 charged or restricted in some way. In many countries of the Middle East, including the Israeli-occupied territories, writers are always at risk. In Kenya, Professor Edward Oyugl, a novest and writer on educational subjects, has recently been sentenced to seen ym for aleged sedition in calling for multi-party democracy. In China the clampdown continues. Reports describe prisoners being held in isolation cells 4 metres square with no access to books, tapes, or radio, no family visits and one exercise walk a week. Oppressive governments fear the power of ideas, and rightly so. The pen is not always migh- tier than the sword, but in the end it is more effective. South African customs officers are said to ask visitors: \"Any fire- arms or books?\" And it is not only governments who are intolerant of books with which they disagree. Salman Rushdie, a British citizen and member of English PEN, may not be in jail but he has lost his freedom. On Sunday October 6 at 6pm the National Film Theatre is arranging a special showing of Reunion, a beautiful and mov- ing story of friendship and loy- alty based on Fred Uhlman's novel Jason Robards plays the leading role. Harold Pinter, who wrote the screenplay, will then take part in a discussion with Simon Curtis. All the profits from the evening will go to help writers in prison. * Tickets are availabe from Euglish PEN at 7 Dtle Srsst, Lomnda SMW3 lE W 071-sr- 6S Wut prices start aor Â£7, those at Â£d2 and r25 ncue an cuwitatn as the rvaption Jbr te speakes * WiMoin St adais gcharma of the Wries-ft-Prison Cam- mittee of ia is PEN.",

   "text_content" : "Our Literary Editor has just read the sequel to Gone With The Wind \"GOD'S nightgown!\" as Scarlett O'Hara used to exclaim. Here's the much-hyped sequel to the world's Most Popular Novel. Great was the labour (or so Ms Ripley's 750 pages attest) and out comes... well, not a mouse but a conventional romance, a blockbuster unworthy of its model, igno- rant of the genius of Margaret Mitchell's bestseller. How does Gone With The Wind work? Why has it sold 28m copies (Macmillan has just released a new edition) and sired the world's most popular movie? What is it about Scarlett, that monstrous Southern beauty, and Rhett Butler, who will always look like Clark Gable, which captures the imagination? The answer - and it's an answer which is also the only way of making sense of the impact of any eternally popular bestseller, from King Solomon's Mines to James Bond - is that GWTW touches on the stuff of myth: that is to say, it relates to, it slots into, the symbolic images and archetypal tales of our cultural inheritance. You can talk about GWTW in the same language as The Odyssey or The Ring (yes, I exaggerate a little). What is GWTW about? Surely it's a G6t- terddmmerung (Margaret Mitchell actually uses the word) - a saga of the twilight of these white gods of the Confederate South. Intertwined is the tragedy of a child- woman struggling bravely to grow up, yet frustrated because of the faults of her character; it is a story of a love that fails in consequence of those faults - the death of the child of Scarlett and Rhett symbol- ises that. In mythic style, Scarlett takes refuge yet again in her Tara plantation, i.e. she returns to the Earth, which con- soles her and gives her new strength for her next journey in search of wealth and success and, above all, her man. It is, in its way, a masterpiece. A new biography of Mitchell, Southern Daughter, though far too long and inflated in the American style, is rather good when it reminds us how Scarlett's creator saw her warts and all. Scarlett, said a distin- guished psychologist, is a fascinating case a of a \"partial psychopath\", unable to d respond to true emotion, intent on the 1. pursuit of selfish and trivial goals; con- 's trary to her popular image, Scarlett is not 1, passionate but frigid (aroused to passion e, only by near-rape). Interestingly, Mitchell 3- apparently agreed with this interpretation 's and regretted that her intentions had been misread (especially by David Selznick's ? film) - she spent two years writing what s was intended as a \"radical, revisionary e and rebellious\" picture of the South, in It which she showed the traditionalists all n going under as they deserved. e SCARLETT h by Alexandra Ripley e Macmillan Â£15.99, 759 pages d SOUTHERN DAUGHTER: THE if LIFE OF MARGARET s MITCHELL a by Darden Asbury Pyron s Oxford Â£17.95, 560 pages(October24) So, what of Scarlett, commissioned from t- Alexandra Ripley by the Mitchell estate? y It starts with the benefit of the momen- if tum of the final chapters of GWTW, at the i. funeral of the saintly Melanie (who was of I- course the true heroine of the novel, it though it's easy to forget it). Old black r Mammy with her dying words makes s Rhett swear to watch over Scarlett, who h goes off to Atlanta. Charleston and Savan- L- nah; Her unflagging concern, as she prom- s ised in the last lines of GWTW, is to win i, back Rhett (\"He was the only man in the world who didn't wrinkle linen...\") r He rejects her for hundreds of pages I (\"You're a poison in my blood, Scarlett, a s sickness of my soul\") but he makes the mistake of taking her for a sail, which i almost drowns them and leaves them with i just enough energy to enjoy the only sex i bout in the book. Result, as always with v Scarlett, is Baby - but she doesn't tell - him because he has meanwhile married a e young girl who \"looks for all the world like Melanie\". So Scarlett goes off to Ireland - indeed, she spends nearly half the book there - with her Irish uncle, a Fenian priest. She eventually decides to marry a dastardly English earl, but drama intervenes and Rhett arrives and the English soldiers shoot Uncle Colum and - yes, \"Luxurious weak tears of exhaustion ran down her cheeks...'You've changed, Scarlett, you've grown up...\"' It's too easy to be rude. Why is this not-good-enough? Because it does not attempt to work either at a mythic level like its predecessor or even at a level of sophisticated storytelling. Thus, GWTW relied on a subtly interrelating foursome of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. Here, Ashley is jettisoned, Melanie is of course dead, and the only new character of any importance is the Irish priest, substituting for his brother, Scarlett's father. The result is that the dynamics of the plot are too thin. More important, in GWTW the personal adven- ture was profoundly and repeatedly linked with the historical drama of the defeat of the Confederates, the destruction of their classic way of life, and how they coped with the New Order. There is none of this here: the switch to Ireland hints at paral- lels but nowhere achieves them. The intention, I assume, was to note that in GWTW Scarlett has the instinct when in trouble to retreat to the land, to the beloved family farm, at Tara - so named after the mythic home of Ireland's High Kings. In Scarlett she retreats to the actual site of Tara, in County Meath, which happens to be where the O'Haras came from. She rescues the family and becomes \"The O'Hara\", but for all her ecstatic motherhood and her encounters with the local witch the tale is inadequate to carry any mythic dimension. She's simply a gutsy, pretty woman, coming on 31, who knows that she loves one man, and waits, and waits, for him to come to her. In the end he turns up. That's a competent romantic novel. No more.

   "text_content" : "T IME'S ARROW flies straight and true from the end of a man's life to its beginning in this audacious, utterly poised and almost moving short novel. The poise is essentially that between the author's lin- guistic and narrative virtuosity and his desire to say some- thing worth saying about the concentration camps. He was considering the pos- sibility of telling a life-story in reverse, he informs us in an afterword, when, after a tennis game with Robert Jay Liston, the latter gave him a copy of his book The Nazi Doctors, and two things dovetailed in Amis's mind. Such a narrative trick in itself would be merely amusing, Nazi subject matter by itself would be altogether unmanageable, but by putting that form with that content, so Amis must have conjectured, he might work a kind of moral magic which would open up both a difficult area of feeling and some new literary ground. Not wholly new ground, as it happens. While reading the novel, I caught on Radio 3 Brit- ten's incidental music for J.B. Priestley's 1939 play Johnson Over Jordan, which I was sur- prised to learn also traces its anti-hero's life-cycle in reverse; and the idea of consequence preceding action has of course a notable literary provenance in the figure of Lewis Carroll's White Queen, who screams first and pricks her finger afterwards. But I wouldn't be surprised if Amis got the idea from the rewinding of videos. He has dabbled with notions of time before, as for instance in the grotesque satire, \"The Time Disease\" (from his short story collection Einstein's Mon- sters), where time is a Aids-like virus afflicting rich, bored and clapped-out denizens of a post- nuclear quasi-Los Angeles with an alarming sheen of youthful- ness and spurts of unaccus- tomed energy. The new work takes this comic idea much further, and, indeed, rather beyond comedy, though there are jokes aplenty. The time-virus has become a nameless parasite resident on the body (and with access to the dreams) of a Don Juanish doctor, with whom it develops a one-sided relationship that is now matey, now wifely, but i always prone to disenchant- ment. The youthful recrudes- a cence has become the host's I regression in time, as narrated t by the bewildered, backwards- v seeing parasite, from the per- sona of middle American old Y lag Tod Friendly, through vari- ous expeditious changes of e place and identity, to being the assistant of a Dr Mengele fig- ure and administering Zyklon B in Auschwitz; then further back to impoverished German s childhood and birth. Julian Barnes enlisted a f woodworm as narrator for one I of the 10% chapters of his recent History of the World, so a bodiless parasite is going it one better. Like all Amis narra r tors, this one commands a prose of verve, intelligence and g rich metaphorical novelty; and TIME'S ARROW by Martin Amis Cape Â£13.99, 176 pages t to a dubious extent the device a is an excuse for hitherto undreamt-of flights of Craig Raine-ish \"Martian\" fancy. The parasite's description of using a New York yellow cab is delightful: \"They're always there when you need one, even in the rain or when the thea- tres are closing. They pay you up front, no questions asked. They always know where you're going. They're great. No wonder we stand there, for hours on end, waving goodbye, or saluting - saluting this fine service.\" But the parasite's unflinch- ing objectivity leads more often to what might be consid- ered tasteless remarks: \"Corpo- real life is not without its minor indignities. We still take it in the ass every morning, along with everybody else - but the whole thing's over in a trice these days. Tod, I salute you: what bowl know-how, what can can-do.\" The Jews being \"created\" from the air at Auschwitz are \"dying to be alive\". The Mengele character \"can knock together a human being out of the unlikeliest odds and ends. On his desk he had a box of eyes. It was not uncommon to see him slipping out of his darkroom carrying a head partly wrapped in old Martin Amlrnie: black Irony newspaper...The next thing you knew, there'd be, oh, I don't know, a 15-year-old Pole sliding off the table...\" Tested crucially in the cli- mactic Auschwitz chapter, the reversal method does begin to falter - not through lack of skill on Amis's part but because the deathcamps' real- ity proves intractable even to this subtle art, whose \"taste- lessness\" is really nothing of the sort. Yet it is the method itself that has brought us so vivid a picture of that reality, while it also allows of an origi- nal and quietly touching solu- tion to the problem of describ- ing the camps and their guilty aftermath, which is simply to wind back the narrative to the point in time before the atroci- ties happened. The doctor-pro- tagonist is restored in the end to innocence as a fact: \"igno- rant and innocent,\" the para- site comments, \"never having known anyone, even Irene, even Rosa, even Herta, even the Jews and the others I made.\" Too relentlessly dispassion- ate to be exactly moving, the novel is more than a tour de force of literary mannerism. Though it strains the eye and makes the head spin (the back- to-front dialogues are particu- larly disorienting), the experi- mental narrative method is genuinely compelling in a way that mannerist devices such as, for instance, John Ashber- y's use of two simultaneous speakers in his long poem Lit- any, seldom are. The book's devastatingly sustained black irony stands comparison with Swift's A Modest Proposal. It is, I think, Amis's finest achieve- ment to date. Paul Driver",

   "text_content" : "T SEEMS a pity that Sir Rupert Hart-Davis's Memoir of his life up to 1946 when he was 39 should not have been published a couple of years ago when we were commemorating the 50th anniver- sary of the outbreak of the second world war. This slim volume is just the book we needed then, a pithy, witty account of how the life of one individual, a representative of the gilded youth of the 1920s, was abruptly and totally changed by the conflict. Yet the book will, surely, give much pleasure, both to those old enough to compare notes with the author, and to those of an age to wonder what ordinary life was like for their grandparents while Nazi Germany was being defeated. Sir Rupert kept a journal intermit- tently and he has managed to retrieve all the letters he wrote to his second wife, Comfort, when she was living in Maine in 1940 with their two children, Bridget and Duff, and he was sweating it out as a recruit to the Brigade of Guards THE POWER OF CHANCE: A MEMOIR by Rupert Hart-Davis Sinlair-Sevenso Â£15.95. 188 pages OLD MEN REMEMBER by William Douglas Home Collins & Brown Â£16.99, 192 pages doing his basic training at the Dep6t at Caterham. He has re-cycled these entertaining letters (minus most of the endearments and references to the children) into this book. It was as a staff captain, aged 35, at Headquarters in London, that part of his duties consisted in signing arrest-warrants for absentee sol- diers. He noticed on one of them the name J. Maclaren-Ross, that of a writer whose first published short story - \"A Bit of A Smash in Madras\" - he had read in Horizon. Maclaren-Ross, a lance-corporal in the infantry based at Southend, had been arrested when he was found in bed with his girlfriend in South Lon- don. Sir Rupert went to investigate. \"I found Julian...and when I was left alone with him he rushed for- ward in a state of great excitement, thrusting a tiny bundle into my hands and saying 'Here are my manuscripts'. With some difficulty I forced them into my greatcoat pock- ets.\" After Sir Rupert had written a letter to Maclaren-Ross's CO, the army psychiatrists decided this NCC should be discharged. Pis first boo TrW Su To Gb The Pips (Cape, 1944) was dedicated to is rescuer. Before the war Sir Rupert left Oxford without a degree, worked I' first as an actor at the Old Vic and then in publishing. The pre-war book world is described, involving charac- ters like William Plomer, Daniel George and Jim Hamilton. He recalls his great friend Peter Fleming to whom, according to his account, he handed over a former girlfriend - Celia Johnson- whom Fleming mar- ried. Then Sir Rupert evokes his own short-lived first marriage to Peggy Ashcroft. These people are the main players in the crowded prelude to his army experience. As a one-time actor Sir Rupert was put in charge of the concert at San- dhurst before the passing-out parade. \"Hard to follow William Douglas-Home [SKM\" he writes to his wife \"who produced a splendid show for the whole company.\" Thre Is no account given in Old Men fmbr of that show nor is there much of significance about any of the other shows, Now Barabbas, The Odtern Hundreds, The Relic- tant Debuftnte, The Secretry Bid, The Kingfisher, with which we asso- ciate this playwright Most of this book consists of anec- dotes, many of them like shove half- pennies worn thin by constant use. They concern members of the author's family including his par- ents, his brothers and sisters, includ- ing his more famous brother Alec, his children, and his wider circle of seemingly innumerable relations and friends. Brian JoMuston gets a whole chapter to himselt It is admir- ing and affectionate but it includes a rather tasteless revelation of the fee he allegedly receives for making afterdinner speeches. The only points - and they are the most interesting ones - where the writer drops the genial manner and engages angrily with his mate- rial are when he is dealing with the domination of left-wing directors and dramatic critics over the theatre, and when he is recalling the episode in 1944 that led to his leaving the army. As an officer taking part in the liberation of France he disobeyed the order to proceed to Le Havre because the German commander of that city had requested a day's reprieve to evacuate all civilians, and this had been refused. William Douglas Home was court martialled, cashiered and sentenced to a year's imprisonment. This harsh punishment gave him the material for his first play. He has been over this ground before but this chapter puts it all very neatly including the latest development in his appeal to have the cashiering quashed. It raises questions which are no less relevant, and awkward to answer now, than they were then. Anthony Cartis",

   "text_content" : "Robertson Davies is clearly a writer who likes to get to the point: his latest book opens with a murder in the very first sentence. To make matters more interesting, the victim turns out to be the narrator of the ensuing novel. Connor Gil- martin, the middle-aged arts editor of a leading Canadian newspaper, is bludgeoned to death by his film critic, Randal Allard Going, after he catches Going at it with his wife. Gil- martin finds himself trans- formed into a walking spirit who possesses sight, hearing and memory, but is invisible to those still alive. After a short spell of bitter confusion, he grows accustomed to his disembodiment and decides to haunt his murderer. So far so good. Davies has efficiently set-up what prom- ises to be a neat voyeuristic satire. But then, quite jar- ringly, he changes course alto- gether, turning Murther & Walking Spirits into a thor- oughly conventional, some- what stodgy historical novel. Gilmartin follows Going to a film festival, intent on causing mischief, though when they enter the theatre something unexpected happens. Gilmartin finds himself watching movies that are far different from what the others behold. He MURTHER & WALKING SPIRITS by Robertson Davies Sinclair-Stevenson Â£14.95, 357 pages soon realises that he is wit- nessing an epic film telling his family history. The action opens in Revolu- tionary War-era New York, where his Loyalist great-great- great-great-Grandmother, Anna Gage, escapes to Canada after the death of her British husband. After this, a new reel is run before our ghosts's eyes, this one narrating the story of his Welsh forebears as they bring themselves up from pov- erty to a position of great wealth, only to undergo the comprehensive ruin that forces them to emigrate to Canada. The film then depicts the two families as they come together, proceeding from the story of Gilmartin's architect great- grandfather, to his newspaper tycoon grandfather, to his col- lege professor father. Through- out, Gilmartin learns things about his ancestors he never suspected, their secrets and deceptions, their disappoint- ments and small triumphs. The film history ends with the auc- tion of his ancestral Welsh home, whereupon the ghost leaves the theatre in order to Robertson Davies facilitate his murderer's moral breakdown. Murther & Walking Spiris is a strange and unsatisfying hybrid, a book in which the attempt to graft a historical saga onto a ghost story withers on the vine. It is certainly con- vincing in parts - the initial ghostly awe of the murder vic- tim is believable, and at times the historical narrative takes on an impressive sweep, such murderer's moral Walking Spirils is and unsatisfying ~ok in which the graft a historical :host story withers It is certainly con- arts - the initial of the murder vic- able, and at times II narrative takes ssive sweep, such :I~:: as during Anna Gage's escape from besieged New York, or the attempts by the opium-rav- aged great-grandfather to build a great cathedral in the Cana- dian boon docks. Other sequences are far less success- ful, such as a stab at Joycean stream-of-consciousness involv- ing the narrator's embittered grandparents and his lovelorn father as they sit sullenly around a fire, or a silly scene in which Gilmartin's widow conspires with her unctuous agent to write an exploitative book about her husband's death. And the ending seems downright perfunctory, with a strange metaphysical dialogue between the narrator and his \"feminine other\" that bears lit- tle reference to the preceding pages. The novel's real problem, however, is that Davies never convinces us how these dispa- rate elements should hang together. The early switch in tone and scope throws the book hopelessly off course. Davies clearly has a story to tell, and a seemingly personal one at that. He just has not figured out how to tell it. With a more careful structuring, the Gilmartins' history might have been compelling. As is, it is no more interesting than looking at some stranger's family tree. Stephen Amidon",

   "text_content" : "F RANCES Harris's book is aptly titled. The passion which dominated Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough throughout her long life was her desire to wield political influence. To be a courtier, the richest woman of her times, favourite of Queen Anne, was simply not enough. Sarah's political ambition and efforts to champion the Whigs against the detested \"Torrys\" ultimately ruined her relations with Queen Anne. Whenever Sarah felt she might retire from active lobbying, she was prevented by the Whigs, who regarded her as their only supporter close to the Queen. Ironically, they continued to believe Sarah was influential long after her relationship with Anne had soured. The life of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, has been written before. But, as Curator of the Manuscript Collection in the British Library, Dr Harris has drawn even more extensively A PASSION FOR GOVERNMENT:THE LIFE OF SARAH, DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH by Frances Harris Clarendon Press, Oxford Â£25, 421 pages on primary sources, especially the Blenheim Papers, which went to the British Library as part settlement of death duties following the 10th Duke's death in 1972. Quotations from Sarah's correspondence with the Queen and love letters to the Duke give the narrative immediacy and poignancy. Sarah emerges as a girl typi- cal of her class: \"pretty daugh- ters of minor courtiers and gentry, whose families were prepared to risk their chastity at the disreputable Restoration court in the hope of attracting better matches for them than they might otherwise have hoped for.\" Sarah was fortu- nate; sent to Court \"extream young\" at the age of 13, as a Maid of Honour, she fell in love with John Churchill, an ambi- tious soldier who remained devoted to her throughout their long married life together. But it was her intimate rela- tionship with Anne which most benefited both Sarah and her husband. \"It is already clear at this point [1687] how much the special relationship with Anne, on which Chur- chill's whole future career was to be built, owed to his wife's position,\" writes Harris. When finally Anne became Queen, the Marlboroughs, as they had become, were able to reap the rewards of their longstanding friendship. But, in Sarah's case, not the political influence she so earnestly wanted. The, story is clearly not of our times; blatant patronage and nepotism are a phenome- non of the past. So too is the fragility of life which gave such importance to the need for sons and heirs. The con- stant obsession of women to produce children runs as a sub- theme throughout the book, profoundly affecting political and social events. Sarah's life runs parallel to the history of early 18th cen- tury England. The author assumes at least a rudimentary awareness of current events. The general reader may find Harris's detailed narrative rather overwhelming. There is no historical outline in which to place Marlborough's many expeditions abroad. A map of Europe and a royal family tree might have given greater clar- ity to the text. Victoria Schofield",

   "text_content" : "HOW FAR has he gone? Six novels back, Finbar, the priest in David Lodge's The British Museum Is Falling Down, hurtles along the Edgware Road screaming about contraceptives to a conscience-pricked graduate. In this latest work, the priest is hero: lapsed believer, scandal-rouser in his parish, shambling naif in the rowdy secular world. Paradise News is a 1990s update on Lodge's Catholic comedies The British Museum (1965) and How Far Can You Go? (1980), in which familiar Lodge themes - doubt, conscience, honesty versus self-advancement - glitter in a new constellation: Hawaii instead of Rummidge, holidays instead of work, theology instead of sin and rules. Ex-priest Bernard Walsh escorts his father to see a dying aunt in Waikiki. Within minutes of arriving, father is run down by a car, Bernard embroiled in an affair with its driver, relatives pop up all over the beach and holiday-makers are farcically deconstructing Paradise. Honeymoons go sour, gay companion instead of daughter-in-law shows up at the airport, every girl's Mr Nice turns into Mr Spoilsport. Through trial and temptation, can Bernard stay an honest man? The two views of Paradise - Bernard's spiritual quest and the material one that forms its comic backdrop - pull together through a typical Lodge jet-setter, the \"tourist\" for whom holidays are religion, PARADISE NEWS by David Lodge Secker & Warburg Â£14.99, 294 pages package trip pilgrimage, swimming pool baptism. Theory runs riot with the plot; multiple perspectives define class, sex and age with stinging precision; old favourites are topically recast - Nice Work's entrepreneur Brian Everthorpe as victim of the recession, for example. Beyond each small scene, the wide-angled lens homes in on trends, signs, symbols. But - how far does it go? Paradise News is amusing, accessible, intelligent, a natural successor in guilty sex and doctrinal doubt to early Lodge novels while breezily picking up social commentary where his last one, Nice Work (1988) left off. Yet with its melde of interests and busy plot, it is somehow the lesser work. Overcrowded with people, themes, ideas, it bulges out like a disorderly bus unsure of its route. Lodge's unique satirical gift is to turn dry literary theory to dazzling fictional effect, decoding life through the language and structures - from advertisements to families or airplanes - that we take for granted. His are among the rare modern English novels where form gives as much pleasure as content: the literary parodies which edge along the plot of The British Museum... while reflecting its hero's grappling with art and reality; Nice Work jokily modelled on the Victorian condition-of-England novel even as it dissects \"Victorian values\" in Thatcherite culture. But in the holiday world of Paradise News Lodge is as ill-at-ease as his scholarly hero. Always the teacher, his flimsy hold on his new subject cramps his style; we expect ideas and arguments thrown out as jokes or parodies; we find flat, sober expositions which appear to include every fact Lodge has researched about the sociology of tourism. Paradise News is written with Lodge's usual assurance but without experimental flair. The plot works repeatedly through disappointed holiday hopes, with none of the spiralling coincidences of true farce. Child abuse is clumsily introduced and dismissed, almost as another bid for topicality. Interwoven first ana uur person narranves - Bernard's life story versus Hawaiian jolification - do not cohere; literary quotation and theological debate float freely and uncertainly. Names are ordinary - Yolande Miller, Russ Harvey, Sidney, Sue, Dee; Small World's cast of Morris Zapp and Phillip Swallow, Desiree and Angelica, are more real even as one is reading the present novel. And yet... Lodge, like all good novelists, celebrates the everyday careful observation of detail, character close-ups, the broad scope of humanity. For all his satirical vigour, he is among our most generous writers. Who else could make the tiresome fool scavenging other travellers' cellophane butter and cheese a winning and comprehensble character? Or convincingly turn a fost-bitten bride into a tender lover? PAadise New is not his most artful reamtion, but the story rolls the spark fly. Jackie Wllschfager",

   "text_content" : "\"YOU'RE NOT going to resign over giving the prize to Anita Brookner, are you?\" That was what my fellow Booker Judge, John Fuller, said to me on that memorable evening in October 1984. It was around six o'clock; the dinner was due to start at 7.30. We still had to decide on the winner, change into black tie and have our private pre- liminary drink with Booker's chairman, Sir Michael Caine. We - viz. Richard Cobb (our chairman), Ted Rowlands MP, Polly Devlin, Fuller and myself - were incommunicado in the Booker Boardroom We had been there for several hours. A gaggle of reporters was waiting outside for the white puff of smoke. Transport was standing by to take us to the Guildhall. Rarely do literary critics expe- rience such a sense of power. I had been holding out for David Lodge's Small World which I thought - still think - in a different league from the other five books on the short list. Rowlands was for Empire of the Sun. Flaubert's Parrot, Anita Desai's In Cus- tody, and According to Mark, the novel of a later winner Penelope Lively, were out of the running. Cobb, Fuller, and Devlin were now all solidly behind Brookner. I had a choice before me - either to resign and dissociate myself from the final decision, or to rehearse yet again the merits of Lodge to the others, filibustering right up to dinner- time in the hope that hunger would win me sufficient con- verts; or to agree we should give the prize to Hotel du Lac. I chose the latter course and so did Rowlands. It seems to me that if you become a judge of something so hazardous as the Booker, there does come a moment at the end of the day when you have to accept the majority verdict, provided you do not feel that you are giving the prize to a novel that is unwor- thy of it. Any of the books on our short list was in my view worthy of it. It was not that I did not think Hotel du Lac a good novel well worth reading. I just h'ppepd to think Small World a'=t,1one. But w qes the word bet- ter meahlfr you are dealing with novel byfferent writers with utterlyd'ifferent aims? The questioAn .veals the inher- ent absurdity'of such a Prize, which can 6ni be justified as a publicity exercise for the art of the novel. The truth is that novels are not like athletes competing in a race where you can take out a stop-watch and Should one resign or not? asks Anthony Curtis This year's Booker Prize shortlist: TIME'S ARROW by Martin Amis (Cape, Â£13.99) THE VAN by Roddy Doyle (SECKER & WARBURG, Â£13.99) SUCH A LONG JOURNEY by Rohinton Mistry (Saber,Â£13.99) THE REDUNDANCY OF COURAGE by Timothy Mo (Chatto & Windus,Â£13.99) THE FAMISHED ROAD by Ben Okri (Cape,Â£13.99) READING TURGENEV (from TWO LIVES) by William Trevor (Viking,Â£13.99) The winner will be chosen and announced on October 22. measure who performs best. Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbevilles, Gissing's New Grub Street and Kipling's The Light That Failed were all published in 1891 and should all have been on the short-list had such a thing existed then. Which was \"best\"? The case of Nicholas Mosley, one of this year's judges who has resigned four weeks before that last pre-dinner judging session, is an unusual one. Apparently he does not regard any of the six books short- listed as worthy of the prize. Here again - in the composi- tion of the Booker short-list - there is a large element of casi- no-like absurdity. The art of novel-writing flourishes to such an extent that it would be perfectly possible for the judges to compile two com- pletely different short-lists, both equally valid, from the 150 or more novels submitted In our year, for instance, we had to consider and reject nov- els by William Golding, Amis pire and fils, Dan Jacobson, Caroline Blackwood, Alan Massie, Thomas Keneally, Wil- liam Boyd, Angela Carter, Andr6 Brink, and several more out of which we could have easily made an alternative short list at which no one would have batted an eyelid. Even at this preliminary junc- ture - when the judges have the invidious task of singling out the lucky six - each of the judges will have one or more personal favourites that he or she has reluctantly to surren- der to the majority verdict. Ted Rowlands, I remember, was a solitary champion of Dirk Bogarde's West of Sunset Rowlands did not resign over Bogarde. Mosley has resigned over the omission of Alan Massie's The Sins of the Father. In giving his reason in the press he has sought to occupy high moral ground for this novel and for novel-writing. His argument is that besides the seriousness of Massie's novel - it concerns the impli- cations of the Holocaust for us all .- the ones chosen by his fellow-judges do little more than \"remark on human quaintness\". Time may vindi- cate him. Massie's novel may still be read and pondered when those up for this year's prize are forgotten. But even if that were so, Mosley's princi- ple is a dangerous one when applied to the judging of sic- tion. I believe that the Holo- caust is something we should never be allowed to forget; but I reserve the right to read, enjoy, praise, and even on occasion call great, novels in which it plays no part."

   "text_content" : "DWARD VII, con- demned before his accession to a regime of stultifying idleness, and insulated by his parents from what they considered noxious influences, was none- theless endowed with a resil- ience and joie de vivre that nullified their anxious improv- ing efforts. Deprived of any useful role in his mother's gov- ernment, or even much infor- mation about its functioning, he strenuously pursued plea- sures, home and abroad, in town or in the country, all a distinct strain on his income, of which nearly half had to be voted by a Parliament sceptical both of his prudence and use. fulness. Edward sought solace in a circle of new friends, many of them Jewish, who included members of the Rothschild family, the Sassoons, and fabu- lously wealthy individual entrepreneurs such as Baron Maurice de Hirsch and Sir Ernest Cassel, known in his day as \"Windsor Cassel', both of whom functioned discreetly and loyally as personal invest- ment advisors to the Prince and later King. These royal friendships often began casu- ally at house parties or race meetings, and ripened with the gift of lavish hospitality: a Prince bored with rigid Court protocol relished dining out in private houses, particularly those furnished with elegant hostesses and the most exqui- site cuisine, wines and cigars. Cosmopolitan and quick-wit- ted, Edward's Jewish friends and their wives were know- ledgeable about international politics and markets, the Turf, even exotic garden plants, and Edward unabashedly enjoyed eating, gambling, sailing, shooting and fishing in their company. The Jewish mag- nates were, moreover, exceed- ingly generous, not merely to the Prince, who barely made ends meet on his Â£100,000 per year, but to his favourite chari- ties. The ascent of these Court Jews was rapid but not invariably smooth: members of the aris- EDWARD VII AND HIS JEWISH COURT by Anthony Aifrey Weidenfeld & Nicolson Â£19.99, 321 pages tocracy and others observed their rise with resentment and envy, expressed in a fashion- able salon anti-Semitism that was never uttered in Edward's presence but had its resonance in certain drawing rooms. The author of this study also per- Sir Enest Camel, nicknamed 'Windsor Cassel' mits himself an occasional sneer one of the Sassoons, a \"dusky nabob, studded with outsize pearls\", is depicted as \"insinuating his way to the card tables in the Marlborough Club and to the notice of the Prince\"; all three Sassoons \"sidled casually and impercep- tibly into royal favour\"; the overwhelmingly luxurious houses, tables and entertain- ments are described with faint distaste. But Anthony Allfrey is more frequently laudatory, com- menting on the bold astuteness of Hirsch and Cassel's business ventures, the genuine mutual affection that bound them to Edward VI, and their high eth- ical standards: of them, the Rothschilds and other Jews in the King's circle he writes \"they never abused the power of their deep pockets. There was no breath of scandal or hint of sharp practice. This set them apart.\" That these were no ordinary men, and their friendship with the King was genuinely felt on both sides, emerges from a wealth of detail, some of it quarried from the Royal Archives and the surviving Cassel papers. There are however signifi- cant gaps: the special account that Cassel kept of the King's investments \"has perished\", as apparently have many of the papers recording Cassel's own vast enterprises, ranging from Egyptian banking and agricul- tural schemes to Balkan rail- ways. We are afforded one tan- talising glimpse of Edward's own trading: writing to Cassel on June 1, 1902, the King says, \"You will doubtless have heard that Peace is signed.. 'Con- sols' are sure to go up tomor- row. Could you not make a large investment for me?\" The King adds disarmingly \"It is to be hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may announce on Wednesday not to put the extra pence on the Income Tax...\" - having been informed of the Chancellor's Budget proposals at least 24 hours before these were announced to the public. There is much more we should like to know about Edward VII's investments and their manage- ment; not least to what extent, If at all, Cassel made loans or gifts of money to his sovereign, or reimbursed his investment losses. Despite helpful genealogical tables sorting out Rothachilds, Bischoffsheims and Gold- schmidts, and the Cassels, who included Edwina, Countess Mountbatten, readers unfamil- iar with the enmeshed com- plexities of Edwardian society are likely to go astray amid the thick impasto of Allrey's nar- rative. Moreover, his evident inability to forego even one backstairs detail or namedrop- ping anecdote, however imma- terial to his main story - an excursus on Derby winners in the mileof a discussion on Chinese loans, another on the fate of General Boulanger's hore Tunis - becomes at last wearisome. Despite its occasional tone of servants' hall gossip, Airey's book is wOrthzrehiwi shed- ding faht oar s fn t Zda tiomsips in the i of Edwad VII that have been mintised or neglected by biographers amd historians relactant for a arAty reaso to ahnowl- nge of Jew at the pinmacle of imwaran socdety.

   "text_content" : "Before next month's Hayward Gallery exhibition, Nicholas Woodsworth goes back to Henri's roots LMOST ALL of France's cele- brated painters, it seems, are attached to a landscape,t0o a geography they have made their own- The angular bulk of Mont iVic- toire becao- part of 's personallt, as.did G Monet, or ihe. str*ets martre 'for Utrillo. . 6 Impressionists paint e Seine at Argenteuil an Gogh adopted the olive es of Provence, it is becau rt- ists are no different from people: they respond the nee to belong, to make .m- selves part of 4ie world ibat surrounds them. What, then, of one of France's most perceptive-*rt- ists, an extraordinary fig-tii who rejected an attachmentto physical surroundings for the exploration of the further lim- its of human geography? Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was not a painter of the landscapes and life to which he was born. Instead he spent the most cre- ative part of his short exis- tence depicting the complex topography of human nature in some of its most pronounced and unguarded forms. If Lau- trec was willing to acknowl- edge the significance of place anywhere, it was in the caba- rets, bars and brothels of Mont- martre. It was here he came close to his raw material, the demi- monde of turn-of-the-century Paris - acrobats and drunks, dancers and prostitutes, box- ers, society dandies, jockeys, pimps and wayward English- men. \"Only the figure exists\", Lautrec insisted. \"Landscape should only be used to make the nature of a figure under- standable.\" In the grotesque forms and characters of Mont- martre, Lautrec could find some understanding of that one figure, dwarfish and ugly, which pre-occupied him most - his own. Montmartre was not Lau- trec's natural world. It killed him, alcoholic, syphilitic and exhausted, at the age of 36. He came from a far different world, a place where he might have fitted happily into calm rural landscapes and a tradi- tional social order. Why did he exchange it for a turbulent and self- destructive life? Travel south from Paris across the Massif Central, to the sunny valleys of Languedoc, and still today you can find traces of the fateful twists of his early life. The stone turrets and slate roofs of the Chateau du Bosc, one of numerous family homes in which Lautrec grew up, overlook hilly country about half an hour's drive from the pink, brick-built town of Albi. Even a short stroll about leaves no doubt that this is a countryside in which the Toul- ouse-Lautrecs had their appointed place. The diminutive, elderly woman who opens the gates to visitors here, Nicole Tapie de Celeyran, is not a terribly close relative of the painter's - her great-great-grandmother, Louise, was Lautrec's grand- mother; her grandfather, Raoul, was one of 14 of Lau- trec's cousins, and spent child- hood summers with him. But sit with this proud, energetic woman for half an hour and you will see that tracing the complex family history of recent generations is child's play for her - this is a clan that has jealously watched over its aristocratic lineage in Languedoc for more than 800 years. Madame Tapie de Celeyran will lead you past hanging tap- estries, vast fireplaces and softly gleaming wood to one of the most cherished objects in the chAteau - a framed genea- logical chart. At the top is the name of Baudoin, son of Ray- mond V, Count of Toulouse, who in 1196 married Alise de Lautrec. At the bottom, born in 1864, is the last member of the house of the Counts of Toul- ouse, Henri de Toulouse-Lau- trec. In between, as Madame Tapie de Celeyran will tell you, is a great deal of blue blood. The Counts of Toulouse were always the noblest among noble families. Present at the crowning of Charlemagne, they long held independent rule over much of southern France. Their prowess as decisive lead- ers and enthusiastic warriors was the stuff of which trouba- dours made poetry. In later centuries, after subjugation by the kings of France, they turned their considerable ener- gies to more pacific pursuits - hunting, horsemanship, fal- conry, and the safeguarding of the purity of the family blood. Long centuries of such life have worked different influ- ences on different family mem- bers. Madame Tapie de Celeyran, for example, is an ardent royalist. As she decribes Henri's sketch of his father and uncles returning home Lautrec's childhood at the chiteau, her constantly gesti- culating arm displays a fleur- de-lys-decorated wrist-watch that reads \"Dieu et Mon Rol\". It may be a long shot, but she is dedicated to putting a Bour- bon king back on a French throne. The pages of history, she firmly maintains, can and should be turned back. A harkening back to a glori- ous, more noble past seems to have been in the make-up of all the family members. In Count Alphonse Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri's father, it was so marked that it appeared as wild eccentricity. What can one say of a man who took morning rides through the Bois de Boulogne in the dress of a Cossack horseman, stop- ping only to milk his mare and enjoy breakfast before the eyes of astonished Parisians? Alphonse, passionate about hunting and the sporting life, carried medieval fantasy to new and unimagined heights. At home in quiet, conserva- tive Albi, he strolled though town with a falcon on his wrist. Sometimes he would pitch a huge tent on the square in front of the cathedral there, saying he preferred it to his elegant townhouse only a stone's-throw away. And when he was in his home, he some- times barricaded himself in the tall tower overlooking Albi's ramparts, \"to be closer to the birds\", and had meals swung up on a pulley. Alphonse was never happier than when dressing up as a Kirghiz chief, a Canadian trapper, or a kilted Scots highlander. Unconventional as it might have been, Lautrec moved in this atmosphere as to the man- ner born. He rode with his The eccentric Pape Lautrec In one of his favourite costumes father, sketched scenes of war- riors, horses and the hunt with his uncle Charles, played with cousins at Bosc, and moved from one family home to another as his father followed his whims and his hunting dogs. He had inherited wealth, social elevation, and the rural pursuits of a proud, if some- what peculiar, noble line. He might have settled into a life of happy obscurity in the coun- tryside had it not been for one further, devastating inheri- tance. One of the most touching curiosities Madame Tapie Celeyran shows her visitors is an upstairs wall on which the height of various family mem- bers was regularly measured and pencilled as they grew up. Henri's is the most notable. Until the age of 14, the record is quite normal; after that, the marks grow closer and closer, and finally stop altogether at a little under five feet. Lautrec was almost certainly a victim of pyknodysostosis, a disease resulting in dwarfism and often associated with fam- ily in-breeding. Such a practice had been common among the Toulouse-Lautrecs for centu- ries. Lautrec's grandmothers were sisters, his parents were first cousins; his paternal uncle married his maternal aunt, producing a number of birth-defective children. From adolescence onwards, Lautrec was to pay a heavy price for the purity of his bloodline. After two accidents in his mid-teens, the result of decalcified bones, his legs ceased to grow. Other symp- toms of the disease developed - thick, protuberant lips, a receding chin, enlarged nos- trils, and an oversized tongue that made Lautrec lisp and sal- ivate heavily. A future that had seemed solid and assured vanished. Henri was not proud and hand- some like his fathers and uncles, could not ride and hunt like them, or grace a table with the dignified Toulouse-Lautrec bearing. For those seeing him for the first time, he was a bizarre object of curiosity. For those more intimately involved, he became to all but his mother a disappointment and a misfit. In the insular world of a traditional country aristocracy, such a figure stood little chance of making much sense of his life. Did Henri de Toulouse-Lau- trec stand a greater chance anywhere else? It would not, on the face of it, seem likely, and his decision to pursue an artistic career under the lurid gaze of bordello and music hall patrons was courageous. His existence in Montmartre was painful and unhappy, his pro- ductive life an unending search for some sort of inner truth beyond the instability, indig- nity and deformation of the outer world. That Lautrec lost his way in the familiar terrain of rural Languedoc was his personal tragedy. The determi- nation to find it, to make him- self part of the world again in a night-time landscape far away, was his making as an artist.",

   "text_content" : "N ICHOLAS Maw's Odyssey is exactly the kind of massive, complex orchestral score that deserves the close study a recording offers, and which so frequently fails to attract the attention of the record companies. Doubtless Simon Rattle's involvement has persuaded EMI to bite the bullet this time and they have done the piece proud, lacing together two concert perfor- mances from Birmingham Town Hall to produce a first-rate, compelling version. The recording may not be as detailed and refined as it would have been under ideal studio conditions, but the sheer sweep of the perfor- mance and the luminous inten- sity with which every line is invested are more than ade- quate compensation. Inevitably though Odyssey remains problematic. A 95-min- ute span of orchestral music, however tightly integrated the- matically, is going to have its longueurs, and a few persist despite the small cuts that have been made in the score here. The sheer length of the central intermezzo seems the main difficulty; it's the one sec- tion in which Maw's powers of melodic invention fail him. But that music constitutes only 12 minutes out of the whole edi- fice, and Rattle and the CBSO make everything else cohere in a way that neither the incom- plete Proms performance in 1987 nor the complete version at the Festival Hall 18 months later quite managed. The slow movement, half an hour long, is Odyssey's greatest glory, but the mounting tensions of the finale and its tumultuous coda offer a refashioned view of late- 19th century rhetoric that is searching and unique. Colin Matthews was briefly a pupil of Maw, but his music has gone on to subsume a much wider variety of influ- ences. The Great Journey was perhaps his most ambitious and significant work of the 1980s, a setting for baritone and eight instruments of the report of the conquistador Alvar Nunez Cabesa de Vaca on his travels though the New World. Somewhere in the work's deep past is surely a memory of Henne's \"diary of a runaway slave\", B CAmuarms; nerer the sufac te are hOs neww the surfam we echoes Maw: Odyssey.

But Matthews's methods are quieter and less flamboyant. The Great Journey works from the outside in as it were, as this trip though an unimagined alien land becomes a voyage of self-discovery, and the brutal repressor who set out from Spain returns misunderstood to a traitor's welcome and imprisonment. The performance by David Wilson-Johnson as the narra- tor, is a masterly one, by turns impassioned and phlegmatic, and the instrumental details are etched with great elo- quence by the Nash Ensemble. The remainder of the disc - Fuga, an instrumental version of part 3 of The Great Journey which serves as a reminder that Matthews is a master of the rarest art in contemporary music, the ability to write fast music, and the exquisite set- ting of Pessoa's sonnet Night's Mask - makes this the most valuable survey on record so far of Matthews's music. The three concertos by Poul Ruders brought together by Unicorn-Kanchana at last give British listeners an introduc- tion to one of the most distinc- tive of younger European voices and the most consider- able Danish composer since Nielsen. There are in fact ech- oes of Ruders's forebear In at least one of the concertos here: the irascible clarinet in the 1985 work with \"twin-orches- tra\" recalls Nielsen's own solo writing for the instrument, while Ruder's idea of concerto soloists as protagonists in a human drama suggested in the cello work might also be traced back to the same source. Ruders is, though, hard to categorise. The First Violin Concerto's neo-baroque figura- tions might suggest affiliations with Arvo PArt's two-violin Tabula Rasa, and to British ears links with Tippett's Cor- elli Fantasia, but the Clarinet and Cello Concertos inhabit a much freer post-modernist, world with links to late-roman- ticism and with emotional pressures of expressionist intensity. It may well be that Ruders will metamorphose eventually into a Scandinavian symphonist - his first sym- phony was one of the hits of the 1990 Proms - but he is never likely to be just another example of that tired genre; he will be a hugely distinctive and, one suspects, influential figure in contemporary music over the next 20 years. For sheer, unshamed exuber- ance and high-intensity physi- cal attack Louis Andriessen's De Stoat deserves full marks and a brief, excited welcome: it represents European minimal- ism at its liveliest and most abrasively attractive. Though the 35-minute piece comes com- plete with an array of political baggage, with choral settings of sections of Plato's Republic embedded in the score, it oper- ates most convincingly on a basic physical level. There is a good deal of Stravinsky's Rite in the rhythmic attacks and wind chording, elements of big- band jazz and be-bop too. Most of all there is the sheer delight in the sound world and the noise it can muster. Played at full volume it can do wonders for the spirits. Andrew Clements",

   "text_content" : "one goes out. It seems reason- able to us, for the whole town appears to be up and about. On Oxford Road patrons are leav- ing the cinemas and filling the chip shops, draining from the pubs and queueing outside dis- cotheques. Do I want maximum Man- chester, my companion wants to know, or would a regular- people's-night-out place do? I am not sure I am ready for maximum Manchester, so we opt for the Discotheque Royale. The Royale is youngish and respectable, a middle-class sort of place just down of up- market, where the bouncers are required to wear jackets and ties and be polite. Jackets and ties are mandatory for everyone, except the women, who wear white stiletto heels and suspend small evening bags from their shoulders. Few people actually wear this gear once they are through the door. Inside, it is about 80'F, sweaty and very loud. The men remove their jackets, roll up their sleeves and eye the dance-floor as they buy pints. The women place their bags in neat little piles on the floor and dance over them, two or three at a time, to pre- vent them being nicked. But this is not a bored subur- ban dance hall crowd killing time on one more blowsy Fri- day night. These are Mancu- nians and they are here to dance - there is more energy in this relatively staid disco- theque than in most generat- ing stations. The place is packed and jumping, all three ornately-tiered balconies of it. In front of long bars on every level, customers are thirsty and three thick. On the dance floor, exuberant bodies move to a heavy base rhythm that sets the close air vibrat- ing. At each end of the floor, on raised platforms, two frenet- ically dancing girls in skimpy aerobic outfits and designer trainers - the Royale's version of 1960's go-go girls - are mak- ing Jane Fonda look dull. \"What's the music?,\" I bel- low into my companion's ear as we drink bitter and watch two men in grey suits shake and shimmy together. On my third try she hears the ques- tion. \"Manchester sound,\" she bellows back. My ears are ring- ing. Manchester sound is big. Manchester has been many things over the years. Hard- working, innovative, entrepre- neurial, it became the third biggest port in the British empire, never letting the fact that it was 40 miles inland bother it. Here, as the guide- books will tell you, the atom was first split, the commercial computer was first developed, and the world's first test-tube baby born. Novelist Elizabeth Gaskell called it \"dear, old, dull, ugly, smokey, grey, grim Manchester.\" The painter L S Lowry said the same thing on canvas. To the cotton kings of the 19th century it was a pot of gold, to the industrial lumpen- proletariat a well of chronic poverty. Little is left of the world in which Manchester built its rep- utation. The great cotton mills and warehouses have become converted entertainment ven- ues, the terraced houses mod- els for sets of Coronation Stree. What is left, however, is the energy, the sheer spirit that made Manchester one of the great power-houses of the industrial age. And while that age is gone, Manchester is once again picking up steam. Which city, against the odds, won the right to launch Britain's bid to host the Olympic games in 2000? Not London, but Man- chester. No stranger to economic dif- ficulty, the city shares the problems of many other urban centres in Britain. But there is an energy here that does much to counterbalance recession and social distress. It is visible in local industry and services, in new communications net- works, in urban redevelop- ment, in the fast-growing edu- cational sector, in municipally-sponsored cultural initiatives. It is most visible of all, how- ever, in that area least suspep- > tible to discipline or organisa- tion of any kind - in the spontaneous culture and dyna- i mism of young Mancunians. i Knock about the streets, clubs, and pubs of Manchester for a r weekend, doing the ordinary i things that young people do, and you cannot fail to see it. My companion has not i returned to Manchester from London for a few months, and wants to see how northern fashion is getting on. The fash- ions that evolve on the streets of Manchester, she tells me, end up in the boutiques of Lon- * don. So off we marched i through Saturday morning i crowds across Piccadilly [ square to Affleck's Palace, i once a Victorian warehouse - now an alternative fashion cen- tre selling streetwise style. \"Watch for the flared trou- sers, hooded tops and wallabies,\" my companion tells i me. Such are the things, appar- ently, that cut ice in Manches- ter. But styles change fast. To -my companion's discomfort, we find not the slightest sign of flares or hooded tops. Floral shirts and bright prints seem to be the hot items. We settle instead for a T-shirt that said: \"And on the sixth day God cre- ated MANchester.\" SON We Walk. In the centre of town we see styles, not sartorial but architectural, that have not changed since bourgeois pros- perity and civic pride adopted them 100 years ago. The buildings are magiste. rial. Manchester, proclaims the Free Trade Hall, the Albert memorial, the neo-gothic town hall, the cathedral, the elabo- rate brick and wrought-iron facades of King Street, is a sub- stantial place. In the Royal Exchange, built in 1874 as the cotton market's trading floor and a supreme piece of Victo- rian self-confidence, we gaze up at the old exchange quota- tion board, still showing prices on the last day of trading. The exchange, like the empire, did not last forever; it ground to a halt in the 1930s. We walk further. Manches- ter's post-imperial ride has not been a smooth one. In Sham- bles Square, on Market Street, around Piccadilly, there are some atrocious buildings. They went up in the 1960s, at about the same time as the Berlin Wall, and might as well have been designed for the wrong side of it. But acres of Victo- rian brick - factories, mills, warehouses - once abandoned and the symbol of decay, now win the day in this city. Urban planners have kept the indus- trial architecture of the past and are putting it to pleasing use. Docklands-type renovation will make this a truly remark- able city one day. U.. My companion's feet begin to complain, so in the afternoon we drive around areas outside the city centre. They do not have to wait for the future; for one reason or another they are remarkable just as they are. In Moss Side we cruise by towers and housing develop- ments where drug wars and organised crime are the order of the day, every day. In Traf- ford Park, by the Manchester ship canal, we drive through one of the largest industrial parks in Europe. At Salford Quays, which is decked out with new gas lamp-posts and antique residences built yester- day, we see bright suburbia bloom where all that Lowry saw was dark and satanic. Around Maine Road, home of Manchester City football team, we drive through working class precincts that still look like Coronation Street. And in Rusholme, the heart of Asian Manchester, we eat a curry that makes me think the Empire was not such a bad thing after all. That evening we went to the Hacienda, the city's bete noir but maximum Manchester nonetheless. I' think people rave most of the time anyway, but if the dancing, communal identification aild general exu- berance that has in Manches- ter come to be known as raving needs a venue, this one at least is legal. What do you say to the pros- pect of 600-700 people dancing frantically on the shop floor of an old factory - in groups, in couples, with the same sex, with the opposite, by them- selves or in any other variation but dancing for three or four hours without the slightest break? I say I am getting old. Either that, or they are on something I am not. At any rate I find the whole thing a little too much. So much too much, in fact, that I find it tiresome and in the small hours begin to yearn for something more interest- ing, like mushy peas. In the Station Chippie, a type of establishment as proudly Mancunian and lon- ger-lived than the Hacienda, we are served little cardboard containers of chips and mushy peas, and eat them with minia- ture wooden forks on the street outside. Mushy peas are good. If there is room for youthful energy, innovation and enter- prise in the New North, there is room for mushy peas as well. My companion, in fact, was not far wrong. Travel Information Rail Fares: From London Euston to Manchester: Â£77 second-class return (no restrictions); Â£31 Supersaver return (restrictions: not Friday or Saturday, not before 9am and not between 4.30pm-6pm). Air Fares: British Airways (London tel: 081-897-4000) has a Heathrow-Manchester Saver fare of Â£45 return (valid until October 26; must include Saturday night stopover), an APEX fare of Â£85 return (booking 14 days in advance), and a full economy return for Â£162. Dan Air (tel: 0345-100200) charges Â£50 for an off-peak return, Â£81 APEX return and Â£160 full economy, from Gatwick to Manchester. Travel News THE WORST, yearfTr the hotel industry is cohtinuing for some - hotel bankruptcies are still increasing - while others report that recovery is seemingly underway. The 60-room Lygon Arms hotel in Broadway, Worcestershire, for example, is one of a number of provincial country house hotels which says that business is better than expected. Kirk Ritchie, managing director of the Lygon, says bookings in August were better than the year before. It is clear that well-run, established country hotels are surviving the recession much better than those which were set up on the wave of the 1980s consumer boom. Bob Payton's Stapleford Park hotel, for example, is a prime example of this genre: in 1989 it won the Good Hotel Guide's award for the most exciting newcomer with its over-the-top decor. Now the hotel is up for sale. This year's guide, edited by Hilary Rubenstein and published this week, has-no similar award, although the Old Rectory in Campsea Ashe , Suffolk, wins an accolade \"for utterly acceptable mild eccentricity.\" Rubenstein's guide is in direct competition with the Consumers' Association's Which? Hotel Guide, also published this week, and first launched last year after Rubenstein and the association fell out. Both are reluctant to name their best hotel of all. The Which? Hotel Guide relies on picking one hotel - \"that had particularly caught our eye\" - from most (but not all) counties in England, Scotland and Wales as well as the Channel Islands. Durrants hotel in George Street, London, for example is singled out as the top capital hotel - ahead of the Savoy and Connaught. The Good Hotel Guide has a comprehensive list of 'special' hotels for readers but also awards several Cesars (after celebrated hotelier Cesar Ritz). Country house hotel of the year in this category is Knockinaam Lodge, in Portpatrick, Scotland. Good Hotel Guide 1992, edited by Hilary Rubenstein, Macmillan, Â£13.99. Which?

   "text_content" : "David Churchill on the way tour operators are responding to changes in demand Holidays earlier this month launched its 17 new holiday brochures for next year it drew attention to the way demand for holidays has changed: some six out of every ten Thomson holidays on sale next year will be specialist, long-haul or city break holi- days, far removed from the tra- ditional sun-and-sand deals to Mediterranean resorts which have formed the bulk of Thom- son's package operations. Two weeks in Cuba starting at around Â£500 per person is the sort of deal Thomson is offering - which is opening up the world to Britons weaned on Mediterranean packages but now looking for something very different. The inclusion of Cuba in the Thomson brochures reflects just how far the long-haul spe- cialist market has changed. Cuba's growing popularity - perhaps because it is an anach- ronism at a time when Com- munist-run states are unfash- ionable - would normally only have attracted specialist tour companies (and indeed has in several brochures just pub- lished). Thomson's decision to sell holidays there emphasises that such places have now come into the mainstream. While short-haul holidays form the backbone of the travel trade, it is the specialist, often long-haul sector, where growth and higher profit mar- gins are to be found. Not surprisingly, tour opera- tors are targetting their deals at the more affluent middle- aged market (with savings, low mortgages, and children leav- ing home) who have consider- able travel expertise and are increasingly looking for new experiences from their travel. These well-heeled travellers, less affected by the recession, have shrugged off their fear of flying caused by the Gulf War. Its feared impact on international travel - a terrorist reprisal or anti-western backlash in some countries - has not materialised. What clearly has also helped the market recover has been operators' determination to widen the scope of holidays on offer as well as keep prices well in line with inflation. Kuoni, for example, has identified ten \"best buys\" In its 1992 world-wide brochure - holidays which offer value for money in popular destinations suited to travellers who are new to the long-haul market. A Nile cruise and trip to Luxor is typical of these target offers, costing between Â£475 and Â£936 depending on the itinerary and time of the year. Kuoni has also increased its capacity to the Caribbean and Kenya and added new destinations such as Argentina, Comores, Goa and Cuba. But Thailand and other Far East destinations such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Bali are still Kuoni's main attractions, with most travellers opting for itineraries which combine two or more countries in the region. Long-haul travellers with British Airways's Speedbird programme may be forgiven by being confused by the name changes the airline's holiday operations have undergone. Speedbird is now being incorporated under the new BA Holidays Worldwide brand and may disappear as a separate brand name next year, although no final decision has been taken. BA's belief is that its holidays business should be clearly defined. This leaves little room for either of ts two main brands. But with the unexpected departure last week of Liam Strong, BA's marketing director, all that could change again next year. Nonetheless, BA's new worldwide brochure has added 50,000 more holidays for next year, 15 per cent more than this year. BA, unlike most other long-haul operators, has guaranteed all its holiday prices against any surcharges. It believes that Egypt will recover fully next year from the after-effects of the Gulf war and to help stimulate demand has introduced charter flights into Luxor, enabling a Â£142 price reduction - to Â£418 - over this year's prices for a week's holiday including a four-night cruise on the Nile. Specialist operator Abercrombie & Kent is marking its 30th anniversary next year with ten new destinations in its worldwide brochure. Uganda is back after 15 years, because of its more stable political environment, with Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Tibet, and Chile new to the brochure. A series of escorted group tours to 13 destinations, including the \"silk road\" from China to Pakistan, has been added. What A & K has found this year is that many regular travellers are looking for more activity holidays away from the well-trodden tourist paths. Next month it is bringing out a specialist walking holiday brochure featuring off-the-beaten track trekking in Kenya, the Atlas Mountains, and Andalucia. While South Africa is already showing signs of becoming one of the top-selling long-haul destinations of the 1990s, in the shorter-term the US is likely to be the area of most growth for experienced travellers willing to organise their own itineraries. This is due to the growing price competition between North Atlantic airlines which is making a trip to America a bargain over the next six months, helped by BA's decision to officially sell unsold seats through bucket shops at discounted prices.

   "text_content" : "N PAPER, the 1991-92 Paris opera season promises extraordinary riches. Four theatres have launched their programmes: the Bastille, ChAtelet, Champs-Elysdes and - most valuable of all, with its unique capacity for putting on both small- and medium- size operas - Opira-Comique are all in action. A wider variety of works is being offered than in any other city in the world; on four evenings of one September week one could successively catch two Mozarts (Ido- meneo and Figaro) at the Bastille, Berg's Lulu at the ChAtelet, and Donizetti's La Favorite at the Opera-Comique. This is just one example of the possibilities that spread out before the Paris public this season, and there will be many others like it. Whether quality is keeping step with quantity in Paris is, on the other hand, a decidedly moot point. Only the Bastille has its own stable orchestra (if that is the mot juste for such a notoriously unruly band); and the redevelopment and promo- tion of French singers - who up to the mid-1960s were still to be found in starring roles in this city - is a duty being left largely to the provinces. Alone among the four theatre manage- ments,' the Opdra-Comique earnestly strives to revive (among other things) neglected treasures from the French oper- atic trove: the season starts, boldly, with the return of a once-famous French-lan- guage Donizetti opera (1840) in its original form. Yet it is worrying that in neither of the two casts assembled for alternative performances is there a single franco- phone principal. There is really no such thing as (in the old sense) a Paris opera company at all: warehouse or emporium would be more accurate term of description. As so often in the musical history of this city, a cha- otic confusion of artistic aims and motives, relieved by (sometimes brilliantly successful) short-term planning strata- gems, seems to me the current order of the day., It was a splendid idea, though, to revive the second opera Donizetti wrote for Paris - and only the strictest purists will make any capital out of the fact that he did so for the large stage of the Opdra, not the smaller one of the Opdra-Comique. La Favorite, which until 1918 was regularly played there, thereafter kept its tenuous hold on world popularity in its Italian translation; but, as every Donizettian knows who has ever compared the two versions even briefly, La favorita is a ghastly botch-up of La Favorite. The original French grand opera explores the struggle between sacred and Max Loppert applauds the revival of an original French 'grand opera' in Paris profane love undergone by the central fig- ure Fernando (tenor) - first novice, later warrior - in the service of the Castillian king Alfonso XI (baritone) and in his unwitting courtship of the king's unhappy mistress Leonora de Guzman (mezzo). It counts among the most elevated of all the composer's achievements - and musi- cally, indeed, among his most consistently inspired scores (and this in spite of the fact that much of its music was redeployed from earlier Donizetti operas either unper- formed or unfinished). The forms are large in scale, the orchestration is rich, and the vocal writing, bar a few rum-ti-tum stret- tas, is severely simplified, achieving in solo and duet a spacious \"Verdian\" canti- lena. From the final two acts of La Favor- ite to the Verdi of Forza and Don Carlos is the smallest of steps. But Italian censorship in the mid-19th- century, which turned a particularly rigor- ous gaze on religion and historical person- ages in opera, reduced much of the Italian translation to narrative nonsense; and it is this nonsense, given as La favorita by singers and opera-houses too lazy to undertake even the most basic corrections of garbled plot detail, that has kept its toehold on the repertory. People who know the work only from the most famous arias - the mezzo's \"0 mio Fernando\", the tenor's \"Spirto gentil\" - would surely be amazed to discover how fine the whole work can be in its original form. This was the point that the Op6ra-Comi- que management set out to prove, and in spite of obvious weaknesses in the per- formance they did so with room to spare. The production by San Bartolom6, first shown at the summer festival at Vichy, had the advantage of handsome set and ravishing costume designs by Patrick Ter- oitin combining the worlds of medieval Arab paintings and the Trds Riche Heures: brilliant colours (turquoise, aquarmarine, crimson, rust, emerald and chestnut), strong lines, a pictorial boldness that, in an opera graced with Iberian musical accents, sounded exactly the right exotic note. This visual high style was not answered by the staging as a whole, which found place for one or two Gallicly fancy ideas (Alfonso's neglected queen mopes silently in the background) and others that were simply ill-executed. The playing of Con- certs Colonne orchestra under Arturo Tamayo was rough; and the French lan- guage, though surprisingly well uttered by the principals - American Leonora, Welsh Alfonso, Filipino Fernando - was gener- ally less than beautifully sung. The pure tone and poised bel canto line required by grand opera were remotest from Noel Velasco's raw Fernando, least far from Jason Howard's Alfonso (he was the favourite of the Paris audience). The Leonora of that fine artist Katherine Cie- sinski came somewhere in the middle: musically sophisticated, vocally clouded and effortful. These and other vagaries notwithstanding, the case for the original Favorite was made: now it's up to the big companies to profit from the experience.

   "text_content" : "N BRINGING Three Worlds to London from America. the Royal Acad- emy does us a true favour. It is a retrospective of the work of the Italian painter, Francesco Clemente, small but comprehensive enough to fill the Academy's new Sackler Galleries (until October 27), its premise the three worlds of the artist's career to date: Italy in the 1970s, then India and, since 1982, New York. Not yet 40, he is one of the stars of the transavanguardia, that constellation of bright young Italian figurative expres- sionists which swam into our keh isbihe ten years'ago. Clem- ente's work has been shown in London, but only in compara- tively small doses in mixed exhibitions. The present favour gives us a chance to take its measure. The truth is that he is both less impressive than his hagi- ographers would have him, and more interesting than any crudely reactive prejudice might expect. His natural graphic talent and visual wit are clear enough, especially in the earlier work but, in terms both of technique and imagery, yet again it is the old story of wishes and horses, of the prop- e osition being taken for its real- 1 isation. There is no advance or development, no worthy strug- B gle, but only elegant, some- f times not so elegant variation. It is all very well for the cat- t alogue to present its hero as 1 the modem universal man - r mystic, philosopher, artist, s poet - but the claim rests e where it is made, on the page, i critical pretension rather than e persuasion. Clemente has a quirky way of e drawing, at times close in feel- , ing to early Freud though with t none of that feverish intensity, - and some of the self-portraits r have a certain charm. The i- vivid and rapid water-colours i are decorative enough, but again he is no Nolde or Ensor. i His paint is thin, his drawing r often weak and slack, his mod- s elling non-existent, his images too often left off incomplete. 1 He has evidently been per- - suaded that the justification of the work, any work, lies not in ' the fabric and the making of 9 the thing, in the way it is 1 painted and drawn, in what it t is, but in the image it carries. 1 It is not that Clemente cannot s do it, and the series of Indian miniature pastiches suggest an f underlying technical curiosity and understanding, but only \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t that he thinks it either unnec- essary or unimportant to sus- tain the work at this practical level. \"In an increasingly despiri- tualized world, Clemente's meditations reanimate exis- tence itself through the renewal of vision and therefore the constant renewal of the mind... (his) visual meander- ings comprise a cosmology, an organic and open-ended sys- tem, complete unto itself and capable of embodying all of the elements of the physical and psychic world.\" Such vaunting nonsense does him no favour at all. Ken Currie (Raab Millbank, 6 Vauxhall Bridge Road SW1 & Riverside Studios, Crisp Road W6: until October 11) is one of another group shot to promi- nence in the 1980s, the new Glasgow School. He is a fine draughtsman, with an ability to compose and organise the figure on the grand scale all but unique in his generation. But he too shares something of the Clemente problem, albeit in reverse, in that so heavy is the specific polemical burden of his imagery that we can barely get through it to the work as such. He alone would carry the horrors of the modern world, with every enormity of abuse and degradation, physical, political and domestic alike, heaped high together in his paintings. And yet without irony and detachment and a certain ambiguity, there is left little room for us to approach his work in our own way, in the light of our own experi- ence. Who would not agree with him? We know the world is savage, unfair, corrupt. But for Currie to bludgeon us into that agreement is almost to suppose that without his prompting, we would have never known as much. William Packer",

   "text_content" : "AKE LOVE not war; flower power: wom- en's lib: the 1960s inspiration behind Torsten Fischer's Lysistrata at the Schauspielhaus, Cologne is so brilliantly and obviously apt that you wonder no one had thought of it before. Aristo- phanes' comedy of a housewife who organises a female boycott on sex until the Athenian wars are stopped takes place amid 1960s sit-ins, marches, demos. With Cologne Schauspiel, now legendary for high-tech staging and stylised crowd choreogra- phy, the work is a slick and perfectly realised parable for our times. Peace, equal rights, the end of the old ideologies, the fighting in Yugoslavia: pick any issue where mass political will changes lives and this production strikes home. At Cologne, interpretation begins with theatricality and with this company's sustained rethinking of the stage as a vertical rather than a horizon- tal space and of the auditorium - stalls, aisles, balcony - as its extension. For Lysistrata, Herbert Shafer erects a huge yellow ramp from the pit to the roof of the stage; from the back of the auditorium, leaping the cental three seats in each row and into a trapdoor in the ramp, runs a metallic blue catwalk. A piano with lumi- nous pink sheet music floats to the top of the ramp, joined by a female jazz band; singers loll over the catwalk. Music equals political rheto- ric. Lysistrata's meeting flops until she sings; then lights dim, stars come up on the blue backcloth, women old and young, in suits, jeans, overalsk pop up from the stalls, from Ches No a80: White retracts K(g6)xR(h5). Black takes back R(h8)zQ(h5). This leaves WK at g6, Q at h5; BK at e at h8. Black now castles, and White mates by Qh7. every door, from the pit. A live sheep emerged from a seat near me and its peasant owner scrambled to reach the march; the comic Spartan women - often heavily accented Scots in British versions - are butch drum majorettes, short-haired and thick-set. All crawl on to the catwalk, bellowing out belief as they join the tunes. Radicals triumph; the old guard - out-dated magistrates and bankers, puffing, top-hat- ted and stumbling on walking sticks - are polished off; women occupy the ramp/ Acropblis/Deutsche Bank. Tempted back to sex - one woman escapes via a red heart- shaped trap in the ramp - the music recalls them. In a mov- ing, passionate plea Lysistrata restates her message in Thomas Hurllmann's sarcastic- sentimental lyrics; a moon rises, one by one the women step back inside. In a theatre steeped in Brechtlan tradition, echoes of Welll's jazzy idealism are unmistakeable. Out of the chorus fights, which send men slithering down the ramp and women dancing after them on ropes, come uniformly fine individ- ual; performances. Traute Hoess's Lysistrata is a power- ful portrayal of an ordinary women moved to political action and gaining confidence, vision and know-how as she goes; Therese Durrenberger as her neighbour Calonice devel- ops from a Chanel-suited Vogue-reading flirt who sees the catwalk as a fashion forum into a breathless and dishev- elled radical. In a recent Cologne Threepenny Opera these actresses were paired as Jenny and Polly; here they sing, dance and act with the same energetic conviction. Among the men, Herbert Knaup as the sex-starved hus- band venturing to retrieve his wife gives one of the most rau- cously funny and sexy comic performances I remember in the theatre. He leads a chorus of large-limbed, padded-shoul- dered American baseball hus- bands, each in colour-toned helmet, sweatshirt and train- ers, all with great rods jutting suggestively out of their track- suits, who eventually succumb to peace rather than endure celibacy. This is an exhilarat- ing version of the play. 90 min- utes of sheer theatrical delight and a magnificent opening to the new season. Jackie Wullschlager",

   "text_content" : "N ORTHERN Ballet Theatre first staged Don Quixote three years ago. The production's title, The Amazing Adventures of Don Quixote, indicated that this was something rather dif- ferent from the old classical farrago with the name of the Don a peg on which to hang a madcap assembly of dances. Christopher Gable, as pro- ducer, sought to make the Knight a central presence, turning to Cervantes for inci- dents that might be added on to Minkus' merry score and the accepted Petipa/Gorsky chore- ography. Tim Goodchild provided handsome design - a notably good first act of monochrome shutters and windmills - and the stage action looked no sil- lier than in more conventional stagings. The choreography, though, left much to be desired. Now Gable, NBT's director, has revived the stag- ing and brought in the French ballet-master Michel Rahn to re-work the dances. The result, as I saw on Thursday night at the Grand Theatre, Wolver- hampton, is markedly success- ful. This is still a different Don Quixote. The love-story of Kitri and Basilio, customarily the thread running through the entire action, is now confined to the first scene. The second act moves from gypsy camp to vision scene without the usual jousting with windmills, and the dryad visions are partnered by the Knight as his younger self, enraptured by these ideals of beauty. The third act, the weakest and most inconse- quential in the production, pro- poses a bizarre intrigue with bearded odalisques, a Duchess, and a final confrontation with a mirrored Knight in whose reflecting shield Don Quirote sees the reality of his addled old age. The grand pas de ux falls to a matador and his lady who are apparently an up- market cabaret turn But no-one ever went to see Don Quixote for logic. A pro- duction stands or falls on the vitality of its dances, and on a stellar presence to give heart to some of Petipa's most bril- liant inventions. NBT may not yet call upon a Plisetskaya or a Maximova to flame in glory as Kitri, but I was most happy to see Vinciane Ghyssens in the role. With her racde physique and witty appreciation of the choreography, she makes a delightful figure of the girl, well supported by a devoted and sparky Basilio from Wil- liam Walker. The surrounding villagers dashed over the stage as to the manner born: throughout the evening I was impressed by the rounded, unsparing perfor- mances that Gable has encour- aged from his artists. They work happily as an ensemble, and the staging gains enor- mously thereby. So it does from the readings of Paul Lewis and Jeremy Kerridge as Quixote and Sancho Panza: given with dignity, and not a little humour, these are excel- lent portraits. For the grand pas of the last act, Lorena Vidal and Palo Savoye, albeit not ideally matched in phy- sique, provided the bravura steps expected of them. Michel Rabn's version of the traditional text, and his inter- polated dances, are well- crafted, and benefit from the company's verve. A particular pleasure of the evening was owed to the musical standards. Brian Flekdhouse has made a sensitive and stylish adapta- tion of Minkus (with an added lazunov adaglo for the vision scene) that sits featly upon NBT's orchestra. The musi- clans, under Francis Rainey, play it with considerable flesser many other ballet per- formances in Britain would benefit from such care and respect for score and execu- Clemm Crisp",

   "text_content" : "T HE APPARENTLY warlike strain that showed this week proved not to be war- like at all. (War was kept for the news bulletins.) The first of Radio 4's Conversations with Historians (Saturday, repeated from last week) gave us Sir Michael Howard talking with John Miller. Sir Michael is the master military historian of our time, but he is not warlike. War is about killing people and ordering the killing of other people, he reminded us, but the study of war does not promote war. History helps create morality. It has seen off slav- ery, the burning of heretics, Nazism; today's concern for other races, for women, for deviants, is the result of histor- ical processes. In the interval of the LPO concert on Radio 3 on Thurs- day, Daniel Pick gave a paper on The War Machine. The ethos of precision in war, he argued, was a catalyst of mad- ness (but the writers he quoted had none of them been directly involved in war). In Butler's Erewhon even the precision of a watch could cause paranoia. Romain Rolland's fantasy of thinking weapons, The Revolt of the Machines, had tanks that changed sides on their own. The robots in Capek's RUR were fitted with a \"pain nerve\" to reduce their passion. Ruskin actually thought the Franco- Prussian war had changed the climate. Pick's conclusion was like Howard's, that the study of war may help prevent it. The one really warlike voice was the American, Paul Sus- sell, in his interview with (Radio 3's Third Ear, Tuesday). Fussell was particularly con- cerned with irony, defined by Philip Roth as \"moral feeling so strong that it can find no outlet but in ridicule\". Fussell is still much concerned with war; one of his books is Thank God for the Atom Bomb, his genuine, but disguised, thanks for not having had to fight the Japanese forces in 1945. Like Howard, he had close experi- ence of war, which Butler, Rol- land, Capek, Ruskin did not Consequently he writes far more sensibly about it. Derek Cooper and the enchanting Food Programme (Radio 4, Friday) have spent a couple of weeks in Ireland. Among the things we've learned are that there is no real Irish national cuisine, not even Irish stew; that the Irish are so given to serving huge portions that they often tend to translate \"no\" as \"yes\"; and that Guinness, or anyway the porter from which it is derived, was originally invented by accident in London. And talking about food prompts me to say that among the light- weight g-eesing Eat Drink and Be (Radio 4FM, Monday) is silly beyond the acceptable average, and clever people like Clement Freud and Julian Critchley shouldn't be so silly as to be involved in it. The Tuesda pay on Radio 3 was Interesting, not for any mcial berit for its near- abe of any. See Lenter's A Fed and is HBart was bast- cally a tale. Geaoey, a UdUddte man with a severe heart coMidton is told to stay at home instead of working, and finds that his wife Wendy has another man, Chris, though so far only for shop- ping together. Suspicious Geoffrey goes shopping with them, picks a fight with Chris and has a heart attack. Rushed home by ambulance, he lies in bed while in the same bed Chris tries to seduce Wendy. Less basic than that is Geoff- rey's heart, with a voice of its own. It reveals its own jeal- ousy, of Geoffrey's adherence to his feelings when they might lead to his heart's col- lapse. Apparently they do, for after he witnesses the impotent sex between Chris and Wendy, we end on a run of heartbeats, leading, no doubt, to a fadeout. As inept as the plot are the drivelling scenes along the way. Why did we hear Timmy playing at robots if he had no function? Did Chris have the frozen peas in his trouser pocket for any reason beyond the schoolboy jokes? The author has twice won Fringe awards at Edinburgh, but she writes as if she were about 16. Alison Hindell, the director, could make nothing of it. B.A. Young",

   "text_content" : "HE vacancies for the top jobs in British opera have now been filled. This past week Nicholas Payne from Opera North has been appointed opera director at Covent Garden, Dennis Marks from BBC television as general director of English National Opera, and Richard Jarman from English National Ballet as managing director of Scot- tish Opera. If to this one adds the appointment a few weeks ago of Matthew Epstein (currently Vice President and Special Consultant of the powerful American agents' firm Colum- bia Artists Management) as general director of Welsh National Opera, the new look of the main companies begins to be established for the 1990s. Among opera insiders there will be greatest rejoicing that Payne has been secured for one .of the London posts. Previous jobs at Covent Garden, the Arts Council and the Welsh National (where he was Sinan- cial Controller) led to ten years at Opera North. Here, a tough sense of eco- nomic realism and an informed passion for the medium com- bined to make his the most consistently impressive artistic leadership of any in the land. At Covent Garden, with all its agonies of re-development and perpetual underfunding, his particular expertise should pro- vide a huge boost to both house management and morale. The ENO appointment of Dennis Marks is a bold stroke. Marks's artistic experience has been gained very largely in television - in recent years he has masterminded such opera activities as the broadcasting of the New York Met's Ring and the studio productions of contemporary operas such as Turnage's Greek and Tippett's New Year. The problems confronting the ENO, not least the all-too- possible loss of the Coliseum when the lease runs out, are if anything more uncomfortable than those hovering over Bow Street: Marks's arrival from television - like that of Jer- emy Isaacs in 1987 - is pre- sumably intended to throw up new ways of solving them. All the opera companies are faced with labours of Hercu- lean proportions, perhaps none more than Scottish Opera. Richard Jarman comes to a company demoralised by the unceremonious departure of Richard Mantle in the wake of disagreements over balance- sheet imbalances. The most operatically \"estab- lished\" of the new men other than Payne is the American Epstein, who comes to the Welsh company with an envi- able reputation for divining and nurturing new singing tal- ent; but his stated intention to continue in his Columbia Art- ists post while running an opera company raises all sorts of prickly ethical questions that no-one at WNO has yet dealt with at all satisfactorily.

   "text_content" : "CLUB AND congress players who use the Sicilian Defence 1 e4 c5 often have a simplistic idea of its strategy. They know that a fianchettoed black bishop at g7 is a lynchpin which should rarely be exchanged for a knight; and since Bobby Fischer they know the dangers of a bishop at a2 or b3 supporting a white pawn attack by f4-s5. Volume 2 of Lev Polugaev- sky's The Sicilian Labyrinth (Pergamon, Â£12.50) shows the true variety of Sicilian middle games. A white knight or bishop at d5, or their black counterparts at e5, can domi- nate the board. Anatoly Karpov, who prefers the white side of the opening, has won many Sicilian endings with bishop against knight or bishops of opposite colours; while exchange sacrifices of rook for bishop or knight are frequent. Polugaevsky highlights how Mikhail Botvinnik, world champion 1948-63, won Sicil- ians as Black with queen and light-squared bishop; this week's game is a Botvinnik classic (N Padevsky, White; M Botvinnik, Black; Sicilian Defence; Moscow 1956). 1 e4 c5 2 Ns3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Ns6 5 Nc3 d6 6 Bc4 e6 7 0-0 Be7 8 Be3 0-0 9 Bb3 Na5 10 f4 b6 11 Qs3? Too slow. The critical plan is 11 e5 Ne8 12 f5.Bb7 12 g4 Rc8 13 g5 Rxc31 For his sacrifice, Black gains the initiative and active bish- ops, either as in the game or by 14 gxf6 Rxe3 15 Qxe3 Bxf6. 14 bxc3 Nxe4 15 Qg4 Qc8! 16 Rs3 Nxb3 17 axb3 f5 18 Qh4 e5 19 Rh3 h6 20 Qh5. White is trying for gxh6, hxg7 and mate. Botvinnik quietly lines up his long diagonal attack. Qxc3 21 Rd1 exd4 22 Bd2 Qc6 23 gxh6 Ng5 24 Rg3 Qhl+ 25 Ks2 Ne4+ 26 Resigns. If 26 Ke2 Nxg3+ wins the queen and soon mates. Chess no. 890 A strange puzzle (by Dr J Sun- ver) with an unusual stipula- tion. White takes back his last move, then Black replaces his own last move by a different choice which allows White to deliver checkmate in one. Solution Page XX Leonard Barden",

West's opening lead of the heart five was taken by the ace, and East returned the four. South played his nine, losing to the queen, and won the third heart with his king. Crossing to the spade king, declarer led a club, finessed the knave, crossed again to the diamond ace, and finessed the club queen. He cashed the ace, but no king dropped, and he ended with only eight tricks. Let us replay the hand. When dummy goes down, we count two tricks in spades, one in hearts, and two in dia- monds. Therefore, we need four club tricks, so we assume that the king is onside. There is another consideration - should East hold four clubs, an extra entry to dummy is needed. We play dummy's heart knave - West may have led from ace and queen - but East plays the ace. We have the answer: throwing our king under the ace. Now nothing is going to stop us from getting back to dummy three times. East leads his last heart to West's queen, and West leads a third heart to dummy's knave. We take one club finesse, and can return to dummy twice for the other two. E.P.C Cotter",

   "text_content" : "THIRTEEN years ago James Callaghan, Labour's last Prime Min- ister, sang \"Waiting at the Church\" to the trades union congress in Brighton, teasing the delegates about whether he would go to the country that autumn or the following spring. Against all expectations and in spite of union leaders' private warn- ings that they could not hold the line for wage controls any longer, Callaghan plumped for the spring. The winter of discontent forecast by union bosses duly materialised and in the spring Margaret Thatcher reaped her harvest, the first of three general election victories. With an election again in the wind, the Conservative propaganda machine has used the weeks run- ning up to Labour's 1991 party con- ference, which opens tomorrow to crank out images of that distant, strike-ridden winter. And trade union bogeymen have been exhumed to frighten the children of Thatcherism. Conservative Central Office has reserved a leading role in its horror movie for Rodney Bickerstaffe, the 46-year-old general secretary of the public service workers' union NUPE, veteran of the winter of dis- content, and current president of the TUC. However, just as film stars always turn out to be a foot shorter than you imagined them, so bogey- men, seen up close, can fail to live up to the picture created by the political scriptwriters. To be sure, Bickerstaffe refuses to disown the ideals on which the labour movement was founded, yet he is a thoroughly modern trade union officer and highly regarded by colleagues. He refuses to follow fashion in clothes, too, yet is always smartly turned out. He is a leftwin- ger, but not so rigidly doctrinal that he feels obliged to shake his fists from the sidelines in condemnation of the party's rapid rightwards drift. On the speaker's rostrum Bicker- staffe employs a combination of ranting and mockery learned from his predecessor Alan Fisher at the NUPE school of rhetoric. (When your message is the injustice of pov- erty, your language cannot be very subtle). In private he is still loqua- cious, but the mockery gives way to a gentler humour. The passion that Bickerstaffe injects into his public speeches about the low-paid may sound stylised, yet it is there in his private conversation too. His anger may be thought immoderate, but it is real. Behind the tough Yorkshire manner there is an affectionate, even sentimental, man. Because his union members are so badly paid Bickerstaffe chooses not to live in the style to which some general secretaries have become accustomed. If he goes abroad on holiday, it is on a coach trip. He gets paid Â£36,000 a year, but (well-founded rumour has it) gives a lot of that away. He devotes part of his scarce free time to campaigning for Britain's least popular minority, the gypsies. By coincidence, Bickerstaffe's deputy, Tom Sawyer, is this year's chairman of the Labour Party. So I asked the obvious question. Would a Labour Government do the unions' bidding? Bickerstaff denied there would be an explosive release of pent-up expectations if Labour were elected, leading to hyperinflation and huge public expenditure, even though over the last 12 years the rich had got richer and the poor poorer. \"What we do expect is a stop to the pain. Things must not get worse. That's what we're asking of the Labour Party in government. -And that's their only promise: we'll try not to make things worse.\" The relationship between unions and party was not set in constitu- tional concrete, he said. It had changed from decade to decade, even year to year. Today it was an open question how much, and how quickly, TUC aspirations would be met by a Labour government. As president of the European Christian Tyler asks union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe what a Labour government would mean public service workers unions, Bickerstaffe is often in Brussels. Did he hope to secure from the EC benefits for organised labour that the British Labour Party was afraid to give? \"That suggests the Labour party is afraid of doing something because of this alleged public per- ception of it kow-towing to the trade unions. I don't think they are.\" Bickerstaffe was a national officer of NUPE during that politically disastrous winter of 1978-9. I asked him if the memory bothered him. \"No. We can't run away and I don't run away from that period. What we were trying to do then on behalf of our membership was to stop the pain in terms of poverty pay. The Tory Party talks perpetu- ally about the unburied dead. The fact that they don't care about the living and dying doesn't seem to matter. \"On November 10, John Major will be down there at the Cenotaph, quite properly, honouring the dead as we all do. But as I've said often enough, it's no good honouring the dead one day of the year and dish- onouring the living for the rest of the 365 days.\" The experience of 1979 showed that the unions and the Labour Party weren't in one another's pock- ets, he said. \"And if we were over- powerful, how come our people got such disgustingly low pay, so low that some who work for the Depart- ment of Health or Social Security at the end of the week have to go to that same department to get benefits?\" What kind of leftwinger are you? I asked him. \"We could get into a headscratch- ing debate about that but as far as our people are concerned, I try to project what they think. People challenge me: are you ultra-left, are you hard left? I say I'm sensible left. What I want is achievable; it can be done. \"Some people say that like the rest of the movement I have been dragged to the right, compared with markers posts like Arthur Scargill, Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner. But I have done that very, very slowly. I'm a small 'c' conservative. I don't leap to change things for the sake of it.\" The Labour Party had been drop- ping some of the old baggage, he said, and was derided by opponents for its champagne socialism. \"What I'm concerned about is that some of the old stuff must stay. And that old stuff for me is the compassion, the drive, the anger that here we have one of the 20 richest nations on earth and mil- lions of our people are getting exploited. There has got to be heart, soul, vision, whatever the early pio- neers of the movement had. I'm anxious that we re-write it in every generation.\" \"People should not lose the anger of their youth. What's the old say- ing? If you're not a socialist at 21 you haven't got a heart; if you're not a conservative at 31 you haven't got a head. The idea is that you progress and you forget it all. . . That shouldn't be true either personally or collectively.\" I asked Bickerstaffe whether this anger had anything to do with the poverty of his own background. Born in Doncaster, he never knew his father and was brought up by his mother (whose name he took) in her parents' house. She was a union activist and has been a member of NUPE for 51 years. His stepfather was a school caretaker. His moth- er's father was a shop steward and chaired meetings of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement; his mother died in the workhouse. At nine years old, young Rodney was photographed with a NUPE banner and early on he decided he would become either a politician or a trade union official. He did well at school, getting eight 0 levels and three A levels (history, English and geography) which took him to Ruth- erford College, now Newcastle Poly- technic, to get a second in sociol- ogy. He joined the Labour Party. (Unlike many union leftwingers, Bickerstaffe was never in the Com- munist Party). The answer to my question was No. \"I had a great childhood. I can't say we weren't ever so poor. We were.\" He added that family life was not a matter of being left wing or right wing. \"But it was certainly an influence. We had a tremendous working class library and I still have about 114 of the Left Book Club books; they belonged to my grandfather. Of course the house is pulled down now, as a slum.\" Where does this anger come from then? \"It's not being from poor myself. It's knowing poor people.\" His Lydia van der Meer greatest dislike, he said, is hypoc- risy: \"people being able to see disad- vantage and, having the power to do something, then not doing it.\" Conversely, his admiration is great- est for those who try and ameliorate things even if they have little power or influence. When Bickerstaffe encounters the well paid - a government minister, or a journalist, for that matter - he sees also the man or woman who has to clean up after him: the road- sweeper, the lavatory cleaner, the the hospital nurse, the gravedigger. It is an uncomfortable scrutiny for the comfortably off. People might say you were a bit puritanical, I suggested. \"Clive Jenkins once said I was a hair-shirt socialist. Not true. That gives the impression of some long- haired hermit in the desert.\" But you like to poke fun at people who indulge themselves? \"No, I don't think I do. On the earning front, what people do with their money is up to them. What I don't like is people who make it and then tread down on those who haven't made it. I don't mind people who go off and eat their quail eggs.\" Have you ever eaten quail eggs? Bickerstaffe laughed uproariously in anticipation of his answer. \"What do they look like?\"",

   "text_content" : "NOWFALL ON canvas. I had heard this sound long ago, and now again as I awoke slowly to the daunting real- ity that I was one of three sand- wiched in a two-man tent, perched precariously on the summit of the Eiger. Eight of us were camped on a ridge about four feet wide with sheer drop on one side and a snow cornice rising like a wave behind us. We were wrapped in impenetra- ble cloud. \"Could be here a while,\" said a companion. How long that while might last, we did not know. The helicopter which was due to lift us off could only fly if it was clear. Thoughts turned to the fear- some mythology of th ountain renowned as the most in the Alps. It is called the \"killer mountain\" with reason. The Eiger's history of deaths made the events of the previous day all the more remarkable. Last Sat- urday no fewer than 43 climbers - able and disabled, young and old, black, white and yellow - con- verged on the minuscule summit from the four points of the compass, all in the name of charity. Huddled in an unstable human mass, the cautious clipped safety harnesses securely to a rope; others, less cau- tious, or less aware, did not. A sin- gle slip would have resulted in cer- tain death. But all, except an enthusiastic few who preferred to climb down, were lifted to safety next day. A veteran Alpinist said: \"The Eiger's never seen anything like it.\" Rebecca Stephens climbed 'killer mountain' with 42 others of all races and ages The ascent was the culmination of three years work by one of Britain's more visionary climbers, 47-year-old Edwin Drummond, a writer and poet. In Drummond's words, it was a \"social climb of con- science\" intended to benefit the environment, human rights and the Third World. This four-sided ascent of the Eiger was the most ambitious of wide range of projects organised by Drummond's group, \"Climb for the World.\" Over the same weekend some 50,000 participants walked, climbed and scrambled up more modest peaks in the British Isles to raise money donated, via the UK United Nations Association, to projects in the developing world. But in Switzerland that weekend our minds were concentrated on safety first. The Eiger is loose at the best of times, but the weather recently had been warm and the mountain a pile of rubble. Already, Silvia FitzPatrik, a 27-year-old Argentinian, had been struck in the face by a rock fall on the notorious North Face. Her bloody nose was firmly pic- tured in my mind as I set off to climb the more benign western flank, a route labelled, rather irrita- tingly, by accomplished climbers, \"the way down.\" Still, we had to take care. There were ten of us on this route - including a teenage Nepalese and a blind man - at times, one vertically in line above another. A single misplaced foot caused the breath to beheld as rocks tumbled on those below. Day one took us across an icefleld and over a mass of crumbling grey rock to half-way camp pitched on a tiny ledge of levelled scree. In mountaineering the limited tent space invariably means one is sar- dined nose to toe with a bunch of complete strangers. I ended up with a doctor, and John Dove, the blind man. \"How on earth do you manage? I asked. \"I train in the gym,\" he said. \"No, how do you see? How do you know where you're going?\" It seemed it was a matter of remembering where his hands had been to know where to place his feet \"I know a slip could be seri- ous,\" he said, \"but I just put it to the back of my mind.\" John was tidier, more able to manage in the confined space of a tent than any- one I knew. He snored sweetly that night, while I didn't sleep a wink, disturbed by the ncessant wind. It took just four hours the second day; a rewarding four hours almng the crest of the North Face to the summit. The view was beyond com- parison, over the knife-edge summit to empty glacial valleys of the pur- est white. We scraped ice from the summit crest and put on a brew in the tent pitched on the ledge was our home for the night. Tea all round and chocolate - first for our western flank team, then Doug Scott - one of the first two British mountaineers to climb Everest, who today acted as guide for a small Tibetan boy on the Eliger's Mittel- legi Ridge. Then for the Russians and the Czechs who took the long approach from the south. Within an hour the summit was packed; and then almost empty, as the last heli- copter ferried all but nine of the the climbers home. Those of as who stayed, took a risk camping on the summit that night The weather report was only fair, but the temptation of a long evening on a clear and beautiful Alpine peak was irresistible. Morn- ing came and our worst fears were realised. The weather had turned. We were lucky, though. That afternoon, the dcloud blew away just long enough for a helicopter to fly in and take us home. But the weather progressively worsened. Two eager young Dutchman had set oar for dte North Face that morning, and would spend the night on the bitter, expoed face Pea hr a rpa alotp o EWlg n a old elb of colodaSe",

   "text_content" : "Dominic Lawson weighs the exhilaration of boxing against the damage of the blows I DON'T think I've ever gained so much pleasure and excitement from a sporting event as when I witnessed a world championship boxing match in Las Vegas last year. I had gone to Vegas to to write an article about Don King, the fight business's most suc- cessful promoter. King is quite use- ful with his hands himself, and once killed a man without the aid of any other weapon, but I chose not to ask him about this. Perhaps in return for this uncharacteristic tact on my part, King gave me a ticket for the big fight. I took it, without much intention of going to my first box- ing match, but as the only alterna- tive entertainment was the possibil- ity of losing money on the tables, I turned up, feeling rather ashamed. The first thing one appreciates as a spectator at a boxing match, rather than merely as a television watcher, is the sheer percussive weight of the blows. That is thrill- ing, in a spine-chilling way. The fight went the distance, the chal- lenger being knocked out an instant before the final bell. Several sec- onds after that I found that, like everyone around me, I was standing and cheering. It was the cheering of which the individual is uncon- sdous, a release of the animal or the child in us, and therefore a plea sure of a particularly pure kind. I cannot remember the name of the challenger, and, at the time, proba- bly neither could he. But I do won- der how I would have felt if that final percussive blow had been not merely decisive but fatal. What shame would I have felt, if any? Interesting then to read again the reports of the match between Chris Eubank and the stricken Michael Watson from last Sunday's papers. Most of the correspondents filed, and their papers printed, before it was clear that Watson was suffering more than concussion. Hugh McI- vanney in the Observer praised \"the standards of technique, excitement and intensity\" of the bout, pro- nouncing it \"great\". And he was quite right. The Snaday Tmes man, Harry Mullan, wrote of a \"magnifl- cent fight, one which overflowed with the kind of passion and com- mitment so conspicuously absent from their last encounter\". Again, all true. It is precisely this sort of fight which thrills us, which 0 ----- ---- -- 0- - most endanger the boxers. I recall one boxing writer who had the hon- esty to recall that his first reaction when seeing the blow which killed the Welsh fighter Johnny Owen, was to cry out \"what a punch! what a f.. . .tng punch!\" But, objectively, one should not feel more guilty for having wit- nessed a fight in which someone is knocked out. In the main the dam- age to boxers' brains is not the result of one blow, but of years of constant punishment. Witness the pathetic shell of Muhammad All, who was never knocked out, but is as clear a case as you will see of punch-drunkenness. The greatest fighters of all. All, Sugar Ray Robin- son and Joe Louis, ended up sham- bling, mumbling wrecks. I am therefore tolerant of those who say that boxing should be ban- ned, although I also think they are intolerant and illiberal. But I am intolerant of those who, as Watson's life has teetered against the ropes of oblivion, have vented their spleen on the presentation of boxing rather than the thing itself One such is Sir Bernard Ingham, now an all-pur- pose hack on the Daily Express, who fulminated that \"we should end the disgraceful pre-fight hype which disfigures the sport. Those pathetic nose-to-nose rst-to-blink preliminaries must be stopped\". What possible harm is caused by these fun and games? \"I'll moider da bum\" is almost as old as boxing. Why should this be deemed worse than the real damage the fighters do to each other? I sense here an awful puritanism, which deplores not boxing, but the fact that it is glitzy commercial business; just as the original Puritans abhorred bear- baiting, not because of the distress caused to the bears, but because the spectators took pleasure in it.

   "text_content" : "Nigel Spivey ONE HEARS very little of Arthur Scargill nowadays. The time was when we all knew him intimately: just how many quail's eggs he had for breakfast, the size of his mortgage, etc. From that era (c. 1982) I have preserved one item of Scargilliana which transcended the bibble-babble of tabloid canards. This was the admission, or boast, to the Sunday Times, that Mr Scargill Senior did not let a day go by in which he failed to read a dictionary. Whether King Arthur was enlightened about the coal mines I never knew. But I feel a deep sense of fellowship with his father; a sense of fellowship heightened by recent experience. A former college acquaintance, getting restless as a schoolteacher, wrote to me about a new scheme he had for setting up a consultancy business. He proposed to offer an advisory service on effective communications. In times of recession, he argued, only companies survived which had the edge in communication. He had devised a method of judging efficiency by a combination of computer programmes and psychoanalysis, and wanted to know if I would act as a guinea pig. Though sceptical of Brian's latest wheeze, I obediently bundled up a selection of past journalistic writings and sent them off to be tried by this new analysis. The results came back yesterday, and those results are why I have been thinking fondly of Arthur Scargill's father. Basically (Brian tells me) - basically, his analysis has flagged up some substantive problems in the communication area. It was at this stage only a ballpark assessment, at grass-roots level to boot, but we were basically talking a very anal word-use problem. A significant number of words and phrases that I used were either beyond the spell-check range, or else had long since passed their shelf-life. Among my sold words, Brian listed proselytise, sobriquet, hagiography, eponymous and solipsistic: words, he said, which had no built-in reader friendliness, and failed even to convey any sexy ideas. Then he focused upon a couple of metaphors which showed that I had an Attitude problem. \"You describe someone running about like an organ-grinder's monkey. Be honest: when did you last see an organ-grinder, let alone his monkey? There was more of this:but you get the gist. On one or two points, I had to concede some justification to Brian, especially regarding the monkey (although if you ever have seen an organ-grinder's monkey, you will know how perfectly that image fits a sycophantic person); however, I was bound to refute his conclusion that my communication skills rated somewhere near zero. Flippantly, I scribbled the following note: \"Dear Brian. I will take a rain-check on that consultancy course, or possibly even put it on the back-burner. It will be a no-win situation and worst-case scenario for yours truly, with all those goalposts shifting so rapidly on the HAWKS I &HANDS Li ii bottom line. It is a street down which I do not wish to be up and running. As ever, Nigel.\" That should shut him up. But what is one to do, in a world where the dictionary is despised and rejected of men? Enterprises such as Brian's are spawn of the desktop publishing age. We are continually reminded of the need for smart presentation, neat copy and tidy files. The activity of word-processing is copiously practised wherever you go. But there are no signs whatsoever that people, generally, are becoming more deft in their handling of words; indeed, what strikes one most of all is the increasing poverty of expression within this copiousness. There is a mass of word-processing,but virtually none of what the Russians call \"word-weaving\" (slovospleteniye). Try to think of any modern comedy that depends for its merriment upon verbal wit, like Love's Labour's Lost: the answer is that there is none, because you can no longer depend upon an audience with the knowledge of etymology and associations that would make such comedy possible. This sounds more apocalyptic than it is intended: Love's Labour's Lost has never been one of Shakespeare's most-loved productions. Nor do I advocate the installation of Latin in the National Curriculum, although there is no doubt that what is commonly considered to be model English prose can only be written by someone familiar with Latin. No: all I would plead for is a revival of philology, or logophilia: a little love and care for words, and concern for meaning. You do not need Latin to know the force of calling someone a \"berk\": but I think you ought to know that you are using an abbreviated form of rhyming slang as used in the trenches of the Great War, and therefore the props' force of calling someone a Berkeley Hunt. What rankles with a logophile is not the existence of cliches: after all, they come and go (I think in the pipeline has flowed away), and they are useful when one is feeling tired or lazy. It is rather the way in which cliches are used in documents, broadcasts, boardroom speeches - situations where their users ought to know better. There is no excuse for management consultants or Members of Parliament using the breathless Neanderthal slogans of the post-match changing-room. And Brian's new enterprise deserves to collapse immediately. But, of course, that is not how it goes. In a democracy, the mass-communicators get ahead. Brian will make millions, while the best I can do is write little letters of protest every time I see compliment instead of complement. Caring for words has few but its own rewards, as Dr Johnson knew. If old Mr Scargill is still alive and paying his daily devotions to the dictionary, I salute him. Stout recusants in the ballpark of mindless usage, we dictionary-readers must stick together.",
