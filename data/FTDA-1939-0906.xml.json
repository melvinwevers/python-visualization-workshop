TUESDAY Evening. Money markets reopened to the new order of things to-day and, under the circumstances, functioned exceedingly well. In the foreign exchange section, perhaps, there was a certain amount of disorganisation, but this was due primarily to the difficulty in reading into the many new regulations and their application. Operations were, of course, conducted through the authorised dealers, and they reported a large number of inquiries. The main interest centred in the first \"con- trolled\" rates for sterling, and consider- able surprise was expressed when this was announced as $4.02 to $4.06. The usual fixing of the gold price by London bullion brokers was replaced by the announcement of the fixed buying price by the Bank of England. The silver market, however, was left quite free, but for convenience the hour of fixing has been altered to 30 minutes later than previously. Lombard Street itself reopened almost as if there were no war in progress, with conditions virtually normal. Different clearing banks and other institutions found themselves in differing circum- stances, some having to call in funds while others were free lenders. Short loans, however, were in comfortable supply, fresh accommodation against bills being obtained at 3 per cent. and against bonds at 3X per cent. Business in bills was of modest dimen sions, but it is understood that the assist- ance of the special buyer was hardly required. LOAUluS DCOu.T PER CENT. PhR C\"'Tr.

Sovereigns were quoted at 39s 3d. It was impossible even to estimate turn- over, but the banks reported that they were not overburdened with orders. Silver prices were fixed at 20%d per ounce for cash and 207sd per ounce for forward delivery, an advance of %d in each case. No bullion operations were announced by the Bank of England to-day.

   "text_content" : "TUESDAY Evening. Security dealings, carried out to- day in Throgmorton-street and by telephone between offices, demon- strated the readiness of Stock Ex- change members to provide a public market in stocks and shares. The volume of business was small and dealings were almost entirely a matter of negotiation, but activity was quite as great as could be ex- pected in view of current restrictions. A large part of the work of Stock Ex- change members and their staffs was devoted to dealing with inquiries which could not be executed. Apart from British Government stocks and securities affected by special factors, prices showed little movement from Thursday's House quotations. GILT-EDGED ACTIVE Although business in Government stocks was small, even by recent modest standards, this section was probably the most active. In view of the state of war which has developed since Thursday, prices were marked down to their fixed minimum levels. An impediment to business was the uncertainty created by the substitution of registered for inscribed stock. Declines in the more active securities ranged up to 1', Consolidated 4 per cents, and Conversion 3j per cents. losing that amount at 99 and 88 respec- tively. Local Loans at 74 ex dividend lost the same amount, while losses of 1A were recorded in Old Consols and War Loan. In practically all cases prices were reduced to around their minima. India stocks showed similar declines, the 21 per cents, losing 14 at 566 ex dividend. There was very little busi- V T Tfc % ArV Ii,Â»:r dLIU tU bl 4UULI^ 5JL1L^ ^IJ , ness, an no quo a e pr ce change, in the Dominion and Corporation lists. Dealers in the foreign market re- ported little actual business, activity in this section being restricted by the Treasury Regulations as well as the limitations placed on all dealings. The most striking price changes were made in German and Austrian issues. German 5 per cents. were marked down 154 to 121 and the 4A per cents. 11 points to 10, with practically no busi- ness. Austrian Fives lost 8 at 15 and the 4' per cent. bonds 15 at 30,- the higher price of this issue being due to the in- ternational guarantees it enjoys. Movements elsewhere were generally downward but Argentines provided a notable exception. The 4 per cents, of 1933 fell a point to 80, but the 3J per cent. bonds were as much to the good at 63 and the Conversion Loan hardened to 751. HOME RAIL CHANGES Unofficial minimum prices were fixed by Home Railway jobbers for the prior charge securities. These were generally well below the quotations ruling when the House was last in session. L.M.S. First Preference were down 2 at 494 and L.N.E. Second Guaranteed fell the same amount to 554. Movements in the Ordinary stocks were generally adverse and wider prices were quoted. Southern Pre- ferred fell 4 to 56 and the Deferred I to 114. Foreign Railways attracted little business, but prices for a few Argen- tines were marked down."

   "text_content" : "There will be general relief and approval at the decision to reopen the Stock Exchange to-morrow. It will be regarded as another telling gesture to the world at large. The attempt to form a Street mar- ket yesterday morning was soon frowned upon by the authorities. Although the gathering of members- and others-in Throgmorton-street would have almost filled the Stock Ex- change, the more important firms were not represented and there was much more talk than business. Many Small Deals Leading jobbers who remained in their offices did a fair number of small deals. One gilt-edged jobber alone transacted over 200 bargains. None of the brokers I met was really active. Several discouraged new purchases until they could see their way more clearly. The new regulations are not yet thoroughly known or understood. In some cases they were considered ambiguous. With members all meeting on the Floor of the House to-morrow and able to cross-examine Committee- men business should gradually be made to work as smoothly as is pos- sible under abnormal conditions. Immediate Task At the moment the urgent task is to deliver and obtain payment for the out- standing bargains. The money position of each firm will then become clear and jobbers will know what stock they will be in a position to deliver promptly to purchasers for cash. As one leading jobber put it, we shall know much better where we are after the adjourned Settlement has been held on 21st September. ,Will it be permis- sible then to renew existing contan- goes? Will \"mean prices \" be fixed for equities on the basis of which bulls must close their positions by taking up the stock or selling it? Minima for Equities ? A broker friend contends strongly for minimum prices in respect of all securities besides gilt-edged stocks, for which they have been already fixed. He writes: \"As no dealings could take place below these minima, bulls on Contango account would be pro- tected from having their securities closed at knock-out prices and the public with loans at the bank secured on stocks and shares would similarly be protected.\" Actually, in view of the firmness of prices yesterday- wherever they were tested-the above proposal would look premature, but, of course, it is desirable to be ready for the unexpected. Eight-guinea Gold Nobody I met yesterday was able to explain why the authorities had allowed sterling on New York to drop as low as $4.04 against last week's worst of $4.10. Neither was it known whether this initial war-time rate is to be pegged for an indefinite period or to be subject to daily, weekly or, maybe, monthly variation. The jump of 8s in the official price of gold to the new record of eight guineas per fine ounce took everybody by surprise, but in the circumstances Mining jobbers refused to get excited about it. Kaffirs and General Smuts As regards Kaffirs I heard the hope expressed that the new South African Government to be formed by General Smuts will quietly abandon, or any- way drastically modify, the proposal that the Union Treasury should appro- priate whatever may be received above 150s per ounce for the Rand pro- ducers' gold. Mr. Havenga, who is understood to be resigning with General Hertzog and other of his like- minded colleagues, has been Minister of Finance for many years. As such he has been primarily responsible for a much heavier burden of taxation having been laid upon the Rand than on any other goldfield in the world. General Smuts is a statesman of vastly wider vision. He will recognise clearly that the true interests of South Africa lie in doing everything possible to encourage the expansion of the Rand. b4t i tartst Equrrlca A broker friend contends strongly for minimum prices in respect of all securities besides Rilt-edged stocks, for which they have been already fixed.

Bank of London and South generally wnegotiated on the basis of the 80 closing prices rrling last Thursday. Some inquiry was made for TODACCO shares, and the small demand was assumed to be on investment account. British- American Tobaccos were seldom mentioned in the earl were ealings, but left o easier at I n the ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT section 6 , General Electrics were dealt in on the basis of 72s 6d-75's. Associated Electricals were called 38s 6d. British Electric Traction Deferred was quoted 790-810. Elecktrolux \" B\" improved Y to 7. As regards ELECTRIC SUPPLY issues, the dealers made a 2s price in most of them and quotations were Is to 2s lower. The business coming forward was mainly of an investment character. Many of last week's limits were still found to have been left on. Public interest in MOTOR and AIRCRAFT descriptions was limited, and beyond a fall of 2s 3d to 16s in Dennis Brothers changes were insignificant. FURNESS WITHY STRONG SHIPPING shares provided one of the bright features. Clan Lines were wanted at 120s, against 110s, and P. and 0. De- ferred were marked up 3s to 22s. Bryny- mors were dealt in at 3s, against 2s. Coast Lines closed Is 6d higher at 10s, while Lamport Lines were 2s up at 7s and Cairns Is 3d better at 4s 6d. Furness Withys were up 3s 9d at 22s. The turnover in IRON and STEEL share's was small, and the trend was irregular with - recessions predominating. - United Steels were Is 9d lower at 21s 3d and falls of Is 6d each were shown by Stantons and Birmingham Small Arms. Stewarts and Lloyds were. 2s 3d down at 41s. John Browns fell Is 3d to 27s. On the other hand, Vickers firmed up to 17s 6d and- Consetts to 7s 6d. Swan Hunters and Harland and Wolff were steady. Indian Irons improved to 36s 9d. Among MISCELLANEOUS issues, United Molasses were steady at 23s 6d. The quo- tation for Imperial Chemicals was widened to 27s 6d-30s. RAYON SHARES QUIET Among TEXTILES some inquiry was made for cheap shares, but the supply was not plentiful. Lancashire Cottons rose 9d to 12s, but Coats and English Sewing Cottons were a few pence easier. Some 4%.. Imperiarls wexe unaltered at 6'/i, TUESDAY Evening. Equity shares of all kinds were inquired for to-day, but prices were nominal and dealing was a matter for negotiation. Numerous inquiries were received for Industrials and a fair business resulted, mainly comprising small transactions. Actual business in the Oil market was quite small, but it was possible to obtain a nominal quotation for prac- tically every share. Gold shares attracted a little atten- tion on the rise in the gold price, particularly those of mines without the scope of the new South African tax. LACK OF SELLERS General Inquiry for Shares by Small Investors In the Industrial section a noteworthy feature was the absence of sellers. This was ascribed to possible doubts in the mind of the public regarding the probable course of prices, and it was thought that would-be sellers had held aloof from mar- kets until it was seen how things would move under the new conditions As it was the tone was cheerful, for a good deal of tentative inquiry for shares was reported and it was evident from the limits received by some brokers that bargain-hunters were on the look-out for cheap stock. In this they were dis- appointed, for the lack of sellers left jobbers with low reserves of stock. The business passing, however, was not large in terms of value. A fair turnover was done in the popular Industrials, but the bulk of the demand came from small investors whose orders ran generally from 50 to 100 shares, and the execution of this business, chiefly between office and office after the Street market, was forsaken for the security of the near-by large buildings. At the outset, there was quite a large gathering of brokers and jobbers in the Street and the first hour saw most of the business completed. Prices were nominal and as compared with those ruling before the outbreak of war showed considerable irregularity, but in many directions an improving tendency was shown. In most cases dealing became a matter for negotiation and much time was occupied in getting on to various offices by telephone to conclude bargains. Demand was not restricted to any parti- cular type of share, although a fair amount of inquiry was reported for Ship- pig sses Smeofth Tbacoshre after 6%. Some inquiry was received foi BREWERY shdres, but no important busi ness resulted and prices were nominal Distillers were lowered 4s to 90s. Dealings were restricted by uncertainty as to the South African Government's pro- posal to appropriate the proceeds of the mines' gold sales above 150s per ounce In this connection dealers expressed satis faction with General Hertzog's defeat in the South African Parliament, whicl raised hopes that any new Government formed might take less drastic measures Leading arbitrageurs did not attempt to establish contact with either Johannes burg or Paris. Of individual issues, West Wits. were mentioned at around 4, Venterspost at 1,7 and Western Holdings at 11s 6d. Marie vale at 16s and Palmietkuil at 5s 9d were nominally easier than on Thursday. The jump in the gold price to the nev nigh record of Â£8 8s per ounce-8s above the last quoted price on Friday-brough in buyers for MISCELLANEOUS Gold shares In these issues it was generally the case of dealers wanting the offer of shares at certain prices, but very few sellers could be found. In WEST AFRICANS, Ashanti were wanted at 3%, Ariston at 11s, Bibiani at 25s 6d, Amalgamated Banket at 7s 6d Bremang at 4s and Marlu at 9s 3d Kwahu were about 1%, Taquah ar Abosso 1%l and Gold Coast Selection 19s 6d. Elsewhere, Lake View and Star were finally called 19s 3d-a rise of 9d-aftel 20s at first, and Wiluna nearly Is 6d uI at 9s 4Yd. Dealers in RHODESIAN COPPERS were little inclined to do business pending to-morrow's (Wednesday's) fixing of a maximum price for the metal. Rhokana were called % higher at 11%. Rhodesiar Anglo-American were mentioned at 21s 6d Rhodesian Selection at 14s and Roan at 15s 6d. JUMP IN BURMAS Indian buying orders caused Burma Corporation in the Lead-Zinc-Silver group to be mentioned as high as 11s 3d at one time. The last price heard was 9s 6d, which was still nearly. Is 6d above Thursday's close. Burmas were cabled as having been bid for in Rangoon at 1ls 6d. For a similar reason, Indian Copper were called Is 10%d higher at 4s 3d. One or two of the Australian Broken Hill issues were marked up. Zinc Cor- poration Ordinary and Preference gained 3 apiece to 3% and 5% respectively. Norths hardened to 1% and Souths %' to 1. The few Eastern Tin shares quoted were also better. Malayan were called % higher at 1',, Petaling Is up at 16s and Southern Malayan also Is to the good at 17s. NOMINAL OIL PRICES Royal Dutch Adjusted to Amsterdam Parity In the OIL market it was possible to obtain a price for practically all the shares in the list. Generally, a single price was quoted around which dealers were prepared to negotiate, but it was emphasised that the prices were \"all very nominal.\" In actual practice only a few of the shares were dealt in. As might have been expected, most activity was seen in Royal Dutch and Shells. The opening price of Royal Dutch required adjustment to the higher level established on the Amsterdam Bourse, which was open yesterday. Parity was calculated at \"a little over 40\" and a small business was done at about 40 in early dealings. Buyers did not appear willing to pay this price and the shares eased to 39Y. At this level they showed a rise of 4 points from last Thursday's quotation. Shells were another share in which a few dealings were transacted. After busi- ness over 4% they eased to shaw a decline of %, at 4%,. Other movements in the list showed a certain irregularity which was not really indicative of the state of the market in individual issues. RUBBERS AND TEAS Small Buyers of Some of the Leading Issues Prices were quoted for a number of RUBBER shares, but they were purely nomi- nal. There were buyers of some of the lead- ing issues, but the market lacked sellers, and little business resulted. United Sua Betong were wanted, and rose Is to 46s 3d. Anglo-Dutch started at 22s 6d and closed at 23s 9d, a rise of 4/d on Thursday's quotation. Rubber Trust were 26s 3d (against 26s) and North Malay Is 7yd (is 6d). Else- where London Asiatic were called 3s (3s 3Y4d) and Allied Sumatra 14s 6d (15s). In Mincing Lane there were numerous inquiries for Rubber shares, but no stock was available. The Stock Exchange in Plantation House will reopen to-day (Wed- nesday) from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. There seemed little inclination to do business in TEA shares and quotations were nominal around the levels ruling on Thursday.

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange brokers and jobbers made a valorous attempt to get a mar- ket going in various stocks and shares during a few hours yesterday. It is to be hoped that Government officials gave Throgmorton Street a wide berth, otherwise they would have been shocked to find their wishes in regard to the non-assembling of people in one place had not been carried out with any degree of exactitude. The greater part of the Street be- came thronged with Stock Exchange men, and prices were quoted in a good many things, with a little resultant business. Meanwhile, office staffs went on with the delivery of stock, col- lection of cheques, and so forth, all of which had to be completed by 12.45 p.m. in order to get the money into the banks by 2 o'clock. The Would-be Purchaser By their order that all dealings shall be for cash, the Stock Exchange Committee have laid a ban, of course, upon sales of stocks or shares of which dealers have no supply on their books. In the ordinary course of markets the jobbers would probably sell shares whether they had them or not, the assumption being that the shares would come in according to the regu- lar laws of supply and demand. To deal like this necessitates a certain latitude as regards time for the dealers to purchase and deliver the shares. In dealing for cash, a bar- gain must be settled in a few days. Ready to Deal In the Consol market, prices were quoted more widely than usual, but it was by no means difficult to deal in War Loan, Conversion Three and a- Half per Cents., the two Consols and issues of similar character. Dealers in Home Railway prior charge stocks arranged among themselves an un- official list of minimum prices in their securities. In the Industrial list, a number of the popular shares, Courtaulds, Dun- lops, Shell, Mexican Eagle, Molasses, Imperial Tobacco, etc., were-one can- not say active-negotiable without much trouble. Chryslers were quoted about 92, Nickels 561, Steel 61Ã½. Readers of THE FINANCIAL TIMES may rest assured that if they want either to buy or to sell stock, their Stock Exchange brokers are at hand ready to do all that they possibly can to carry out the wishes of their clients. The client will, nevertheless, quite understand that, under current condi- tions, it is not easy to obtain satisfac- tory prices. Kaffir Considerations Setting out nine cogent considera- tions which should interest holders of South African Gold-mining shares, an enterprising firm of Stock Exchange brokers deal with the action of the Union of South Africa Government in deciding to limit to a price of Â£7 10s per ounce the profits of gold- mining companies. The brokers point out that the proposal is evidently de- signed not only to check unhealthy speculation but to put a reasonable limit on profits made out of an inter- national emergency. A price of 150s per ounce gives a very adequate margin of profit to the mines. The industry was regarded as being well remunerated when the price was 10s per ounce lower. An important consideration is the addi- tional interest which this measure would give the South African Govern- ment in the prosperity of the mines. Union Government as Partner In a way, the Government becomes a predominant partner in the business of the industry: accordingly, labour problems are likely to be reduced. Limitation would also remove the in- centive for the formation of wildcat enterprises based on the present con- ditions, and it is pointed out that there is no reason to regard the figure of Â£7 10s as being rigid. What the speculators will do who bought Gold shares with the object of hedging against currency deprecia- tion remains to be seen. The firm of brokers conclude that the proposal of the South African Government- which, by the way, is not to be brought before Parliament until next year's session-fortifies the credit of the . Union Government.

   "text_content" : "The resumption of Stock Exchange business yesterday under the restric- tive and protective regulations tempo- rarily imposed by the Committee passed off well. Events have moved fast and far since the House closed last Thursday, and he would have been a bold man who attempted to predict how far they had converted investors into either buyers or sellers. The general calmness and determination shown, however, had been an obvious word to the wise that any spate of sell- ing would be noticeably absent in yes- terday's dealings. That, indeed, was the case. Such scattered realisations as were encountered proved almost trifling in total. On the other hand, there were many inquiries for stocks and shares, and judging by the size of orders small investors and bargain hunters were in evidence. There was little indication of institutional opera- tions. In view of the new rule that deal- ings must be only for cash, jobbers in some instances were not always able to supply the stock desired. They could not sell short as they would dur- ing an Account when there would be time for stock to come in. But as a whole the market met the demand satisfactorily through a process of marrying orders. Parcels of the leaders were negotiated without much trouble, and prices were quoted in a large list of other securities. Some of these were a little lower than those ruling on Thursday last, but there were quite a few standing at higher levels. No difficulty was experienced in dealing in gilt-edged securities, which continued to be quoted rather more widely than usual, and prices were a shade above the minima fixed on 25th August. The establishment unofficially of minimum quotations for Home Railway prior charge stocks at but little below Thursday's levels is also significant of the steadiness which characterised markets as a whole. While yesterday's business should not be interpreted too optimistically, because dealers were evidently feeling their way cautiously and the public disposition has still to be put to the full test, there seems a strong likeli- hood that business will be attracted increasingly to markets as the days go by, especially after the Settlement a fortnight hence is out of the way. That dealers are eager to fulfil their role in the functioning of the greatest security market in the world is evidenced by the throng that gathered to transact business in Throgmorton Street, the one available common meeting ground. They occu- pied the Street only temporarily before being \"moved on.\" This demonstra- tion of the desirability, to put it no stronger, of reopening the House, together with widely voiced support fo:' a return to the market proper, has doubtless weighted the scale in favour of the Committee's welcome decision to take that course to-morrow. The physical difficulties of dealing will then be removed. Should a healthy and reasonably good market develop, as is likely, a strong case could be made out for some relaxation of the temporary restrictions on free deal- ings.",

   "text_content" : "London's financial machinery has commenced to function again, but the methods to be followed are widely different from those of less than a week ago. Business was in progress in both gold and the foreign exchanges yester- day, but now it is canalised in accord- ance with the Treasury controlling orders, and as the centralising agent the Bank of England dominates the field. It is not surprising that in prevailing conditions the only exchanges to show any semblance of activity were those which must be sold to the authori- ties and for which the rates are officially fixed. What did surprise a good many people was the low level of the sterling- dollar quotation. It had been fully expected that a higher value would be given to the pound than that of 4.02-4.06 assigned to it, but obviously there must have been in the minds of the authorities other considerations which overrode that of maintaining the purchasing power of sterling abroad. There are potent forces making for the depreciation of the pound at this junc- ture, but no rush for dollars is in evidence, and the rate may be varied as chaneging conditions dictate. A corol- lary to the cheapening of the pound was a further addition of 8s to the price of gold, taking it to the new record of 168s per fine ounce. Silver is conspicuous as still enjoying a free market, and it may hold this distinction for some time to come. Disturbed conditions have stimulated a new demand for the metal, indicated yesterday by a rise of id to 201d per ounce for cesh, but there is a big gap between this price and the 48jd at ] I I I III I I I [ I â¢ i .. . . . ..... . I which it was fixed in 1918-that is, after war had been in progress four years. There is no sign yet whether history will repeat itself and allow silver a long run ajain, but meantime experience as a whole yesterday showed freedom in pleasant contrast to control. A lot of time was absorbed in master- ing the details of the new arrange- ments, the forms to be filled up and the particulars to be given by applicants requiring exchange for different pur- poses, but it may be anticipated that the adaptability which has characterised the general change from peace to war conditions will not be lacking in this case.",

   "text_content" : "The maintenance of the 4 per cent. interim dividend on Cammell Laird Ordinary might have been expected, in spite of the nature of the company's work. The company has been conserva- tive in regard to dividends since the beginning of recovery in 1935. For 1938-39 the total of 10 per cent. on the Ordinary was within 0.3 per cent. of being twice earned. Mr. W. L. Hichens, the chairman, when he reviewed the outlook last April, took a fairly optimis- tic view of business. The Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company has participated in the supply of rolling stock to Turkey under the export credits granted to that country, while the English Steel Corporation has bene- sited by rearmament demand added to a cyclical revival. Assuming, on a conservative reading of the situation, that the company maintains the final dividend at 6 per cent., the shares would yield slightly over 7 per cent. at the last quoted price of around 7s.",

   "text_content" : "In the short period since the incor- poration of the National Industrial Credit Corporation in South Africa in 1937 the company has amply demon- strated its usefulness. A further ad- vance of earnings in the second year of operation, ended on 30th June last, has brought the net profit up by Â£3,300 to Â£25,600. The Ordinary dividend is raised to 6J per cent., against 5 per cent. for the first trading period of just under a year. Dividends are sub- ject to income-tax at the rate of 3s 3d in the Â£1. The bigger margin permits of an increase in the allowance for contingencies from Â£3,000 to Â£4,000, and Â£5,400 is again written off prelimi- nary and issue expenses, leaving Â£600 more at Â£7,500 to go forward. An idea of the growth of the busi- ness during the year may be gathered from the increase of Â£116,800 to Â£899,600 in hire-purchase agreements, while on the other side of the accounts the bankers' loan, secured on certain of these agreements and on the uncalled capital, has gone up from Â£303,100 to Â£338,200. Total assets are now Â£912,700, against Â£803,600. The development of a business on such a substantial scale, starting from scratch only two years ago, indicates the appreciation of the trading com- munity in South Africa of a means of solving the problem of buying on short and selling on long terms.",

Net profit of Trojan (Hold- ings) last year was Â£19,600 against Â£19,800, but the small reduction is due entirely to the fact that only Â£400 is added from income-tax refund, against Â£1,000 from that source and invest- ment suspense a year ago. Actually the main subsidiary, Trojan, contri- buted Â£22,000 against Â£21,100. Trojan (Holdings) is able to repeat the dividend of 10 per cent. for the third time, and to carry forward a few hundreds less at Â£600. Figures of the balance-sheet are almost identical with those of the previous year. The interest in the Trojan subsidiary, taking the investment and advances together, stands at Â£245,700. The in- terest in Beans Industries stands at Â£69,250, with a value at the mean quotation of Â£55,000 against Â£60,000 a year ago.",

   "text_content" : "A small decline in profit of the Trans- vaal Mattress and Furnishing Company reflects the lower level of business activity in South Africa during the past year, but does not detract from the generally satisfactory result of the year's operations. The net figure is Â£2,400 less at Â£34,900, and the dividend is maintained at 12J per cent., with a good margin. The difference is made up partly by a reduction from Â£5,000 to Â£4,000 in the amount written off good- will, but the transfer to general reserve remains at Â£4,000. By the transfer from revenue general reserve is brought up to Â£14,000, and capital reserve is evened up by a few pounds to Â£6,500. Goodwill has now been written down to Â£21,000. Stonk and work in progress have risen by the substantial amount of Â£15,900 to Â£122,700, but debtors are Â£5,800 down at Â£87,700. The cash item is also lower at Â£13,500, against Â£18,100. Some contraction of business is intelligible in view of the slower movement of in- dustry in South Africa during the past year.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Basis for Dealing in Foreign Exchange",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "The basis on which n foreign exchange is to be permitted has now been established. Authorised dealers, whose close co- operation with the Bank of England has been sought, have been permitted to sell exchange to other banks or to the public provided they are satisfied that such transactions come within the permitted headings. As explained in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, exchange can be made available to enable a contract made before the date, on which the Defence (Finance) Regulations came into force to be complied with; to meet reasonable requirements of a business carried on in the United Kingdom; and to defray reasonable travelling or other personal expenses. Applications not falling under these headings or unsupported by satisfac- tory evidence must be referred to the Bank of England. It is understood that arrangements have been made whereby the Bank of England will notify authorised dealers of spot and forward exchange rates. This will probably be done daily. NORMAL RELATIONS The Bank is to open accounts in the currencies with the authorised dealers who have been advised to preserve normal relations with their foreign correspondents. Responsibility is to be accepted by the Bank of England for balances held by dealers with their foreign corre- spondents as its agents. Foreign balances held by dealers for their own account will not be so covered. To prevent disturbances in the London Money market or in other centres the Bank will, if convenient, sell spot exchange to the dealers and buy back for forward delivery. SPECIFIED CURRENCIES Regarding sales of specified cur- rencies, it has been provided that- At the close of business each day each authorised dealer will advise the Bank of the total amount sold; At the commencement of business on the following day dealers have been asked to hand the Bank a statement of the previous day's transactions; On the value date authorised, dealers are to debit the Bank of Eng- land's currency account with the amount sold. The Bank will then debit the authorised dealer's account with the sterling equivalent. Com- pleted declarations will be forwarded to the Bank. WEEKLY ACCOUNTS Similar procedure has been laid down for purchases of specified cur- rencies. Apart from forward trans- actions all exchange dealings between the Bank of England and authorised dealers will be booked as spot con- tracts. It has been arranged that state- ments of currency accounts should be forwarded weekly to the Bank. As to commission, it is provided that authorised dealers doing business with a bank which is not an authorised dealer will be remuner- ated by the Bank of England at an agreed rate. Declarations covering such operations should be stamped \"Commissioh due \" and kept separate from other deals. Commissions may be claimed monthly. STERLING FIXED AT $4.02-$4.06 OFFICIAL CONTROL OF MARKET The various sections of the Money market reopened yesterday under the new conditions created by the Defence of the Realm regulations which bring the markets generally under official control. Interest centred mainly in the foreign exchanges, owing to the fact that rates are now fixed by the authorities. Operations in the market were conducted through the authorised dealers, a list of whom was given in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday. Considerable surprise was expressed when it was announced that the first \"pegged\" rate for sterling on New York was to be $4.02 to $4.06. The general view was that this rate was unduly low and presented too great a profit to those who had been long of dollars. NEW REGULATIONS Dealers reported a large number of inquiries, but these mainly concerned the application of the new regulations. Banks were inundated with questions arising from the complicated nature of the many forms which, under cer- tain circumstances, now have to be filled in. Actual business transacted was described as modest. And there was no disconcerting rush to get into or out of dollars. Some days must elapse before the market becomes attuned to the new state of affairs. So far as other currencies were con- cerned, the Canadian dollar was actually fixed more favourably to sterling at $4.47 to $4.51, as compared with $4.36J middle before the declaration of war. Among Continentals, Dutch guilders and Belgian belgas were officially fixed at rates considerably more favourable to the pound than those ruling on Satur- day, thus severing to some extent the dollar link. French francs, on the other hand, were called 174 to 175 to the Â£, as com- pared with 1758, while Swedish crowns, Norwegian kroner and Argentine pesos were appreciably dearer. LOMBARD STREET NORMAL Lombard Street was also untram- melled by official regulations and func- tioned quite normally. Creditconditions were relatively comfortable, but some banks had to call from the market. Other institutions, however, were lenders. No change took place in loan rates, while discount quotations were as before the outbreak of hostilities with the three months bank draft at 3+8 per cent. It was announced yesterday that the following banks have been added to those authorised to deal in all foreign exchanges: The National Bank, the Belfast Bank, the Bank of Ulster and the Provincial Bank of Ireland.

   "text_content" : "OGETHER with places of enter- tainment and sports meetings, the Stock Exchange remained closed yesterday. In their keenness to create a market and give the public facilities for deal- ing, members created a problem for the authorities. They congregated in Throgmorton Street in such numbers as to contra- vene the Lord Privy Seal's request that crowds should not gather together \"unnecessarily in any circumstances.\" It was for this reason that the Street market was dispersed after midday by the police. Alfresco Market It was the Committee's intention that members and their staffs should attend at their offices. By dealing in the Street rather than by telephone members created an embarrassing situation. Some dealers gave the alfresco market an extra touch of realism by chalking on the sand bags lining the pavement the numbers of their usual dealing stands. An obvious butt for witticisms was the portable miniature bathing pool placed in Drapers' Gardens for fire- fighting purposes. Sir Andrew Duncan AS Controller of iron and steel under the Ministry of Supply Sir Andrew Duncan will have a task different from that allotted him in the last war. He was then appointed secretary of the Merchant Shipbuilding Advisory Committee to the Shipping Controller. He subsequently became joint secre- tary to the Admiralty Shipbuilding Council under Sir Eric Geddes, who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. After the war Sir Andrew became Coal Controller, holding the office until the formation of the Mines Department in 1920. For nearly five years Sir Andrew has been chairman of the executive committee of the British Iron and Steel Federation, a position that made him a \"natural\" for his present appointment.

   "text_content" : "The third ordinary general meeting of Oxley Engineering Company, Ltd., was held yesterday in Leeds. MR. H. H. HOLLIS (chairman and managing director), who presided, said: Our second full year's trading has, as forecast in my speech last year, well main- tained the exceptionally high profit- earning record of your company. The net earnings represent a rate of 32.5 per cent. on the issued capital, against 32.8 per cent. earned last year. Unfortunately, in addition to increased appropriations to meet the burden of taxation, we have found it necessary to create a substantial reserve against bad debts, so that the profit available for divi- dend is Â£16,544, against a figure of Â£18,325 available last year. A comparison of the balance-sheet now before you with that submitted last year will show that this profit has been utilised as follows: - In acquiring or improving fixed assets, Â£6,768; in paying the dividend declared at our last meeting, Â£7.250; in writing down preliminary expenses, Â£1,895; maintained in cash or its equivalent, Â£631-Â£16,544. I have pleasure in submitting for your approval the recommendations of the direc- tors, which may be explained as follows:- 1. The cost of completing the extensions of the works and offices, and of increasing our plant and tackle to cope with the ex- panding turnover, has amounted to Â£6,768. This expenditure has provided your com- pany with shops, offices and plant compar- able with any in the engineering trade. Having regard, however, to the near cer- tainty of still further increases on the de- mands on our liquid resources, your Board recommend that the sum of Â£6,000 be placed to reserve to maintain those liquid resources at their present level. 2. That a further Â£2,000 be applied to writing down the value of preliminary expenses. This item will then appear in the balance-sheet at Â£4,000. Your directors, anticipating the main- tenance of the profit-earning capacity of the company, and at the same time ex- pecting a substantial reduction in capital expenditure, recommend the maintenance of the dividend at 12% per cent. per annum. SATISFACTORY CONTRACTS In my address last year, I referred to a contract which we were carrying out for the erection of three large arc welded storage tanks for one of the leading oil companies. I am pleased to be able to report that we were able to give our clients a first-class job. That the work- manship was highly satisfactory is evidenced by the fact that we have now received a further order comprising four more tanks from the same clients. We are actively engaged in building arc welded oil storage tanks, many repeat orders having been received. Orders for gasworks plant during the year have been satisfactory, and gas- holders to our patented design are at pre- sent in course of erection. In addition, our operators have been exceptionally busy during this period in carrying out repairs to gasholders by arc welding, and our ser- vices for this specialised work are likely to be in great 'demand. The extension of our works premises have now been substantially completed, and accordingly we shall be able to in- crease the output of all departments. Our homogeneous lead coating department is particularly active. We anticipate increas- ing inquiries in the future for stainless steel vessels, and also for the applica- tion of sprayed limpet asbestos in con- nection with gasworks plant. It is with very great pleasure that I take this opportunity of again placing on record an appreciation of the loyalty and co-operation of our officials, staff and workpeople during the past 12 months, and in the not too distant future my col- leagues on the Board and myself intend to inaugurate a staff pension scheme, and hope to be able to make a definite report in this connection next year. The report and accounts were adopted, also the payment of a dividend of 12% per cent. less tax.",

   "text_content" : "Of the further Rand mining profits for August available yesterday, those of the Union Corporation group were the only ones to contain the usual full details of tonnage, revenue, costs and profits. The other returns, as with those of the Central Mining-Rand Mines group, published in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, gave profit figures only, although the Anglo American Corporation companies also added tonnage details. Revenue has been based on a gold price of 148s per ounce for the seventh succes- sive month, the bulk of the mines' gold output for August having been sold at this level despite the sharp spurt in the sterling price of gold during the closing days of the period. In the Union Corporation group all round records were established by East Geduld, together with Grootvlei and Van Dyk among the more recently established producers. Most of the mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated group earned rather more than in July, but the only record profit was put up by East Champ d'Or. Among the Anglo American Corpora- tion concerns, new peak profits were earned by South African Land (\"Sallies\"), Daggafontein and West Springs. Against the loss of Â£23,753 from the first month's working of the mine, East Daggafontein made a profit of Â£4,482 in August.

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The banks reopened to the general public yesterday and business was described as tranquil and relatively normal. Bank employees were still busily engaged in assimilating the many new regulations, while they had the additional task of explaining numerous points to clients. To the credit of the general public it must be said that there was no abnormal rush to withdraw cash. Certain banks had demands made upon them for currency and were forced in their turn to call from the market, but other institutions had the opposite experience and were able to lend quite freely. Nor was there any undue rush to offer gold and gold coins to the banks, neither was there a steady flow of orders. It will be some days neces- sarily before the public at large grasp the new situation. British nationals have not been large hoarders and there has already been dishoarding. Most bankers yesterday expressed confidence that a highly satisfactory response from the public will be forthcoming. Certainly the price yes- terday was attractive enough to tempt metal and coins. Exchange Control As far as the foreign exchanges were concerned the new regulations cer- tainly demanded consideration. The opinion was expressed that as the many forms had been drawn up long ago they should have been submitted to experts in the market for comment. Operations in the exchanges were conducted through the authorised dealers but several points arose which were not sufficiently covered in the regulations and by the memorandum issued to dealers. Business was limited, but a few days must elapse before matters settle down. Great surprise was expressed at the official rate of $4.02 to $4.06 fixed for sterling. Few people had foreseen a quotation below that prevailing before the new currency regulations were passed; most people expected the rate to be more favourable to sterling. It was contended that too much has been given away to those who either by accident or design were long of dollars. Not many days since the authorities were ready sellers of spot dollars at $4.68a and of three months forward dollars at a- fair premium. Some operators, therefore, have been presented with the handsome profit of more than 60 cents. It may be, of course, that the authorities are desirous to attract 'people back to sterling. It is believed that the official quo- tations for the U.S. dollar and other currencies will be varied, not neces- sarily from day to day. In this connection the view prevails that because of the cost of imports the adjustments should be upward. It was announced yesterday that value dates for all currencies will be three business days instead of two as hitherto. There was criticism of the wide spread between buying and selling rates but these may be narrowed as time passes. Authorised dealers were given permission to charge a commis- sion of J per cent., this being equiva- lent to about half-a-cent in the dollar rate. Forward Contracts Official quotations yesterday were for spot business; there are no for- ward rates, but it is understood that if it is convenient to all parties con- cerned the Bank of England will sell spot exchange to authorised dealers and buy back for forward delivery. Existing forward contracts, it is thought, will go through without hitch on the filling in of forms, but after three months the open position will be largely liquidated. No indication was given as to what the basis was for fixing gold yester- day. After allowing for the increased charges and war risks, it was calcu- lated that the new record price of 168s per fine ounce is near to or at a moderate discount on the theoretical parity."

   "article_dc_title" : "Stock Exchange to Reopen To-Morrow",
   "paper_dcterms_temporal" : "National Daily",
   "text_content" : "The London Stock Exchange reopens to-morrow. This de- cision was made known by the Committee last evening after members had left the City, and the first intimation they had was in the 6 p.m. B.B.C. news bulletin. The Committee's announcement was the bald one that the House would reopen, and was unaccompanied by any explanatory information. The decision has been reached with the full cognisance and approval of the authorities. The House will open at the usual hour, but the closing time may be the subject of a further announcement. The impression is that, as the banks are closing at 2 p.m., the House will shut its doors before the normal time of 4 p.m. The decision to reopen the House, which has been closed since Thursday last, will give satisfaction to a considerable number of members who yesterday were agitating for such a move. INTER-OFFICE METHOD UNSATISFACTORY Although there was much feeling that the Floor of the House should be made available for the transaction of business instead of the present unsatisfactory inter-office method, no organised protest was lodged with the Committee. It is expected that the Committee will to-day make avail- able new regulations for the carrying on of business from to- morrow. The temporary regulations in force govern transactions pending the reopening of the House. Among these is the stipula- tion that bargains in gilt-edged securities must not be done below the minimum prices set out in the Official Lists of 31st August last. An early revision of these minima in the light of the new conditions is anticipated. FAIR BUSINESS TRANSACTED There was a big response yesterday to the Committee's message to members that they should reopen their offices and resume business. Security dealings were carried on in the Street and by telephone between brokers' and jobbers' offices. Business in all cases was a matter of negotiation. In the aggregate a fair number of deals was put through. The gilt- edged section provided the nearest approach to a free market. The C.la(nqnw tnlr r.nlir. -. I --------. .... The Glasgow Stock Exchange re- opened yesterday. Dealings were on very small lines, and prices largely nominal. Dublin also resumed busi- ness, dealings being confined to Irish securities. There was no afternoon session. The Stock Exchanges at Bristol, Edinburgh and Liverpool remained closed. Reopening of other markets begins to-day. The London Metal Exchange is opening at noon for the liquidation of open contracts, though no new con- tracts will be permitted. At a meeting of the Committee of the Mincing Lane Tea and Rubber Share Brokers' Association held yesterday it was decided to reopen the Mincing Lane Stock Exchange at Plantation House, E.C.3, as from to- day. Business hours will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Settlement and deal- ing regulations will be in accordance with the London Stock Exchange Emergency Regulations. OFFICIAL LISTS Now Suspended Official lists will be suspended until further notice, and in the event of the City becoming untenable the emer- gency address of the association will be that of the secretary, Mr. C. H. R. Whitehorn, 17, Holmbrook-drive, Hendon, N.W.4. (Telephone: Hendon 7046.) The Rubber Trade Association, Oils and Oilseeds markets will reopen to- morrow. Streets around the Stock Exchange which had been almost completely deserted since Thursday last resumed their normal active appearance yesterday. Throgmorton-street was actually more crowded than usual in the morning, for with the House closed large numbers of members and clerks congregated there to transact business and to discuss personal experiences during the eventful four days that most of them had been away from the City. CONGESTED STREET Market Stopped Transactions were carried on to a fair extent in this Street market from about 10 a.m. until 1.45 p.m., when the police were.forced to take action. There were two grounds for their breaking up this market, the congregation of a large number of people in a small area, which is in- advisable at present, and the severe hindrance to traffic. With the termination of the Street market, business was continued between offices by telephone. The Emergency Committee continued in session throughout yesterday and although it devoted a considerable amount of time to necessary detail work there was prac- tically no call for the issue of rules and regulations, the House having been well prepared in this direction. Only one notice was issued during the time members were in the City and this announced that until there was a further change the latest time for delivering all securities would be 12.45 p.m. This action was prompted by the closing of the banks at 2 p.m. instead of the usual 3.30 p.m. The delivery of securities commences at 10 a.m. and hitherto has ended for the bulk of issues at 1.45 p.m. The Committee's staff was kept exceed- ingly busy handing out copies of the tem- porary regulations governing the carrying on of business while the House remains closed and in answering the many ques- tions arising therefrom. Good progress was also made towards the completion of the compilation of the list of temporary addresses of members for use in the event of business in the City becoming impos- sible. There is a prospect that this list will be circulated almost immediately. Throughout yesterday the London houses of New York brokers found little business passing through their hands. With dealings in American securities _ ... subject to Treasury regulations the normal London interest in an active American market was impossible. New York brokers also reported that applications to the Treasury for permission to sell American securities were few. Pre- sumably the time has not yet arrived for the liquidation of American securities held in this country. In view of the restrictions under which it was made, yesterday's attempt by Stock Exchange members to create a market in securities was fairly successful. The fact that business had to be con- ducted in Throgmorton-street and by tele- phone between offices was one impediment. Another was the difficulty of contacting those who had left limits to buy or sell. Since dealing was so largely a matter of negotiation, uncertainty as to limits given before Thursday, when the \" House \" was last open, created considerable trouble and was a serious hindrance to business. A further restriction was the need for adjustment to new conditions and the accu- mulation of correspondence after some brokers' offices had been closed for several days. Industrial jobbers found another prob- lem in the postponement of the End- August Settlement to 21st September and the institution of cash dealings. This meant that special arrangements regard- ing delivery had often to be made before stock bought for the End-August Settle- ment could be sold. The problem seems to have been met in various ways by different firms of jobbers. PRICES LITTLE CHANGED Quotations Nominal Quotations throughout were nominal and in most cases showed little change from those existing on Thursday. In a few cases prices hardened on the activities of bargain hunters, but business of this kind was generally quite small. German and Austrian issues were marked down heavily in the Foreign mar- ket. Royal Dutch and American Indus- trials were adjusted to new currency values, Shipping shares were strong, and some Mines advanced well. Gilt-edged stocks were the most active market, but prices were reduced to about the minima recently fixed. INSCRIBED STOCK Suspension Effect Many offices were taken by surprise by the fact, emphasised in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday morning, that the Bank of England has indefinitely suspended the \"Inscribed stock\" system and will now transfer securities by deed only. This is necessitated by the removal of the Bank's transfer offices to Whitchurch, Hants. It is understood that the West- minster Bank will take a similar step within the next day or two, but that the National Provincial will continue for the present to transfer on personal attend- ance such \" Inscribed\" stocks as it is responsible for. The great advantage of the Inscribed stock system is that securities can be transferred for cash the same day as they are dealt in or any way the next day. If the owner has not wished to attend the bank in person he has been able to give a power of attorney, but that has involved a few days' wait. Presumably the transfer deeds for for- merly Inscribed stock will be \"certified\" by the Share and Loan Department, so that the chief delay in the new conditions will arise from the time taken in getting the transfers signed by clients in the pro- vinces. One leading firm of brokers had yesterday to deal with stock coming out of a deceased estate in Scotland, for the transfer of which several executors' signa- tures had to be obtained. In Scottish wi;ls there are sometimes as many as six execu- tors named. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1 Market Reports Page One. full list of yesterday's dealings Page Four",

   "text_content" : "As in the case of the foreign exchange market, dealings in gold took place yesterday on the basis of an officially fixed price, the normal procedure of a daily \" fixing \" by the bullion brokers at Messrs. N. M. Rothschilds being aban- doned. The official price was announced as 168s per fine ounce, a rise of 8s over the last \" normal \" market price of Friday, and a new high second. It was impos- sible to secure any estimate of turnover under the new conditions, but banks reported having had fair amounts of bullion offered to them. Only modest offerings of sovereigns were reported, the price being 39s 3d. Eagles were dealt in at 8s Id and Napoleons at 31s 2d. Taking the dollar buying rate of $4.06 and the sterling price of 168s the equiva- lent U.S. price was $34.11 per fine ounce and it was computed that the new price was at small discount.

   "text_content" : "Jobbers in Home Railway stocks yesterday fixed unofficial minimum prices for all prior charges--that is, all issues other than Ordinary shares. At the time of the recent fixing of minimum prices in the gilt-edged market, Home Rail jobbers considered taking similar steps. Yester- day's action was partly due to the fact I that gilt-edged minimum prices remained fixed, and partly because the terms on which the Government has acquired control of the railways are not yet known to the public. In view of the latter circumstance, jobbers thought it wise to protect holders against the effects of chance information or speculation. The levels chosen were, for the most part, the closing quotations of Thursday last. In some cases, for example, Great Western and Southern debentures, the prices quoted were Â£1 below Thursday's level, but, in general, the list was unaltered. BUSINESS SMALL Business in the prior charge stocks was not large, and leading firms of jobbers reported a total of five or six bargains for the day. Some buying inquiry for the Ordinary stocks, which are not controlled by the arrangement, came to the market. \" Brum\" Ordinary changed hands at Thursday night's level, and Great Western Ordinary was bought at slightly below its week-end quotation. All jobbers, with the exception of three small firms, agreed to the arrangement. It is not yet known for how long the pro- visions of the agreement will remain in effect, but some readjustment may be expected in the event of a Government pronouncement concerning the terms on which control of the railways has been acquired. The usual weekly railway traffics will not be announced to-day, and it is unlikely that these figures will again be published while the companies remain under Govern- ment control. In practice the four main lines and also the sections of the London Passenger Transport Board, which also has sus- pended the issue of traffic receipts, are working as one undertaking. What form the annual accounts will take is also uncertain. During the 1914-18 period a skeleton form of report and accounts was used. Some similar system will probably be adopted on this occasion. As stated in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yester- day, no announcement has yet been made as to the compensation to be paid the com- panies for the use of the railways.",

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 5th Sept. In the wildest trading ever witnessed in the New York Stock Exchange, prices bounded ahead from the opening, with Bethlehem Steel in the forefront. The market closed strong and 3 to 17 points higher, after absorbing substantial profit-taking in its stride. Turnover at 5,930,000 shares was the heaviest since October, 1937 (when 7,290,000 shares changed hands at falling prices). The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average was no less than 10.03 higher at 148.12. The Rails index jumped 2.78 to 28.96, that for Utilities only gaining 0.38 at 23.79. Shares in chief demand included Steels, Coppers, Aircrafts and Chemi- cals, also Sugars, Hides, Oils and Packings. Big blocks of shares changed hands. Of 957 individual stocks dealt in, 726 advanced, only 167 declined and 64 were unchanged. In the Bond market U.S. Government issues were weak and Rails irregular. Turnover in bonds totalled $58,610,000, in- cluding $48,680,000 in U.S. Governments- a new high record. COMMODITIES SPURT Most commodity markets advanced to the permissible limits. Domestic copper was sold at 12%c a pound, against the pre- vious ruling domestic price of 11c. Scrap copper rose Ic to 10%c, equivalent to 12c for the refined metal. Zinc gained %c at 5.75c a pound. Rubber futures spurted 2c- 5.35c a pound, cotton futures 38-54 points a pound. Wheat at Chicago and Winnipeg jumped the limit of 5c a bushel. MOODY'S commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was to-day 161.7, against 146.9 previously. Sterling opened lower at $4.02 to $4.06, but rallied to close at $4.08, a net fall of 14c. Silver was unchanged at 35/2c. Three Stock Exchange seats were sold to-day for $61,000, $63,000 and $65,000 respectively, compared with $60,000 pre- viously. WEEKLY STEEL OUTPUT DOWN Steel mill activity for the current week is at 58.6 per cent. of capacity, compared with 63 per cent. last week, or a fall of 4.4, reports the American Iron and Steel Institute. The decline is due to the Labour Day holiday on Monday.

The first to reflect the incidence of the war upon the various sections of industry will be published early in October. A considerable increase is anticipated in the numbers employed in defence trades, notwithstanding the fact that many of these industries have for some time been working near capacity, so the percentage of workless in them is already small. On the other hand there will probably be numerous additions to workless in the luxury and other non-essential trades. Many of these unemployed will be absorbed into the more active industries while others no doubt will join the fighting services or the civil defence units. On balance therefore it is probable that in the next few returns little change will be shown. Later, with the continued calls upon man-power for all purposes, the already pressing problem of the best and most economic and efficient use of labour of all kinds will again come to the forefront.",

An announce- ment to this effect was made yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufac- turers and Traders. Strenuous efforts are being made by the motor industry to adjust itself to emergency conditions. The future course of production is at present in a state of flux; the one thing that seems certain is that the normal commercial flow will be stemmed in the coming months and that a greater proportion of the industry's resources will tend to be applied to war purposes. Three outstanding problems confront the industry: supply of materials, export licenses and special Government contracts. STEEL REQUIREMENTS Upon the supply of raw materials de- pends the extent to which the capacity of the plants can be maintained. It is under- stood that representatives of the industry have been in close touch with the relative Government Departments and members of the supplying trades. Steel is one of the chief essential raw materials, and it is believed that the steel- makers have been trying to ascertain, in conjunction with the Ministry of Supply, to what extent the normal requirements of the motor industry and other industries can be met within the coming weeks. The motor trade recognises that any arrange- ments will be subject to frequent adjust- ment according to the state of the emer- gency and the competing claims of the war machine."

   "text_content" : "From our MARINE INSURANCE CORRESPONDENT The Government Cargo War Risk Office has issued an extended scale of rates for the insurance of cargoes. No change was made in' the rates fixed on Monday, details of which appeared in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday. As the new schedule now includes voyages to and through the Mediter- ranean, which is closed to British shipping by order of the Admiralty, it is thought that this may presage a lifting of the embargo shortly. It must be remembered, however, that the Government office covers British goods in neutral vessels as well as in British ships and that neutral vessels are not barred from Mediterranean trade. The rate for voyages to and from the United Kingdom to Mediterranean ports is fixed at 50s per cent. The rate for voyages to and from Australasia via the Mediterranean is fixed at 60s per cent. out and 70s per cent. home, as compared with rates of 50s per cent. out and 60s per cent. home via the Cape, and 40s per cent. out and 50s per cent. home via Panama. For Far Eastern voyages via the Mediterranean the rate is 80s out and 90s home, this being the new maximum of the scale. These rates compare with 60s per cent. to the Far East via the Cape and 70s home, the Panama route rates being 50s per cent. out and 60s per cent. home. NEW SCHEDULE In the European waters schedule new rates appear for Norwegian and Danish voyages, the full new schedule being as follows:- Rates for insurances of cargoes to and from U.K. by British and neutral steamers:- Out Il rne 1.

It is struck after setting aside Â£4,500 (against Â£3,864) for taxation. Earnings, after Preference dividend, were equal to 23.2 per cent. on the Â£150,000 of Ordinary capital. The total Ordinary dividend is again 12% per cent. The allocation to reserve of Â£4,000 is repeated, raising that account to Â£14,000, and capital reserve is increased to Â£6,500 by a transfer of Â£76. A sum of Â£4,000 (against Â£5,000) is written off goodwill, lowering that item to Â£21,000. The carry-forward is Â£4,222, a decrease of Â£218. The meeting will be held in Johannes- burg on 9th October at 2.30 p.m. Mr. G. Mackenzie is chairman. The 4s Ordinary shares were last quoted at 4s 6d. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 2",
