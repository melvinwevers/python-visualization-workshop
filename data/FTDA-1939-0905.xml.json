MONDAY Evening. With the declaration of a limited Bank Holiday to-day, the banks were closed to the general public, which meant that no actual business was transacted in either the foreign ex- change or discount markets. The banks, nevertheless, had a very active and busy day completing their emer- gency measures and assimilating the contents of the various forms issued in connection with the emergency financial measures and instructing branches. It is understood that, when and where possible, the banks granted facilities in respect of currency requirements. Certain members of the Discount market put in an appearance in the City for much the same reason as the banks. There were no transactions, loan arrangements being extended for one day automatically and the maturity of bills put forward one day. It was indicated that no change in bill rates is likely, particularly after the reassuring unofficial declarations in regard to bank rate. LoAs IASNCOUi PER CET. PER CESNT. PER CENT.

Exchange Control As indicated above, no dealings took place in Foreign Exchanges and in view of the control now vested in the authorities dealings such as those seen since the Great War will cease while Foreign Exchange brokers, as such, will no longer function. A list of banks authorised to deal in the various currencies has been formulated as well as forms to be used in the conduct of business. As far as sterling was concerned no rates, of course, were obtainable, but there was an indication from Paris, in which centre the pound was quoted at 175.55 and the dollar at 41.75. These rates gave an approximate.sterling-dollar quotation of around 4.25.",

   "text_content" : "Although the Stock Exchange will remain closed to-day, the statement issued by the Committee last night and given on Page Two makes it cer- tain that members and their staffs will be in the City in force. The Committee's statement left no doubt that as free a market as possible is to be established without using the Stock Exchange. Dealing by telephone presents obvious difficulties, but these arise mainly from the fact that such transactions have never yet become highly developed on the Stock Tixchange. Business takes place. by. tele- phone after any normal day's activities, but the \"over the telephone\" market is enerally less flexible than dealing during Stock Exchange hours. Nevertheless, as pointed out in THE FINANCIAL TIMES on Saturday, the tele- phone is the normal method of conducting foreign exchange business. Moreover, the telephone has been used very successfully in security dealings between Stock Ex- changes in different parts of the country. Within a short time, therefore, the volume of business done between Stock Exchange offices and the freedom of mar- kets may be expected to meet the imme- diate requirements of the investing public. Even last week those requirements had been greatly restricted by political uncer- tainties. PRICES OF GILT-EDGED As far as the gilt-edged market is con- cerned, the maintenance of minimum quotations, decided upon by the Committee yesterday, sets a limit beyond which gilt- edged stocks cannot fall. It may be recalled that when the House closed on Thursday many British Government stocks had risen well above their minima. Two and a-Half per Cent. Consols finished at 64Y against a fixed price of 62%, War Loan at 90% against 88%, and Conversion Three and a- Half per Cent. at 89% against 87%. Conditions have changed since last week by an actual state of war, and markets to-day will therefore have to adjust them- selves to the new circumstances. It by no means follows that any general decline will take place. In other Stock Exchange markets, not at present subject to fixed minimum prices, last week's demand seemed to be stimu- lated to some extent by apprehension of war. The behaviour of markets to-day will therefore provide an interesting reflection of reactions to actual war condi- tions. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1",

   "text_content" : "While it will be the hardest of tasks to-day for any of us to bring our minds to humdrum business, yet it will be recognised that just as was found in 1914-18 the Stock Exchange is indis- pensable to the smooth workipg of the finance of war. Members will have to feel their way through the \" black out\" to the light which all feel assured now lies ahead-however long and arduous the path to it. Dealings between offices will doubt- less be at first of a small and tentative character. The main object will be to organise a market upon which investors can make any necessary sales and so gradually create the conditions in which H.M. Government can readily borrow the millions upon millions which it will require to carry the war to a successful conclusion and thereafter reap ade- quately the fruits of a durable peace. Gold Price Problem It would clearly. be impossible under war-time regulations to permit free exchange dealings. As to what dollar rate will be adopted for the time being much interest is felt. The recent momentary dip in sterl- ing to $4.10 was certainly exaggerated. Something between that and the $4.68 average of late months will presum- ably be adopted. As we all know, the United States' price of gold is fixed at $35 per fine ounce. Here is the gross sterling equivalent of that quotation at various exchange rates:- Exchange Gold Exchange Gold rate parity rate parity $ sd $ s d 4.10 ... 170 9 4.40 ... 159 0 4.20 ... 166 8 4.50 ... 155 6 4.30 ... 162 10 4.60 ... 153 9 Until last week it would have sufficed to deduct.. about Is from any of the above gross gold prices to arrive at what was called the \"New York shipping parity.\" This was what an arbitrageur could expect to receive net for gold sent to New York, after allowing for freight, insurance and the U.S.-Mint charge. Possible Pegs Last week all normal calculations went by the board. Ordinary arbitra- geurs could not risk buying gold when they could not be sure of shipping it, or of the cost of freight and insurance. The price last fixed, that of Friday, 1st September, was the round Â£8 per ounce, which was about 5s 6d discount below the theoretical parity. Therefore, should the Treasury peg the New York rate at, say, $4.50, a price of 150s per fine ounce (155s 6d gross less 5s 6d costs of realisation) would not be an unreasonable one for the authorities to allow to sellers of gold. By a coincidence this would be exactly the price which the South African Government has determined shall be the maximum the Rand gold producers are to be entitled to retain in the future. Rand Records The \"Corner House\" is the first of the Kaffir groups to announce the profits of its subsidiaries for August. For the seventh successive month the value of the gold has been taken at 148s per ounce-the basis on which the in- dustry was able to pay the record divi- dend of over Â£9,500,000 for the first half of this year. Even on the above conservative gold value, the East Rand Proprietary and the Modder East were able to earn record profits for the past month. The City Deep's Â£39,500 for August is Â£4,400 more than for July and must be the highest for any month for several years past. In February, City Deep were recommended here at 38s 9d for a gradual rise in dividends to at least 4s a year. The last price of the shares is around Â£2. The June dividend was raised to is 6d, and all going well there should be a further advance in next December's declaration. rbt Utarint",

A further order concerns the control of supplies and prices of jute, raw and waste, jute cuttings, jute yarns and jute twists, and such control will be exercised by a Department known as \" The Jute Control.\" As soon as the supply position of jute warrants it permission to resume dealings will be permitted, subject to such condi- tions as will be specified. Any such con- dition will be subjected to powers of requisition which will in no case be at prices exceeding the specified maximum prices. Particulars of the specified materials must be furnished. Communrications should be addressed to the Jute Control, Ministry of Supply, c/o the Postmaster, Dundee. OTHER COMMODITIES The Ministry of Supply has also under- taken the control of copper, lead, and zinc, fixing maximum prices, and prohibiting the export of these metals unwrought and of non-ferrous scrap metal, Further, the control of supplies and prices of molasses and industrial alcohol and of substances -normally produced from molasses or industrial alcohol.

   "text_content" : "The Stock Exchange Emergency Sub-Committee is in constant session and is dealing with the mass of work to which the outbreak of war has given rise. The hiatus of yesterday, caused by the temporary \"Bank Holi- day\" at the banks, gave the City a semi-deserted appearance in what New York calls the financial district. A few firms of jobbers attended at their offices. They received occasional inquiries for their views and nominal prices. In some cases, the broker who wanted to buy or sell was informed that his desire should be duly noted and that, when matters settled down a little, it might become possible to negotiate business. Stock Exchange Committee Notices Official notification of Stock Ex- change emergency regulations is being made through the wireless and the newspapers. (It is odd to recall that we had no broadcasting in 1914.) What prices are likely to be, when the markets reassemble, it is impos- sible to say. The scale of minimum prices fixed by the Consol market appears to afford, at least for the moment, a reasonable list in view of the fact that quotations current last Thursday stood well above the minimp in a fair number of cases. Other markets will closely watch the pro- cedure adopted by the Consol market. Foreign -Securities The magnitude of the task under- taken by the Bank of England in com- piling a register of the holders of Americans, and other specified foreign issues, is colossal. Stock Exchange brokers, bankers and other financial agents are already experiencing the early effects of a job that has to be completed within a month from the date of its first advertisement. Holders of such stocks can assist in the smooth running of this national compilation by giving strict attention to the accuracy and the fulness of the information to be entered on the forms. The Open Account Familiarity with Stock Exchange phrases is liable to lead those who use them into assuming that everyone else is fully acquainted with their mean- ing. Yet the \"open account,\" to which so many references are now being made, is not understanded of all the people, as clients' inquiries show. To the Stock Exchange mind, the \"open account\" usually represents the speculative position and the amount of stock and shares that is being carried over in the markets. In a wider sense, the \"open account\" can include all transactions, pur- chases, sales, options, that are un- settled at the time the phrase is used. The more limited application may be regarded as the generally accepted meaning. A light \"open account,\" like that of to-day, is susceptible of easy hand- ling and settlement. A heavy \"open account,\" such as obtained in August, 1914, may hold almost unknown pos- sibilities of danger and liability. Kiddies in the Crises Standing on the platform of Man- sion House District Railway station, watching the train-windows out of which peered the faces of little children dragged into war by Herr Hitler, one could not but remember the Belgian refugee kiddies who crowded the Rotunda of the Bank of England in 1914. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street mothered the women and child- ren, fed them with buns and milk, gave them seats to rest on, while the older folk exchanged their foreign money into British currency. It was a sight worthy of being perpetuated by a panel in the Royal Exchange; be needed to be made of pretty stern stuff who could watch, unmoved, either that pitiful pilgrimage or the evacuation of our little folks whose transport closed the door of the Stock Exchange last Friday. Stock Exchange \" Offices\" Emergency excuses everything, even such a departure from the Stock Ex- change tradition that members are now allowed to have business quarters outside the area which, roughly speak- ing, lies within a quarter-mile radius of the House. This tradition it is which has forbidden members of the Stock Exchange to open offices in the West End, in the Suburbs or Pro- vinces; a convention whoseprudence has frequently been challenged in the past, but which, so far as one knows, has not been broken within the last 100 years. The addresses with which some brokers have invited their clients to communicate are mostly, of course, the private houses of partners in the firms. .D~DNS COMPANY LA fIWRAISEICE An AlphabetiCail Gulild By STANLEY BORRIE, Soiliitor lth Aitimon 12. 1d mets by poet 1le 2d JORDAN so0NsLt.,llSchaonuyan,san,, doWO. & nasE irequentiy oeen cnaij engea in tneS~ paBst, but which, so' far as one knows, hsnot been broken within the last 100 years.

   "text_content" : "To-day Stock Exchange business is being resumed, though not yet on the Floor of the House. Now that the traffic congestion caused by initial evacuation movements has ceased, jobbers, brokers and their attenuated staffs are free to return to the City. The House itself remains closed in accordance with Government wishes, the Treasury, it is understood, being of the opinion that a gradual return to normality is best. Business will be conducted between offices as freely as the absence of a common meeting ground permits. So far as can be judged the handicap should not be considerable until transactions mount in volume. Suspension of the func- tions of the security markets has been of very short duration, actually only two working days. Now an integral part of the financial machinery of the country is being put into motion once more. Although very dissimilar from the action taken in 1914, the closing and reopening of the security markets then and now have one thing in common. All bargains must be for cash, and may not be continued from day to day or otherwise. This is a sensible precaution aimed at the pre- vention of speculation. It is not detrimental to the interests of legiti-. mate investors, whether they desire to employ money in the purchase of stocks and shares or wish to realise their holdings. This stipulation that all dealings must be for cash is probably the most important of the temporary regulations to govern the transaction of business drawn up by the Committee pending the reopening of the Stock Exchange. Deals to close forward contracts and continuations will be permitted, in order to clear up the existing non-cash transactions. Minimum prices for British Govern- ment securities and other stocks fall- ing within the gilt-edged category were fixed on 25th August and this system will be maintained, with power to the Committee to vary the list as circumstances may dictate. These and the other temporary regu- lations, which include the prohibition of business in new issues until the latter have been approved by the Treasury and dealings specially allowed by the Committe3, are de- signed to afford a healthy securities market and to promote a resumption of genuine investment business. They also constitute a safeguard against the possibility of panic selling, of which, however, there had been no sign up to last Thursday. The postponement of the Settlement for this coming Thurs- day until 21st September affords a breathing space in which to overcome any temporary difficulties. Contango rates for the extended period will be based on alterations in Ban: Rate and will, presumably, be higher as a con- sequence. Securities undelivered in respect of bargains outstanding at the end-August Account, settlement of which was suspended, have now to be paid for. Under these regulations business in securities should function well enough in conditions of emergency, but if the volume gives signs of expan- sion the reopening of the House and freer dealings should be delayed as little as possible.",

   "text_content" : "The dominance of the national in- terest is the motive running through all the many financial Orders and Regula- tions now being made. In their execu- tion the convenience of the individual must sometimes be ignored, one among the painful necessities of concentrating our economic strength and resources on the successful prosecution of the war. This aspect is particularly marked in the strict control of gold and foreign exchange. The Treasury must be able to command the means of paying for purchases abroad, but the regulations now made give every evidence of the traditional British respect for under- takings given. Thus only residents in the United Kingdom-and not foreigners holding gold or securities here for safe custody-are called upon to sell them to the authorities. Settle- ment of pre-war debts to foreigners (but not to enemy creditors) will be facilitated. The control of the capital market does in the home sphere what the regulation of the exchanges does in regard to overseas business. The Government will havi to boriow heavily in course of time to finaner the conduct of the war. It must have first call upon the funds available, and therefore any issue involving the sub- scription of new money will only be permitted if the Treasury is satisfied that it is in the national interest. It would be possible to enumerate many industries which will be working at top speed to supply munitions of war, and which conceivably might need to raise more capital. Obviously they would have the strongest of claims to be allowed to do so, but they would be confronted immediately with the ques- tion of the form such an issue should take. Over-expansion of fixed capital is a thing to be avoided, for large amounts have had to be written off in the last twenty years as the result of the transition from boom to depres- sion. Redeemable securities of rela- tively short term seem to offer a solution of the problem. They would be reduced, if not eliminated, while profits were at their maximum and in- flation of the balance-sheet would be avoided. This is a matter upon which, as and when it arises, the guidance of the authorities should be given, as it has been given to numerous industrial undertakings in recent years.",

   "text_content" : "The latest Kaffir returns are less informative than usual, though they are not lacking in interest. The figures relate to the Central Mining-Rand Mines group and show new high record profits for the East Rand Pro- prietary at Â£110,400 and for Modder- fontein East at Â£60,200. Following the practice adopted for the six pre- ceding months earnings have been based on a gold price of 148s per ounce. The metal has risen consider- ably in price since the end of August and even at the last quoted price on Friday was Â£8 per ounce. Neverthe- less, the group had sold most of its output at the price fixed in the returns. In any case, it has been debarred from participation in all but 2s of the rise per ounce owing to the Union Government's decision to appropriate all proceeds of sales of gold from the South African Mines realised at over 150s per ounce. There are no marked changes in the earnings reported for other mines, though there is an encou- raging increase in the case of City Deep, which put on Â£4,400 at Â£39,500 as compared with July.",

   "text_content" : "Considering that the chairman of Triplex Foundry gave a moderately hopeful view of the outlook as recently as last June, the decision to pass the i. erim dividend reflects the rapid deterioration of the political situation within the past few weeks. A year ago the company paid an interim of 2, per cent., which was followed by a final of 56 per cent., making 8 per cent. for the twelve months to March. The distribution was the same as in the preceding year, although available earnings had dropped to 8.7 per cent. from 19.1 per cent. in 1937-38. Net profit for the past year was Â£9,500, against Â£24,000 in the previous period. The 5s Ordinary shares were last dealt in at 3s 10d. While the decision may be based partly on motives of prudence, unfor- tunately justified by the state of emer- gency now existing, the type of busi- ness carried on by the company is one more suited to peace conditions than to a war economy. As manufacturer of the well-known \"Triplex \" grates and cooking ranges, including special pro- ducts in porcelain enamel, the com- pany must inevitably find its business contracting under conditions that dis- courage new building and household equipment.",

   "text_content" : "Despite the difficulties found last year in certain branches of commerce in New Zealand, the Standard Insurance Com- pany was able to achieve a further advance in earnings. The company undertakes- all classes of business ex- cept life. Fire, marine and accidernt premiums brought in Â£196,900, against Â£184,900, while interest on investments contributed a few hundreds more at Â£25,900. After allowing losses on a rather higher scale at Â£95,200, against Â£82,100, and reserve for unexpired risks, the net balance is Â£900 more at Â£44,900. The dividend is maintained at the rate of 12J per cent. on the Â£5 shares, Â£1 paid, for the third year in succession. Owing to the larger sum brought in the available balance is sufficient to allow the appropriation for depreciation of securities to be in- creased from Â£1,500 to Â£5,000, while Â£15,000 as before is added to reserve, leaving Â£22,300, or the same as before, to be carried forward.",

Non-Cumulative Participating shares from 5 per cent. to 3 per cent. The payment makes a total of 5 per cent. for the year to June, against 7 per cent, a year ago. This exceptional payment was due to an unusually good profit of Â£58,800, which was Â£12,000 better than in 1937, when the Participating Preference had 6 per cent. for the first time for six years. As a substantial manufacturer of sanitary ware, glazed bricks and tiles, drain pipes and fittings, faience and terra cotta goods, the company de- pends on conditions in the building trade for the main part of its business.

The decision prob- ably depends upon the wishes of the Treasury. The decision to recall members and staffs to their offices was reached by the Emergency Committee of the House during the course of an all-day session yesterday. RECALL BROADCAST Members and staffs- were notified of the recall by the following announce- ment during the 4.30 p.m. B.B.C. broad- cast: - The Committee has to-day passed regulations for the settlement of open bargains and for the resumption of busi- ness as from to-morrow [Tuesday].

That the Secretary's office and the offices of the other departments of the Stock Exchange shall remain open. TEMPORARY REGULATIONS 1. Periding the reopening of the House, the Committee have passed the following temporary regulations to come into imme- diate effect, and until repealed these temporary regulations shall govern the transaction of business and shall form part of the rules, regulations and usages of the Stock Exchange, and where in any case these temporary regulations differ from any of the existing rules, regulations and usages the temporary regulations shall have effect and prevail. 2. (i) Minimum prices for certain securities have been fixed, particulars of which are set out in the Stock Exchange Official Lists of 31st August, 1939, and during the currency of the temporary regulations no member or clerk shall do a bargain or negotiate a purchase or sale whether between members or non-mem- bers in any of these securities (or in any securities which may hereafter be added) at a less price than the minimum prices so fixed.

A broker before executing any order must fully satisfy himself that such order is not on behalf of or for the benefit of any enemy either directly or indirectly. 6. Any member found guilty of negli- gence in relation to any of these regulations will be brought under the disciplinary rules. Rule 97 concerns dealings in gilt- edged securities. LEAD FOR PROVINCES As is customary, Provincial Stock Exchanges are expected to follow the procedure adopted by London. Members had been advised to stay away from their offices on Friday last owing to the difficulty of reaching town due to the evacuation and they were not expected to make an appear- ance yesterday as the banks were closed. The Committee now feels that the time has arrived for members to re- turn to clear up routine matters left over last week and to be in a position to carry on business between offices. Most of those brokers' offices which were open on Friday weie again open yesterday. Normally yesterday would have been Contango Day and towards the close of last week brokers were preoccupied with the usual prelimi- naries incidental to the winding up of the Account. The decision to close the House on Friday brought much of that work to a standstill, but in some offices \"left over\" work necessitated the attendance yesterday of some of the principals and staff. Many of the large firms of dealers were absent from the City, as were many important firms of brokers. Where members attended, it was more with the object of dealing with clients' inquiries and other correspondence. So far as a representative of THE FINANCIAL TIMES could ascertain, no serious attempt was made to do busi- ness between offices. Shorter's Court, long the venue of the American market after official hours, was occupied by an important branch of the A.R.P. services.

In addition to Sir Ralph Wedgwood, the chairman, other members of the Committee have had experience of wartime railway control. Colonel Gilbert Szlumper, general manager of the Southern, was actually secretary to the Railway Executive Committee of the last war. That com- mittee was made up of twelve general managers and existed until Sir Eric Geddes's Railways Act of 1921. He was also Senior Railway Trans- port Officer throughout the war.

In this connection I have been wondering whether we shall ever re- turn to the traditional practice of the Bank of England in relation to the transfer of Inscribed stocks. The time-honoured method whereby a stockholder or his attorney had to attend in person at the Bank to effect a transfer is being replaced by the more modern system of formal deed. This has been necessitated by the removal of the Bank's transfer offices to Whitchurch, in Hampshire. The work of this department will now be done by post.

Sir Alfred Sherlock SLEARN that Sir Alfred Sherlock is making a good recovery from the recent serious operation to his upper jaw. Although he has thought it wise as a result of the operation to resign his chairmanship of British Guiana Con- solidated Goldfields, Sir Alfred has no intention of giving up his principal business interest as chairman and managing director of Booker Brothers McConnell and Co. Booker Bros. carries on an extensive business in Demerara, British Guiana. It owns sugar estates, wharves and stores and carries on a big business there as general merchants. Sir Alfred's connections with the country have extended over most of his lifetime. He started his business career in Demerara in his early twenties and stayed there to become one of the colony's leading citizens. He was a member of the Executive Council throughout the war and until 1926. Mr. J. Roland Robinson British Guiana Consolidated's new chairman is Mr. J. Roland Robinson, who has been a member of the Board for some. time. His only other direc- torial post is the chairmanship of the West End Board of Scottish Union and National Insurance. Mr. Robinson is the son of a Black- pool solicitor and is himself a bar- rister. He has represented Blackpool in Parliament since 1985 and has made a name for himself there as a champion of \"staggered\" holidays. He married a \"Woolworth heiress,\" the daughter of the late Mr. C. W. Gasque, who was a director and secre- tary of the American Woolworth Company. Observer",

   "text_content" : "Fuller details of the working of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, under which dealings in gold and foreign ex- change are prohibited rxcept through official channels, and the surrender for sale to the Treasury of private hold- ings of gold and certain foreign currencies by persons resident in the United Kingdom is made compulsory, were made available last night. A broad outline of the Government's plans was given in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday. The Bank of England has been authorised to deal in foreign exchange and has appointed certain banks as authorised dealers. These banks are divided into three categories, of which the first has power to deal in all foreign currencies, the second in currencies of certain colonies and dominions, and the third in a fixed list of currencies. THREE EXCEPTIONS The public should continue to trans act their foreign exchange busines through the agency of their own bankers, whether authorised dealers or not. Rates at which certain foreign currencies may be sold will be commu nicated to authorised dealers and published from time to time. Unti further notice exchange will be made available only to enable a contract made before the date on which the regula tions came into force to be complied with to meet reasonable requirements of a trade or business carried on in the United Kingdom and to defray reason able travelling or other persona expenses. The proviso concerning trade needs is intended to cover imports of goods; insurance treaties, premiums and claims; ships' disbursements freights; agents' commissions; royal ties; film rents; copyrights; salaries pensions, etc. So far as imports are concerned ex- change may be sold without furthei question: -Where goods had alread3 been imported before the date on which the regulations came into force; where the certified Exchange Control copy of a Customs entry form is produced foi goods imported after the date on which the regulations came into force, or where a declaration is made that the certified Exchange Control copy of a Customs entry form will be produced in respect of goods not yet imported. Credits and authorities entered into prior to the date on which the regula- tions came into force which are revoc- able will be revoked if their tenor is contrary to the terms of the regula- tions. CURRENCIES AFFECTED Private holders of gold and U.S. and Canadian dollars, belgas, Swiss and French france, guilders, Argentine pesos, Swedish crowns and Norwegian kroner are required to offer their hold- ings to the Government through their bank. They will be paid for in sterling at the prevailing rate. The Government needs the gold and exchange to help pay for what the coun- try must buy from abroad. Banks will help holders to make a statement of what the holding amounts to and will pay in cash as soon as the transfer to the Government has been completed. The foreign exchange to be offered for sale includes bank or currency notes, bank balances and any other means of payment, such as cheques, denominated in the currencies given above. PRE-WAR CONTRACTS Application may also be made for exchange to settle a pre-war contract or for exemption from surrendering any foreign exchange already acquired. Every facility will be given for the completion of genuine pre-war contracts.and contractual obligations of all sorts-except those which would result in a payment to enemy coun- tries. This does not mean that long- term commercial or other contracts can be carried out in every case. In the case of a contract to pay for goods which have not yet been shipped it may not be possible to obtain the foreign exchange unless an import license is obtained or the goods in question may be imported without license. Money may not be taken out of the country without official permission. This' includes bank notes, travellers' cheques, postal orders, gold, securities or foreign currency (for example, bank notes, promissory notes, cheques, drafts and other bills of exchange expressed in a currency other than sterling). All travellers on leaving the United Kingdom will be required :o declare any money (British or foreign) which they may be taking abroad, and to produce their authority. This applies to all currencies (except 3ritish silver and copper coin). The reasonable foreign exchange re- quirements of a trade or business car- ied on in the United Kingdom will be net so far as possible; but if for any other purpose it is required to send bank notes, postal orders, gold, securi- ies or any currency other than sterling sought. Forms have already been issued for use in applying to authorised dealers under the different classes of trans- actions envisaged. A declaration for gold will have to be made on form G, for exporting bank notes, gold, securi- ties or foreign exchange on form C, for foreign exchange on form E, for sterling transfers to foreign accounts on E.1, and in the case of travellers for exchange and permission to export bank notes, currency or gold on forms T or X. Twenty banks are authorised to deal in all foreign currencies. They are: - Bank of England Union Bank of Barclays Bank Manchester British Linen Bank Bank of Scotland Coutts and Co.

Outwardly, of course, the big banks appeared to be engaged in nothing more than the removal of documents and effects to \"other fields,\" as their doors were closed to the public, but behind those doors there were hives of activity. Not only had the several financial measures to be digested, but the executives and staffs were confronted with numerous forms relative to the emergency measures to be taken for the prosecution of the war. As was generally expected, control of foreign exchange transactions be- comes the order of the day. The Government needs gold and foreign exchange, the particular currencies listed being American and Canadian dollars, French and Swiss francs, Belgian belgas, Dutch guilders, Argentine pesos, Swedish kronor and Norwegian kroner. This list may be added to from time to time. Authorised Banks A list of banks authorised to deal in all currencies has been compiled, these institutions being ten of the 11 London clearing banks (the National Bank-which is an Irish bank-being omitted), the Scottish banks, and the Union Bank of Man- chester. Surprise was expressed at the inclusion of one or two institu- tions which have not hitherto had an exchange department. There are also lists of banks authorised to deal (a) in certain foreign currencies and (b) in cer- tain colonial and dominion currencies. A number of important banking institutions are omitted from these lists but they can continue to do busi- ness. Bankers other than authorised dealers who wish to maintain their normal relations with foreign corre- spondents should apply for permis- sion to the Bank of England. It should be emphasised that every effort will be made to enable contracts made before 3rd September to be complied with, the intention being to facilitate the completion of outstanding commercial and financial contracts. In some quarters yesterday concern was expresIed regarding fulfilment of forward contracts, but it is understood that every facility will be granted to liquidate these-even to the extent of \"swap'\" operations. Forward exchange transactions will be permitted for genuine commercial purposes. Brokers Displaced The war emergency regulations mean the displacement of foreign exchange brokers. Business during hostilities will be carried out by direct contact between the banks concerned. The wording of the regulations in certain parts created an impression that there may still be work for brokers to do as over the past few years. Un- fortunately, however, this is only a pious hope. Brokers will attend their offices to-day to see what happens when the \"market\" reopens under the new conditions, but, after that, it will be a case of dealings through banking con- tacts only. Speculation was rife yesterday as to what the rate for sterling will be. In ome quarters the view was expressed ;hat the existing level may be chosen, but, in other directions, it was felt that he authorities would raise the quota- ion in terms of the dollar because of he additional cost of imports with a lepreciated pound. It is thought that, whereas during :he Great War the pound was rigidly held at one level, the rate may be raried at intervals when the market has settled down under the new egime. It is interesting to note that Paris quoted 175.55 for sterling and 1.75 for dollars yesterday, thus &iving a dollar-sterling rate of around 4.25. This, of course, is no criterion .s to the view our authorities will ake. Incidentally, it was learned yester- lay that while the banks were closed o the public arrangements were made or meeting any demands for currency or internal purposes. No particular hange is expected in the discount narket owing to the unofficial assur- nces regarding Bank Rate and the utlet for bills in special quarters.",

   "text_content" : "The City is rapidly adjusting its business to the war-time conditions thrust upon the nation. The London Stock Exchange Committee has called upon members to reopen their offices to-day for the resumption of business. The House will remain closed until further notice. (See Page One Cols. Two and Three.) Regulations have been framed for the settlement of open bargains and for the carrying on of business pending the reopening of the House. As announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, the 7th September Settlement is postponed until 21st September. A new decision is that the settlement of all bargains done on Friday last in gilt-edged securities is postponed until 21st September or the first business day after the reopening of the House, whichever is the earlier. Contango rates for the extended periods based on altera- tions in the Bank Rate will be fixed by the Committee. MINIMUM PRICES RETAINED Minimum prices for gilt-edged securities set out in the Official List of 31st August are retained, but the question of their revision is under consideration. All stock and share bargains must be for cash. The Glasgow Stock Exchange will open to-day for business. The market has been closed since Friday, but the building has been open for use of members. It is not anticipated that much activity will be witnessed to-day. The Dublin Stock Exchange Committee met yesterday morning and decided, in view of the fact that Irish banks were closed, to suspend dealings until to-day. Provided the banks reopen to-day, the Stock Exchange will resume. Dealings will be in Irish securities only pending the resumption of business in London, and there will be no evening session.",

   "text_content" : "X&LL J_ 'J- V XjJ. Issuing houses yesterday expressed full agreement with and unconditioned acceptance of the new Treasury regu- lations concerning capital issues. Most of the issuing houses were open, and although few principals were in attendance reduced staffs were en- gaged upon routine work. Recent market conditions have been decidedly discouraging to new issue business, and therefore the outbreak of hostilities has found few firms with any considerable volume of business in hand. On the other hand, such new issues as were under consideration were largely con- cerned with the expansion of industries of national importance. It is expected that the Treasury may shortly be able to give consent for these plans to go ahead. NO OFFERS EXPECTED The Treasury has stated that \" Issues will be allowed . . . if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Treasury that they are advisable in the national interest.\" In any case, financial and market con- ditions make it unlikely that any new issues, apart from Treasury issues, will be made for some time to come. Although it is thought that the Treasury would give issuing houses permission to proceed in cases where they are already under con- tract to a third party, it is unlikely that the parties concerned would care to risk seeking capital from the public at the nresent time.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 4th Sept. The Governors of the New York Stock Exchange are to meet to-day to review the nature of selling and buying orders accumulated over the prolonged week-end and to consider the probable effect on the market. To-day's stock markets will be the first since war was declared on Germany.. They are expected to swing upwards, not only because of indications of increased indus- trial activity as shown by the business activity index for August, which was at a new current recovery high, but also because, as opposed to what happened in 1914, stps have already been taken to meet any emergency. Foreign holdings of U.S. stocks are smaller than in 1914 and Britain has already taken effective measures to pre- vent immediate liquidation. In addition, the War Industrial Board is already func- tioning, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act has removed any fear of a repetition of the disturbances experienced in 1914. Mr. Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury, who returned to-day from his Continental holiday, referred in an in- terview to the strong financial posi- tion. Gold had recently been imported at an average rate of about $72,000 millions (114,400,000), he said, and the gold re- serves of the Federal Reserve Banks were now $8,600 millions (Â£720,000,000) higher than in 1938, a record level. All United States and Canadian markets were closed yesterday for Labour Day. Saturday's closing prices appeared in \"The Financial Timnes \" yesterday.",

   "text_content" : "By C. B. ORMEROD On 31st August, the last day of trading on the London Stock Exchange prior to the outbreak of war, THE FINANCIAL TIMES Rail and Industrial indices closed at 41.6 and 96.6. The August lows were 40.7 and 92.4. The lowest points touched during the 1936-39 bear market have been 35.2 and 91.2. For a long time past this Dow Theory column has taken the view that the bear market is on its last legs. The price move- ment prior to the last fateful week-end in no way contradicted this premise. The Stock Market quickly adjusts itself to changed conditions. When it reopens, the market may well surprise the pessimists, as indeed has been the case in Wall Street which remained open over the week-end. At the August low levels both markets were, to all intents and purposes, discount- ing the outbreak of war. From now on their function will he to reflect the course of the struggle and to endeavour to fore- cast its outcome. One thing would seem certain and that is that British and American industry will from now on be working to capacity. Despite taxation and Governmental con- trol profits, as a whole, are wore likely to increase than decrease. The gradual development of a long-term uptrend in British equities may now occur, springing from the base created by the September, 1938, January and August, 1939, lows of 91.2, 91.4 and 92.4 respec- tively. A bullish attitude towards British equities will be justified so long as the 91.2 level remains intact. WALL ST. PRIMARY TREND In the case of Wall Street, the primary trend is assumed to have turned upwards in April. The sharp advance registered at the end of last week, to the accompani- ment of very heavy volume, bears out this assumption and confirms the viewpoint put forward in last week's article that the secondary reaction, which commenced in July, is over. The Dow-Jones averages may well con- tinue to fluctuate for the time being between the recent high and low levels which, in the case of the Industrial average, are 144.71 and 130.05 and for Rails. 80.20 and 25.85. The ultimate emer- gence from this zone will give a clear indi- cation of the long-term trend of American Common stocks and business activity under war-time conditions. Evidence at present available points to an upward penetration as being the more probable.",

   "text_content" : "\" FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL The London Metal Exchange will re- open at Whittington-avenue at noon to-morrow for the liquidation of open contracts; no new contracts will be permitted. A decision to this effect was arrived at yesterday by the Executive Committee which was ap- pointed recently by the Committee of the Exchange. Arrangements for subsequent busi- ness will be made on a day-to-day basis as circumstances require. It will be recalled that members cannot sell to consumers without a license. Negotiations are in progress, it is under- stood, for the fixation of maximum prices for lead, copper and spelter. A schedule of prices has been suggested by the Gov- ernment; these.prices are believed to be little higher than those current before the close of trading on the London Metal Ex- change last week. MATURING CONTRACTS As at present arranged, the business of the London Metal Exchange will be con- ducted in London; only if air-raid dangers are acute will the headquarters be moved to an address in the home counties. Some difficulty in dealing may result from the diversified location of the emer- gency offices taken in the country by ondon Metal Exchange firms. In the case of copper and tin, prompt contracts mature on specific days. But with lead and spelter, tendering is done by ship- ments, and in consequence the declarations may well have to be sent round numerous places in the country, with consequent delay.",

They will not in future accept for safe custody securities, parcels or boxes. Changes in banking hours through- out the country were announced by posters displayed outside bank pre- mises yesterday. The banks were closed for the day and will reopen to-day. For the time being bank offices will be open to the public on Mondays to Fridays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in- stead of from 9.30 to 3.30 p.m. On Saturdays and other normal half-days the hours will be 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. instead of 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. These hours will be subject to revi- sion to meet any change of circum- stances. The banks also point out that owing to the risk to transport and other difficulties unexpected delays may occur in the collec-' tion of cheques and other items. They are therefore unable to guarantee clear- ance within the normal period. PRECAUTION AGAINST LOSS In view of the possibility of risk of loss or destruction, customers are advised to keep a record of the following particulars: 1. Name of the bank and branch on which the cheques are drawn. 2. Name of drawer. 3. Amount of cheque and date of issue. In regard to articles left for safe custody, the banks state that while they will continue to hold securities, boxes and parcels within their available accommoda- tion as long as possible, they cannot under- take either to accept any further articles or to grant such storage indefinitely, or to move articles from one branch to another. Banks also reserve the right to move any securities or articles left for safe custody as they may consider desirable. While the banks will exercise all reason- able care with the facilities at their dis- posal to ensure the safety of articles de- posited with them for security or safe custody, they do not accept responsibility in the event of any damage or destruction. In the absence of banking facilities no business was done in the discount market. Some members of discount houses were at their offices in the morning, but generally left early in the afternoon. Business was also at a standstill in the foreign exchange market. Exchange transactions almost invariably originate with the foreign exchange department of banks and banking houses. The closing of the banks, therefore, left the market without any basis for its normal activities.",

The new arrangement is seen as a form of home rule under the egia of the Govern- ment and with the measure of home rule there is general satisfaction. This system of control has arisen naturally out of arrangements which had already been in existence and which required only to be modified. Sir Andrew Duncan, the Controller 'for the iron and steel industry whose appoint- ment was announced in sHE FINANCIAL TIMEs yesterday, is now responsible directly to the Minister of Supply. During the past two or three years the industry has had a certain amount of experience of questions relating to supply and to the granting of voluntary priorities-as opposed to compulsory priorities-which suppliers and merchants had to some extent exercised. Now practically everything has to be applied to a priority test. There are certain exemptions and, within the limits provided, other work will be dealt with in- cluding certain proportions of work in progress.

   "article_dc_title" : "Government War Risk Rates",
   "text_content" : "From our MAXINE INSURANCE CORRESPONDENT The Government's scale of rates for the insurance of cargoes against war risks was issued yesterday morning. As was stated in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, the Board of Trade has commenced such business from the new War Risks Insurance Office, Lloyd's Building, E.C. The Government Office's scale of rates is divided into two parts, the first rating ocean voyages which are numbered and the second rating short sea voyages to the Continent within stated limits and to the Irish Free State. THE SCHEDULE As the following list shows, the maxi- mum of the scale is 70s per cent. home- ward from America and also from the- Far East via the Cape and the minimum is 10s per cent, for voyages from the West Coast of the United Kingdom to the Irish Free State and vice versa.

Ship to warehousne and vice versa, as per explana. tory memorandum 10s per cent. Simultaneously the Joint War Risk Rating Committee of Lloyd's and Com- pany Underwriters issued a new general schedule of tates to apply to voyages which do not come within the Government's scale-that is, voyages other than those to, from or in the United Kingdom. These rates are naturally higher than the Gov- ernment's scale, reaching a maximum of 210 per cent, for voyages from the Con- tinent *ithin stated limits to the Mediter- ranean or Black Sea. POOL'S MACHINERY The new Government office is situated in the main entrance corridor of Lloyd's Building and market opinion is that the existing machinery of the \"Pool\" which collaborated with the Government over the now abandoned reinsurance scheme will be utilised for winding up Pool business and at theÃ½ same time to inaugurate and carry on the Government office. Clause 2 of tne war Risks Insurance Act, which is now in operation, empowers the Board of Trade to insure British ships and cargoes against \"war risks or King's Enemy Risks. Hence there is reason to believe that the limited reinsurance against King's Enemy Risks given by the Board of Trade to the Pool will now be expanded under the Government office, which will become a direct insurer of cargoes against all war risks. STATE'S COVER 80% As for the insurance of ships, the Government has not as yet announced that it is providing direct insurance against war risks, ahd so it must be assumed that the arrangement hitherto in force con- tinues. This is that the Government re- insures the mutual associations formed by shipowners to cover war risks on a com- munal basis, to the extent of 80 per cent. of their liability, subject to certain pro- visions as to the amount insured, etc. Clause 2 of the Act only provides that the Government becomes a direct insurer of ships against war risks if it appears to the Board of Trade that reasonable and adequate facilities for such insurance are not available. It is patent that, as yet, this situation has not arisen, nor is it likely to on the precedent of the Great War when a similar arrangement to that now in operation worked very well indeed.",

   "text_content" : "The British coal industry, which has not been placed under Government c6ntrol like iron and steel, although the possi- bility of such a step cannot be ruled out, is capable of a considerable increase in output. Although production has been running high in recent months there is no doubt that it could be raised very substantially should the need arise. The full potential output of the mines, as at present equipped, is very much greater than is likely to be required for some time since industrial consumers have large stocks. Already, under legislation passed during the last decade, the State exercises a wide measure of control over the mining industry. The Central Council of Colliery Owners is a statutorily constituted body and is in a position to take such steps as may be -necessary in the national interest. Rationing of coal and its products has already been announced and the necessary machinery was established e'qarly in the summer,",

   "text_content" : "The steady fall which has occurred since February in the number of unemployed continued last month. On 14th August the workless total was 1,231,692, a reduction of 24,732 com- pared with 10th July. The total was made up of 968,108 wholly unemployed, 211,978 tem- porarily stopped and 51,606 normally in casual employment. Ministry of Labour figures published last evening show that on 14th August the number of insured persons in employment n i l [a rtaiLn was alpproximately 12.900,000. This was 12,000 less than the record total at 10th July, but 610,000 more than the total for the corresponding month last year. The tigure for 14th August excludes in- suredl militiamen and reservists numbering approximately 50,000, who were in train- ing at that date. MINES EMPLOY MORE There was an improvement in employ- ment in coal mining, engineering, ship- building and repairing, building and public works contracting, the cotton industry, shipping services, the distributive trades and hotel and boarding house service. On the other hand, employment declined in pottery and footwear manufacture-mainly necause of local holidays-and in dress- making. The total of workless comprised 908,752 men, 38,347 boys, 245,209 women and 39,384 girls. It included 1,102,416 persons who were applying for benefit or unem- ployment allowances. Of these, 245,000, or 22 per cent., had been out of work for 12 months or more; 741,000, or 67 per cent., for less than 6 months; 643,000. or 58 per cent., for less than 3 months; and 525,000, or 48 per cent., for less than 6 weeks. Of those on the registers about 53 per cent. were applicants for insurance benefit and about 37 per cent. for unemployment allowances, while about 10 per cent. had no applications for benefit or unemploy- ment allowances.
