   "text_content" : "SILVER LOWER Bank Rate 4 per cent., 24th August, 1939 Deposit Rates Tender Rates Bankers ......... 2 p0 3 months T.B.- Brokers 2 pc (\"call\") *Â£3 12 0.98 pc ,, 21 pc (\"notice\") *Average for Â£50,000,000 allotted 8th Sept. THURSDAY Evening. Principal interest in the Money market to-day centred in the Bank Rate decision, which, as most competent observers anticipated, was left un- changed at 4 per cent. This made little material difference to discount rates themselves, but it did nothing to encourage business. Most houses preferred to hold on to their bills in the belief that a lower Bank Rate will not be long delayed. Conse- quently, the banks were not very success- ful in restocking their bill portfolios, despite the fact that their rates were 3 per cent. for October, 3% per cent. for Novem- ber and 3% per cent. for December dates. In outside quarters a demand for the \" hot\" Treasury bill was reported at 3 per cent. Leading houses quoted 3%-3% per cent. as their buying rate for three months bank drafts. Short loans were in ample supply, the Bank Return showing bankers' deposits at the high level of Â£109.6 millions despite an expansion of Â£3.6 millions in the active note circulation to the new high level of Â£553.5 millions. Many borrowers satisfied their requirements at 2% per cent. in outside quarters. __ LoANS DISC.LuM I R CENT. PER CENT.

Following yesterday's sharp ad- vance, silver prices turned downwards as a result of speculative profit-taking, but business was small. Cash was 6ad off at 21%d and forward delivery Yd lower at 21%d per ounce. New York Rate Change The most interesting development in the foreign exchanges was the first adjustment in the London-New York rate of exchange since the introduction of currency control. The official rate was $4.02 to $4.04, as com- pared with $4.02 to $4.06 previously. In some quarters this lowering of the buying side was attributed to the fall in sterling in New York, but others interpreted it as a desire by the authorities to narrow the spread. Canadian dollars were also slightly dearer at $4.40. Among the Continentals, Norwegian kroner appreciated a further 10 points to 17.64%, Swedish kronor 7%Y points to 16.80 and Dutch guilders 2 cents to 7.58%. Swiss francs were a trifle weaker at 17.75.

   "text_content" : "From OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK, 14th Sept. The Stock Market turned quieter as operators endeavoured to appraise the expected war benefits, and the tendency throughout was indecisive. Net price changes generally were small and irregu- lar following a turnover of 2,010,000 shares-1,750,000 fewer than yesterday. Part of to-day's selling was based on the belief that th'- market will go to lower levels prior to the resumption of any important advance. The opening was active and irregular, but trading turned slower during the morning. With the break in sterling and pressure against Steel shares, stocks sold off anything to 2 points. Still, support for the market quickly reappeared, and, while some easy spots persisted, numerous issues wete fractions to $1 higher at mid- day. This recovery was not sustained in the early afternoon. Steels turned irregular, and Coppers and Chemicals were easy. The week's figures of railroad freight loadings were about as expected and Rails kept steady, but Air- crafts and Motors were undecided. Mer- chandisings again moved higher. Mr. Morgenthau's remarks that the Treasury had no plans for recommending special taxes at the Congress special session were viewed as encouraging in the later opera- tions, but business continued quiet until the end and the close was irregular. The Dow-Jones Industrials closing average further declined 0.39 to 153.71 and Rails 0.17 to 32.40, but Utilities were slightly firmer by 0.01 at 24.31. Dealings comprised 927 stocks, of which 397 im- proved, 348 receded and 182 were un- changed. In the Bond market U.S. Governments and Railroads kept steady; bond sales dwindled to $10,330,000 Moody's commodity index (31st Decem- ber, 1931=100) was 169.9, against 167.9 yesterday. The Commodity Exchange has voted that there will be no limits on daily fluctuations during the spot month of any commodity, with effect after ten days. Commodities traded on the Exchange are rubber, silk, metals and hides. Electricity production for the week to 9th September totalled 2,290,000,000 kw.h.. an increase of 11.8 per cent. over the like week of last year. The Maritime Commission has awarded to Bethlehem Steel a contract for five cargo vessels costing $1,909,000 each. Heavy construction awards in August amounted to $311,222,000, compared with $181,469,000 in July and $231,771,000 in August, 1938. Total for the first eight months of 1939 is $2,049,915,000, a rise of 16.3 per cent. on last year. World production of lead in July totalled 153,200 tons, compared with 150,600 in June. U.S. production was 34,900 tons, against 37,200. World production of slab zinc in July totalled 154,700 tons, compared with 147,600 in June. The July earnings of 140 railroads reporting to the Interstate Conlmerce Commission show:-Operating revenue, $334,000,000 (inc.. $34,360,000 on a year ago); operating income, $49,010,000 (inc. $10,580,000). Following a conference with President Roosevelt, Mr. Herbert Bayard Swope, the well-known publicist, predicted the repeal of the arms shipment embargo provisions of the Neutrality Act.

   "text_content" : "Very irregular conditions prevailed on the Stock Exchange yesterday. There was some further forced selling during the morning in connection with positions where contango facilities had been refused the previous day. The overnight halt on Wall Street dimin- ished and subdued local dealings in Yankees. An attack of jitters regard- ing Russian intentions appeared to be passing off by the close of the session. Leading British Industrials, notably Woolworths and Imperial Tobacco, attracted bargain hunters and rallied from their recent weakness. Sterling Peg Lowered It was something of a surprise yester- day morning when the Bank of England lowered the dollar exchange rate to 4.02- 4.04. True, this is only a trifle below the 4.02-4.06 which was the first official rate to be fixed after the outbreak of war, and had remained unaltered since 5th September. None the less, this slight concession will be regarded by the prophets of inflation as a sign of more to come. After easing a cent or so a day the New York cable transfer rate for ster- ling dropped late yesterday to 3.94. It was being asked whether the move foreshadows a further decline in the London value of sterling this morn- ing If so it is presumed-though it cannot be regarded as a certainty- that the Bank of England's price for gold would be raised proportionately from its current record quotation of eight guineas per ounce. Gold Policy Admittedly the Exchange Fund has the resources to maintain sterling around its present rate for a very long period. But whether it will be thought good policy to permit the pound to get out of touch with fluctuations on the other side of the Atlantic has yet to be seen. Mr. Morgenthau re-empha- sised on Tuesday that the United States would continue to buy gold without limit at $35 per ounce. Any quantity shipped from this side would clearly help to support sterling. If sterling is allowed to depreciate much under $4 then it is argued by a banker of my acquaintance-as well as by naturally less impartial market men -that gold ought to be allowed to cross Â£9 an ounce in order further to stimu- late Empire production and augment the reserves of the Exchange Fund. It is thought, tat South Africa.and Southern Rhodesia might then be in- duced to raise the maximum price of Â£7 10s per ounce which they recently decided was the limit their gold mines would be allowed to retain. Should there be a gradual inflationary rise in metals and other commodities, then working costs will obviously tend to increase. If the mines were then too severely restricted as regards their selling prices a proportion of low-grade ore would obviously become unprofitable to work. bTh Diarist"

   "text_content" : "THURSDAY Evening. Although some Stock Exchange members reported a slight. improve- ment in business to-day, turnover in general showed no expansion. Yesterday's tendency to dulness was accentuated by doubt as to Russia's attitude towards Poland and by absence of demand for gilt-edged securities at the minimum prices fixed last month. Necessitous sellers of British Government stocks were stated to be finding realisations impracticable at the minima owing to the lack of buyers at these levels, and to have been turning out any Industrial and other securities for which a market can be found. The deadlock created by the gilt-edged minima is thus tending to spread depres- sion to other sections. Total bargains recorded in all markets were 2,647, against 2,549 yesterday. In the absence of the hoped-for reduc- tion in Bank Rate, conditions in the gilt- edged market became still more difficult. Prices remained at the fixed minima and dealings ranged from these figures to about % higher, although \" Old \" Consols marked up to 62% against a fixed price of 62. Conversion 4% per cent. was relatively active, changing hands from the minimum of 100% up to 101. The volume of transactions in Corpora- tion and Dominion issues was a little larger on the basis of the minimum prices. EUROPEAN BONDS DROOP The closure of the majority of open bear accounts in Europeans left a reduced volume of business to be transacted in the Foreign bond market to-day. Where movements were recorded they showed, in most cases, substantial marking down of the bonds of belligerent countries. Thus Polish (1927) 4% per cent. left off 6 points lower at 32. German 5 per cent. and 4% per cent. again shed half a point each to close at 8 and 5% respectively. The interest in' Chilean and Argentine bonds which has lately provided the firmest feature of the market was con- siderably reduced. Chilean 6 per cent. were up to 15 at one time during the morn- ing, but later relapsed to their overnight level of 14%. Foreign Bond Prices Page 4 HOME RAILS ON OFFER In the Home Rail market dealing in prior charges under the minimum price regulations continue to be difficult. On balance there is a tendency to sell stock and jobbers are finding it difficult to find buyers. Deals are therefore a matter of negotiation in every case. The Official List showed.-.few. markings yesterday. Among Ordinary stocks there was less selling pressure than has been the recent experience of the market and Southern 5 per cent. Preferred Ordinary showed the only loss of the day at 49. While buying of Argentine Rails con- tinued in some directions a few stocks evidenced weakness due to profit-taking. B.A.G.S., the line most concerned in the moving of the wheat crop, were again in demand and the 5 per cent. Preference gained a further point to 26. On the other hand, Central Argentine were sold and shed % to 8%, while B.A. Western sus- fered a similar setback to 7. Elsewhere in the Foreign list Canpacs were easier following the drop on Wall Street overnight and closed % off at 6. Selling of Nord 6 per cent. Sterling bonds abated and the price remained at 85. New York Central were again the only American Rail to attract attention. The quotation was marked down half a point to 22% in sympathy with the reaction in New York. Home and Foreign Rail Prices Page 4 INDUSTRIALS HEAVY Fresh Selling Depresses Bank and Brewery Groups Industrial shares found no relief from the heaviness of spirit imparted by the gloomy forebodings concerning the im- pending war taxation and scattered selling again was encountered. In the circum- stances the general trend continued down- ward, no resistance being offered owing to the lack of public interest. This was attri- buted in a way to the lack of pointers calculated tp attract new business. What demand arose was moderate and restricted to a few specialities. While the selling of BANKING shares was not heavy some of it had the appearance of being forced, probably on account of holders in urgent need of funds. Business was done in Barclays \" B \" down to 53s 6d, the final quotation of 56s showing a new loss of 6s 6d. INSURANCE shares lacked attention and in a few instances were lower. Prudential \"A\" were 2% lower at 25 and Commercial Union % easier at 7%. The recent marking down of ELECTRIC SUPPLY securities brought forward prac- tically no inquiries for stock. A few sellers were still about and Northmets were 2s lower at 35s, while London Electrics were is 9d down at 28s 9d. ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENTS were neglected. Ever Readys turned dull. Automati Tele- phones declined Is and G.E.C. were 9d easier. While Fords rallied to 15s, the trend of MOTORS where changed was adverse. A tins were weak with the \"A\" dealt in at 19s. . Changes were few among AIRCRAFT issues. Bristols on some support rose 6d to 15s; on the other hand, Hawker Sidde- leys were realised down to 11s 3d and left off at 11s 9d with a loss of 9d. News of the plan to form a Ministry of Shipping induced some profit-taking among SHIPPING shares. The tendency became reactionary and France Fenwick were 9d lower at 23s 9d. Elder Dempster Holdings eased 6d. Furness Withy changed UOUwlI U rOb UU MIIU UII&LU5 LU Io UU. * and 0. Deferred marked down to 22s. IRON and STEEL shares were inactive. Stantons on some inquiry strengthened to 50s; otherwise prices were easier where changed. Stewarts and Lloyds fell 9d to 41s 3d and Richardson Westgarths 6d to 4s. Indian Irons reacted 2s 6d to 52s 6d. In COAL, William Corys receded Is 9d to 84s 6d. Imperial' Sneltings continued in request and changed up to lls 9d. Chinese En- gineerings were up 6d to 17s. Imperial Chemicals remained dull around 29s Od and Murex changed at 76s 3d. Lautaro Nitrates were favoured up to 4s 4dd. United Molasses closed at 26s rather buyers. Profit-taking caused irregular move- ments in TEXTILES. J. and P. Coats were sold and closed Is down at 27s 6d. Patons and Baldwins and a few low-priced issues were easier, but Fine Spinners Preference improved to 9s 6d and Calico Printers Pre- ,, â , A , _ , . / . Â·i Â·I ference jumped 7%d to 7s 4%d. Apart from Courtaulds, which were 9d down at 27s 3d, after changing at 28s 3d in the early dealings, RAYONS were seldom men- tioned. Some recovery was shown by CHAIN STORE issues, which closed firmer all round. Woolworths were e%. betterat 21X and Marks and Spencer \" A \" Vs up at 2%. Great Universals changed at 24s. It became difficult again to sell BREWERY shares, except at poor prices. Taylor Walkers were a weak spot with a loss of 3s to 21s. Bass were 7s 6d lower at 97s 6d and Ansells fell 6s to 62s. City of London Brewery Deferred were lowered 9d to 5s 9d. Distillers were 5s down at 85s, but had a firmer appearance at the end. ToBAccos remained unsettled by taxation fears, but changes were small. British- American rallied %'/ to 4. Imperials at 5%. (after 5%) and Imperial of Canada at 3% were each '/ easier. Among FOODSTUFF issues, International Stores were firmer at lls 9d, but United Dairies weakened anew to 48s 9d and Aerated Breads 9d to 14s d. Tte andpart Lylefrom Courtaulds, which were 9d down at 6s and Ste. Madeleines 6dg at 28s to s. American Industrials were quieter and prices generally were a little easier. Industrial Share Prices Page 4 TRINIDAD OILS BOUGHT In a moderately busy OIL market the lead was taken by some of the Trinidad STORE issues, several of which continued firmer all round. Woolworths were `%e better-at 2%As recent upward movement. The\" A \" advance in Royal Dutch, which has been one of the features of the week, was checked by a4s. little offering from Amsterdam which causIt became difficult again to 41.

   "text_content" : "Stock Exchange business wheels are beginning slowly to revolve. With many a creak, many a stop, the machinery of dealing in stocks and shares begins to get under way after the stoppage caused by the spoke which Hitler thrust into the peace of Europe. In some of the markets of yesterday there was more doing than we had seen this week. Argelitine Railway stocks are showing signs of life. Stocks and shares in companies connected with sugar are being inquired for. The Oil market is in favour. It becomes a little more possible to deal in War Loan and other gilt-edged securities: a buying order may help in the execution of several selling orders that had been left at the minimum prices. Still largely a matter of negotiation, business is, nevertheless, more flexible than it was. Jobbers are making prices again; not in everything, of course, but in a fairly large number of cases. London Power Generously covered as to interest and capital, subject to a good annual sinking-fund, and with the reputation behind it of being a first-rate security, London Power Five per Cent. debenture looks cheap at 98. The price went ex interest three weeks ago. A few thousand pounds can be bought in the Stock Exchange market. The stock is not in the trustee list, but it is an excellent investment for all that. Murex The final Murex dividend for the year ended 30th June last is due for declaration in about a week. The in- terim of 71 per cent. is expected to be followed by a final 121, to make 20 per cent. for the year. Shares are purchasable to a modest extent at 77s 6d. The company's last balance-sheet showed remarkable strength. Murex shares make a sound investment at to-day's price. Kaffir Considerations Technical difficulties which have arisen in the Kaffir market and, to a lesser extent,, elsewhere, have played their part this week in laying an addi- tional restraint upon business in the shares more particularly affected. In these latter are included certain of the non-producing South African mines. Prices have fallen, it may be unduly, owing to the pressure of sales in a market that lacks willing buyers. - As -soon as the-present-Aecount-is out of the way we shall be told that the mid-October Settlement is also likely to prove a stiffish hedge. But there has been plenty of time to deal with difficulties as these arose. The more talk 'there is in advance of possible trouble, the less likelihood is there of trouble materialising. In Quest of Cash These considerations, it may be added, will help to explain why shares in other markets should have given way for what appears to be no genuine reason. Where money has to be provided against unexpected losses in one department the differences may have to be raised by sales of shares elsewhere. With markets as tender and as nar- row as they are to-day, any slight pressure to sell exercises an influence wholly disproportionate to the amount of stock dealt in. Herein lies one possible explanation for the drop in Distillers. Autaolrus",

   "text_content" : "When Bank Rate was doubled to Four per Cent. on 24th August, after more than seven years' immobility, the movement attracted some criticism. THE FINANCIAL TIMES expressed the view that a basic motive for the move- ment was the desire to sound a call to caution in finance. That need re- mains insistent, but with strict con- trol imposed in numerous respects, the authorities have no necessity to rely upon Bank Rate to assist in the attain- ment of the objective. There would be little danger, therefore, of a reduction being an incitement to unwholesome expansion or speculation-such irrup- tions are already forestalled by con- trols. Of course, Four per Cent. can scarcely be called a crisis level even in a cheap money era, and it compares with a range of Five to Six per Cent. operative throughout practically the whole of the war of 1914-18. At the same time, it is easier to find reasons for lowering it than for keeping it at its present level. If the advance to Four per Cent. was a signal for caution, a drop, say, to Three per Cent. would be fitly con- strued as a gesture of strength. It will not be gainsaid that Britain is strong financially as well as otherwise, alike in the home and the external sphere. This week's Bank Return reveals no further marked expansion, notwith- standing the magnitude of the changes wrought in our social life by evacua tion and other upheavals. Bankers' Deposits of over Â£150,000,000 testify to earlier expansion but also to liquidity, while the proportion of the Reserve to liabilities is still as high as 16.7 per cent. This figure in itself satisfactory is pro tected against the effects of any flight of capital by the official control of the exchanges, while conversely Hank Rate is powerless to strengthen either the reserve or sterling exchange: Official action is tending to make Hank Rate ineffective, and recognition of this fact, leading to expectations of an early reduction, is helping to put the rate still further out of touch with realities. The result is the creation of an artificial position, which not only is holding bill business in check, but is having adverse reactions upon the Stock Markets. There is force in the argument that the existing minimum prices for gilt-edged stocks are incom patible with a Four per Cent. Bank Rate. Yields on gilt-edged issues, moreover, are the keystone of the whole structure of investment returns, while their importance in relation to the Government. borrowing which is in prospect needs no emphasis. If, as is thought, a lower Bank Rate would be conducive to greater demand and higher prices for Government stocks, that is one more strong argument in favour of a change. It may be thought desirable to avoid precipitate action and to allow a little more time for markets to settle down, but where it is practic- able to dissipate any of the present atmosphere of artificiality, this should be done as quickly as possible. *",

The lines are under Government control, but until it is known what the financial arrange- ments will be it is impossible to take a view. The large movements of popu- lation from evacuated areas and the dis persion of the administrative side of industry and commerce to urban and rural districts have made big changes in normal passenger traffic. This is recognised in the revised services, which have also been designed to facili- tate the large movements of passengers and materials for emergency and protective purposes. Whatever plan may be adopted to reimburse the railways for the essential services they are providing on the home front, it is hardly likely to have any relation to the exceptional traffic condi- tions of the moment. Pursuit of wages claims by the railwaymen is another factor still further obscuring the posi- tion as viewed by stockholders. All three trade unions put forward their claims totalling over Â£2,300,000 before the Railway Staff National Council a fortnight ago, and as no agreement was reached they have been referred to the Tribunal. The hearing will be held next Tuesday.",

   "text_content" : "Progressively unfavourable results have attended the course of the British Sugar Corporation since its formation in 1936. Abnormally adverse weather conditions last year were responsible for one of the worst beet crops -on record and upset all calculations. The outcome was particularly unfdrtunate for the corporation, as the Government subsidy is based on a forecast and not on the actual crop. The effect is seen in the drop of trading profit from Â£672,600 to Â£383,300, and a loss of Â£13,800 against a profit of Â£171,600, after making all provisions. In con- sultation with the Government it has been decided to withdraw Â£130,000 from dividend equalisation reserve, which enables a dividend of 4 per cent. against 44 per cent. to be paid, and Â£61,200 against Â£81,600 to be carried forward. Justification for the draft on reserve is found in the arrangement made with the Government for additional assistance during the current year, equal to the sum withdrawn, and the better outlook gives grounds for hope that the whole sum can be replaced next year. The standard quantity in respect of which the corporation* can claim .the subsidy is 560,000 tons of white sugar, but an expansion, of output is not unlikely in view of the desirability of increasing home food supplies. The balance-sheet shows :Â· li *:i , i stocks and stores at the rather lower figure of Â£1,877,000, against Â£2,128,200 a year ago.",

   "text_content" : "\"FINANCIAL TIMES\" SPECIAL During exchange control the princi pal currencies in which our authori- ties are most interested have moved, in many cases, substantially. Yester- day one of the most interesting changes was of two cents in the official buying rate for American dollars. This is the first alteration in the sterling-dollar exchange since \"war\" conditions prevailed and the new regulations came into force. Divergent Views Market opinion was divided on the question why the alteration was made. In places, it was argued that the authorities merely wished to narrow the spread between the buying and selling rate and that the move was not a reflection of the business done on the previous day. It was averred that the selling side is the fixed side rather than the buying side. There was talk of a possible narrowing of the margin to one cent. Other market authorities asserted that the \"control\" had been adjusting the various quotations in accordance with those ruling elsewhere. They con- tended that yesterday's change in the dollar was, in part at least, a reflection of the overnight level in New York and that it was a move to bring more dollars out. During business hours yesterday it was learned that sterling in New York was well below $4 to the Â£. Owing to the regulations in London, it is inevitable that a black market in sterling should spring up abroad; even friendly foreign institu- tions are fretting at the delays and ever-changing decisions given on cur rency problems here. More Notes Contrary to some expectations the weekly Bank of England statement did lot show a reflux of currency notes. There was a further outflow of some Z3% millions last week to the new record of Â£553 millions odd. This makes an expansion of over Â£45,000,000 in three weeks, or nearly 9 per cent., which is not out of the way. Evacuations are still going on and so is the movement of troops. Furthermore, there is an unusually large volume of cash transactions in- stead of drawing of cheques on bank leposits. There is no question of note hoard- ing-the carrying of larger cash balances is temporary. The situation in Germany is different, for there exists note hoarding and a flight from the currency into goods of intrinsic worth.",

The full report now issued shows that the tonnage milled was rather more than in the preceding year, but that the yield per ton milled declined further, from 3.776 dwts to 3.489 dwts. The total ore reserve, including un- available ore, at the end of the year was estimated at 7,324,800 tons, a de- crease of 671,800 tons, the value and width both being slightly smaller than twelve months earlier. At 21s 3d the 10s shares yield 23J per cent. This high figure is, of course, ex- plained by the fact that the distribu- tions are now partly in the nature of a return of capital. During its long life New Modder has paid out more than Â£33 millions in dividends, and its existence may be prolonged by the latest rise in the price of gold.",

Earnings for the 10s Ordi- nary shares have risen from 10 to 11.8 per cent., and would therefore have permitted a restoration of the dividend to the 10 per cent. paid for 1936-37. Instead, the directors are taking the conservative course of repeating the distribution at 9 per cent. The shares, which are an inactive market and are nominally quoted at 14s, therefore yield rather less than 6i per cent. The company is a holding concern, owning the entire share capital of three firms, and it may well be that the results of the subsidiaries show a greater improvement than those of the parent company.

Never- theless, the effects of the earlier ex- perience have not been entirely effaced, trading profits having fallen from Â£38,400 to Â£21,800. There is no charge for bank interest this time, the company being well supplied with cash, and provisions for displaced plant, special repairs and A.R.P. ex- penditure are less than last year. As a result, net profit is no more than Â£11,500 down at Â£20,800, before tax and depreciation. Depreciation is again charged at Â£4,000, but taxation takes Â£4,300 in- stead of Â£2,500. The reduction in the dividend from 15 to 124 per cent. is due to considerations of policy rather than to the fall in earnings, for the surplus over the payment slightly ex- ceeds Â£5,000.

It would then be advisable to re- duce your holding. as difficulties of obtain- ing finance and machinery must lie ahead of concerns of this type. Angus-Better do nothing until Supplemen. tary Budget is introduced. Then await its effect upon security values. Anxious, Blackpool--We would hold Libanon for the time being. The company raised sufficient money by a new issue in July to enable the development stage to be reached, when a decision can be made as to the erec- tion of a treatment plant. This is unlikely to be before the end of next year. We would sell the others at the first favourable opportunity. Elizabeth-So far as can be judged, all these concerns are likely to maintain their divi- dends, though in order to conserve the cash resources reductions in some cases must be expected. As regards Nickels, you will re- ceive any dividends declared. You must register these shares at Bank of England. Gale-The line serves a populous State, and New York speculators should have first- hand knowledge of its possibilities. It is only natural they should take a speculative interest in it. The question of dividends is not always a factor. On this side many non-dividend paying shares are popular gambling counters. Would keep shares for present. Ken-Reports for years 1937 and 1938 gave no details of the holdings, but indicated that 42 per cent. of total was in Ordinary shares. Report estimated break-up value of Hydro-Electric Common at end 1938 to be $4.8 a share. In absence of essential de- tails we cannot estimate present-day value. May-Quite impracticable to prepare list of good Industrial companies \" likely to main- tain profits and dividends.\" We cannot forecast what fresh burdens will be imposed upon industry and possible restrictions if war is prolonged. Puzzled-1. Shipping shares are among the few Industrials in really good demand. It should be to your advantage to retain Elder Dempster Holdings. 2. For the present it is not desirable to interfere with the in- vestments in building societies. T. R. B.-Prudent course would be to retain until Stock Exchange business is on a broader basis. To realise now would mean accepting poor prices for each of the shares named-an unnecessary sacrifice merely to exchange into some other share. These are just as hopeful as anything in these days. T. T-B.-1. As a general rule we would not be in a hurry to sell Kaffirs, but much depends on which shares you hold. We would suggest Mysore among Indians. 2. Purchases of these shares would be a reasonable risk. 3. None just now; we think that tendency of that group will be lower after the Budget. 4. It might be to your advantage to retain these at present. We cannot forecast whether your prices will be reached.",

   "text_content" : "In the absence of any lowering of Bank Rate yesterday, Stock Exchange business in British Government securities became even more difficult. Had Bank Rate been reduced, it is believed, there would have been a market at and just above the minima fixed last month. As it was, the gilt-edged descriptions were practically unsaleable. An unfortunate repercussion of this development is that other markets are being affected. Small holders, unable to dis- pose of their gilt-edged stocks, are now selling Industrials and other issues in order to provide liquid resources. The market feels that a lowering of Bank Rate would relieve the position. In the meantime one suggestion put forward in the market for relieving the difficulties of investors is that the Government should purchase amounts of, say, Â£50,000 of gilt-edged issues daily. Such purchases would be held avail- able for meeting necessary sales by small investors who are at present un- able to sell at the ruling minimum rates. Banks or brokers would guarantee that the sales were necessi- tous ones. \"SELLING 'INQUIRY Value Exaggerated Very large figures are being men- tioned as the total amount of un- satisfied sales. But these figures are probably exaggerated appreciably, be- cause a broker in endeavouring to sell stock approaches several jobbers. In this way, the volume of the selling in- quiry has probably been multiplied. The market takes the view that if the Government were to purchase about Â£50,000 of stock each day for a week or so this would relieve pressure by letting out the small investors. Tin issues were again a feature of the Mining markets on the increase in the quota to 80 per cent, and a belief that the Buffer Pool maximum price will be raised above the present level of Â£230. There was not a great volume of trading as the number of shares on offer was small. Profit-taking took place in coppers and quotations declined. Oils continued to attract a certain am'ount of attention, interest being parti- cularly directed to a few Trinidad issues. Industrials were still heavy undersome forced selling and the threat of impending taxation. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1",

The Home Office announces that cinemas will be opened to-day from 10 A.m. until 10 p.m. everywhere except in the West End of London where opening-time will be 10 a.m. till 6 p.m. Opening hours in the West End will be discussed later in the light of experience. This also applies to theatres and other nlaces of public entertainment. This decision was made known following a visit to the Home Office yesterday of film trade leaders representing cinema interests in the West End. Mr. W. R. Fuller, secretary of the Cine- matograph Exhibitors' Association, stated afterwards that there was a good deal of discussion upon the definition of the West End for the purposes of the new regula- tion. Newsreel cinemas, since they were of limited capacity, had a special case, and they would be a subject for further discussion.",

To-day had originally been fixed as the time limit. The change has been necessitated by the outbreak of war, which, it is understood, has been followed by an almost complete cessation of applications, as potential dealers are unable to make plans ahead. At the end of six months it is probable that the position will again be reviewed by the Government. It should then be possible to determine whether any modifi- cation of the licensing proposals may be required.",

The selling rate was maintained at $4.02, but the buying rate was lowered from $4.06 to $4.04. The middle was, therefore, $4.03, as against $4.04 hitherto. Opinion differed as to whether this was merely an effort to narrow the spread or whether it reflected the weaker tendency shown by sterling in New York overnight. It is noteworthy that the rate in New York fell well below $4 to the Â£ late yesterday. Money Market Notes Page 2 Col. 2",

   "text_content" : "Prospects for the British plastic mould- ing industry have improved -considerably as a result of the outbreak of war.. For some time this comparatively new industry has been suffering from reduced orders and there has consequently been intense competition and price-cutting. More stability is now promised as the demand for plastics is likely to increase considerably. In the three fighting ser- vices alone the uses of plastic mouldings exceed '1,000 in number. Civil uses are constantly increasing. Improved conditions within the industry have lessened the dangers of price-cutting. The British Plastics Federation, the mem- bership of which comprises manufacturers responsible for about 75 per cent. of the country's turnover in plastics, is watching the position. Up to the present, the Federation has urged its members to refrain from price-cutting, but has not formulated any co-operative scheme."

This makes a total expansion in three weeks,of Â£45.4 millions, or just under 9 per cent. The growth is due to the large volume of transaclions being conducted on a cash basis instead of by cheques. There are no such sensational move- ments in the current statement as there were in its immediate predecessor. A minor feature is the increase of Â£24,444 in the holding of gold coin and bullion, '\" 1: 4'r'ice of gold was again taken at 168s per fine ounce.

LOWER CREDIT BASE The note efflux depleted the Banking Department reserve by Â£3.6 millions to Â£27,186,557, but as total deposit liabilities were Â£5,000,000 lower, the ratio is only 1.7 per cent. down at 16.7 per cent. Not only was no attempt made to counteract the contractionary effect of the note efflux but Government and other securities were depleted by nearly Â£2,000,000, so that the actual credit base was reduced by just over Â£5,000,000. As public deposits declined by just over Â£3,000,000, however, bankers' deposits- or market resources--were only Â£1.6 millions less at Â£109,608,747, still a very respectable figure. 4ANKINI l' D Ir'M1tNTl Week tided tick erdeiilj. tor'I. 141 Se pt.. - 13ti Sept. . t owee 1938 939 93 w e Â£ L.lAuit.reiE - 1: Â£ .680.688 test ... 3.676,458 + 8,663 1.569.786 Pu lii dnepsilt ... 12,001.20 1- 3.028,220 135,969.648 Other deporit* ...1 150.425,495 - 2,078.949 99.593 044 Banker, ............ 109.608.747 - 1.658.249 36.37t.604 Otlher arounts.. 40,816.748 420.700 98,531.164 irt. seenritie... 123.671,164 ,- 50.000 27.949.471 Other securitieÂ»... 29.796.441 1,433.155 5,879.7824 1) isrount and advnce ..... 3.838.425 2.1.8092 22,069.689 .curiiep ......... 25,938.016 + 724.937 47.821.624 Notes.......... .... 6.6b.702 3,564.449 1.470,863 Gold and ilver ... 34.855 50,911 49.292,487 IReerve.............. 27.186,557 - 3.615.360 31.2 pC Ittio ................. 16.7 p - 1.7 wp ISSUE DIEPARTMENT Â£ | Â£ Â£ 526.414.273 Notes mud..... .. 580126.633 + 24.444 478,592.649.

   "text_content" : "HEARING NEXT WEEK By our INDUSTRIAL CORRESPONDENT Despite the passing of control of the railways to the Government, the railway- men's wage claims are being pursued. They will be heard by the Railway Staff National Tribunal in London on Tuesday next. This decision introduces a further ele- ment of uncertainty into the market for Home Railway storks. It is already anxiously awaiting a statement as to the Government's intentions regarding the amount and form of compensation to be paid the lines for their control and use. No decision on this matter has yet been made and it is unlikely that an early state- ment will be forthcoming. The unions' claims, if granted in full, are estimated to cost the companies some Â£2,300,000 in a full year. Since the last weekly traffic figures were issued on 30th August, the railways have had a period of intensive working. Although because of the nightly black-out there has been some decline in ordinary passenger traffic, it is believed that on balance the movement of traffic is con- siderably higher than in recent months. Even allowing for the fact that much of it is carried at special rates it is probable that were the traffics still published they would show increases. Editorial comment Page 2 Col. 1",

Perturbation at the consequences of the \"heavy premiums \" fixed for the Govern- ment's scheme was expressed at a meeting in Edinburgh yesterday of representatives of nearly 20 national organisations of traders in Scotland. While the meeting recognised that the larger trader had no option, it was felt that the small trader with stocks valued at under Â£1,000 could not afford to participate in the voluntary scheme. Protests against the measure were also expressed in other trade centres yesterday.",

   "text_content" : "The official control of new issues of securities, to which attention was again called in a leading article in THE FINANCIAL TIMES yesterday, is very wide in its scope. There is evidence that the full implications are not every- where realised. The broad principle, laid down in Section 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations Amendment Order, 1939, is that \" it shall not be lawful, except with the consent of the Treasury . . . . to make an issue of capital in the United Kingdom . .\" Such issue is defined as the issue of \" any securities (whether for cash or otherwise)\" or the receipt of money on loan in the expectation that it will be repaid by an issue of securities. SOME EXEMPTIONS Certain exemptions from the need to apply for consent have been granted, as announced in THE FINANCIAL TIMES of 4th September, and the list is here reproduced: - (a) issues of securities where the value of the consideration therefor, together with the value of the consideration for any other securities issued by the same person within the preceding twelve months end- ing with the date of the issue in question, is less than five thousand pounds; (b) issues by local authorities in the United Kingdom except issues of stock, bonds (other than local bonds), bills and promissory notes; (c) issues for the purpose of (i) sub- dividing any securities into securities of a smaller denomination, or (ii) consolidating any securities into securities of a larger denomination, so long as, in either case, the operation does not involve the sub- scription of any new money; SHARE ALLOTMENTS (d) allotments of shares by a private company to the vendors of any under- taking if no part of the consideration for the allotment of the shares consists of cash; (e) issues of securities on the amal- gamation of two or more companies in exchange for the securities of those com- panies, so long as the operation does not involve the subscription of any new money and none of the amalgamated companies have, at any time after the coming into force of Regulation 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, 19i9, issued any securities without the consent of the Treasury by virtue only of :ub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph of this order; (f) issues of securities in pursuance of a binding obligation entered into before 3rd September, 1939. It will be seen that such transactions as loans by banks or others to local authori- ties or other borrowers require the prior authority of the Treasury, if their repay- ment would depend upon public borrowing. By inference such operations as the capi- talisation of reserves, not being specifically excepted, also would constitute an offence unless officially authorised in advance. Treasury approval must be sought, in all cases not clearly exempted, via the Capital Issues Committee, 76, King Wil- liam-street, London, E.C.4.",

Some pig-iron makers in Pittsburg have raised prices by $2 per ton on all grades. The \"Iron Age\" weekly journal, in estimating this week's mill activity at 71 per cent. of capacity, against 59 per cent. last week, states that a tremendous volume of orders, assuming almost fantastic pro- portions, is pouring in on steel producers from domestic consumers. They are fear- ful alike of a rise in prices and a shortage of supplies in the fourth quarter. Instead of mere replacement orders, steel consumers are in many instances ordering three or four times their usual quantitiel. Fourth-quarter prices may be announced this week, and no general in- crease is expected despite the rising coats. Wall Street Markets Page 1 Cols. 2 and 3"

The Government is expected to announce the suspension of work now proceeding in registering properties for valuation and probably indicate future procedure. . The Coal Commission, which has so far only been able to do a small amount of preparatory work in the matter of amalgamations will, of course, continue in being. MACHINERY SET UP Much of the valuation machinery,' in- eluding registration of properties and the appointment of the district valuers, for the assessment of mineral royalties had been completed. This work was to have been finished by 1st July, 1942, when all coal would become vested in the State, the global sum of Â£66,450,000 being allo- cated to royalty owners as compensation. It would obviously be impossible to have these registrations continuing in a time of such difficulty. At the request of the Government, representatives of coal owners and the miners' leaders are to meet in London next Thursday to consider the question of in- creasingi output and other problems arising out of the war. OVERSEAS TRADE The Overseas Trade Department is to carry on. Mr. R. S. Hudson, the Minister, will make a statement in the House next week on its future functions.
