Far from being impressed by Mr. Wilson's calcula- tions, the Zambians have produced their own figures to show that san(tions are relatively a far greater burden on Zambia than on Britain, and that their effect on the Rhode- sian economy is less than British official estimates would suggest. The Zambian Ministers have even said that they do not believe that mandatory sanctions -advocated by a number of other African delegations - would bring down the Smith regime, and they are still press- ing for Britain to use fbrce. Test of Britain's Sinearly . More immediately, .Zambia has circulated to the Conference a draft resolution designed above all to test the sincerity of Mr. Wilson's intentions in Rhodesia. It calls on the -British Government to arinnounc that: 1-A period of direct rule by the Britih Govyernment would prp. ced te rat ;of independence to Rhodesla. 2-R de will not be granted inmde e unless ahd until it Siis J dby a governmaet v1th majority of t4 basis 0s6i 0n m. a t tq9 stay in e, t it out, rather Sflhanc s smay haVb on Wr ta.Â«Psidg t t mayd may still decid to leave the Comn Monwealth if he does hot get satisfaction on tese two points. Mr. Wilod is, on paper, com- mitted to a period of direct rule by the Lagos Conference in Feb- ruary, but British oficials tend to regard this commitment as having been overtaken by events-notably by the \"talks about talks\" be- tween Britain and Rhodesia. It Is even beinsuggetd in Whitehall that the dirt rule\" may be a urely te4hn4el exercise, lsting or minutes rather than years, in the event of an agreement involv- in1 Mr. Smith's continuation as Prime Minister.

Mr. Wina charged that Britai was trying to use her Â£14m. ai offer as a.threat to keep Zambi in the Commonwealth; it had bee made clear,to Zambia that if ther were a break in relations, the offe would be reconsidered. He also disagreed with th British view that Zambian import were the loophole which.had mad sanctions ineffective; South Afric and Portugal, in his view, wer loohboles which would continu to help Rhodesia even if Zambi had a phased cut off of her trade Mr. Wina said that Zambia direct government expenditur arising out of sanctiops came s far to Â£7m., and he estimated th budgetarycost at m. t w iacal -year. n and 1.mnoj t deelp plans, .Il s was, K.lairvelytfa gread of the hanaiacot ofdeeation to the British economy. tw Call F6r a Timne Limit At a CommonweAlth Writen lunch, Mr. J.

A communication regarding the surcharge was sent to the Court yesterday by the Retail Fruit Trade Federation and by Mr. Tom Lynch, president of the National S.Uaion -of Small Shopkeepers-the Satest move in what is fast bccom- ing-a nation-wide revolt by retailers against the wholesalers' surcharge. Mr.; Lynch said yesterday: \"The sircharge: is more or less .a .sales tax and appears to be an infringement of the Restrictive Practices Act. If it is allowed to stand we can anticipate further sur- charge!4 being passed on to the. S\"Attehinpts to impose the levy follow a recommendation by the National Federation of Fruit and Potato Trades to its members. It appears that a . rec mendation of this kind must be r-egfsered with the Registrar of .A,\" Restrictive Trade Practices.

The Miistny of: Agriculture haa asked for tbh fullest dtails behind the recommendation of the whole. saler's national body and is expected. to comment within the next few. days. A Retail Fruit Trade Federation spokesman said yesterday: \"We ate very concerned, because we don't know where this thing is going to end.. In some areas the charge has gone up to 4d. because secondary retailers are also putting on 2d to cover their expenses. This thing can snowball. and we think the proper thing is to kill it at birth,\" he added. Replying to the charges, Mr. E. J. Lever, secretary of the ..National Federation of Fruit and Potato Trades, which represents 90 per cent. of Britain's wholesalers, said it was \"not true\" that the surcharge more than covered the wholesalers' Selec. tive Employment Tax.",

I r Pe e for his b tile. -phone uad dalid tharesponsible round to. the Ministry for imme- diate talks on the situation. As, it tnunpirtd. the y4arter was satisfited witÃ½hensxplmnation that current supplies were -out of line with additional seasonal de- mand. and the increase was llowd1 to stand. In fact. there has been a further rise in bacon prices since for this reason, but the matter threw light on an organisation whose members have been estab- lishing bacon, butter, cheese and lard prices since 1887. To some,. the system used to price bacon is more in keeping with that year than 1966. It is only fair to say. however, that any pressure tor change has come from certain members.of the London Provision Exchange them- selves. They feel that as things stand the consumer is not paying a price for bacon that is fully in keeping with the immediate supply and demand position. Nation-wide Before examining areas for im- provement, it is necessary to see what happens on the Exchange at 10.30 every Thursday moring. At this time, in an imposing building on the south side of London Bridge, gather its members who represent almost the whole of the importers and distributors of Commonwealth and foreign provisions. The U.K. bacon and dairy inddstry is also well represented by both buyers and seilers. Bacon is by far the most im- portant commodity dealt in. for, among other things, the prices quoted at the Exchange each week are those that will apply through- out the whole country. There is no auction element on the floor of the LPE; no cries of \" what am I bid for 50 bales of Danish A.\" Instead the day begins with a con- sultative meeting between members representing all sides of the food trade. Representatives of the multiple grocery and wholesale businesses report on current trad- ing conditions, and the agents of foreign .shippers give indications *of the present and potential supply position. After .the consultative meeting, the ,antg 'ti pt5rgthsg all the bacon 'k ostla co41= with- draw, separaly to ewhat they are going to do about prices for the current week. The Danes go into a huddle, as do the Irish, Poles. and so on. \"The English agents of honeoproduced bacon are not allowed to fSt prices be- cause of the Restrictive Practices Act: their quotations are based on business already done. Standhig Orders For Britain, bacon pricing is based on the same system used on the ExPhange for determining cur- rent prices for butter, cheese and lard, where each commodity has a committee to examine returin sent in weekly by both buyer and seller members of the Exchange. These committees have the right to query any return made by a member be- fore its acceptance, but the actual price published is based on the returns for cdinmodities klready sold on an ex-ltare or an ex-quay basis. This system gives a fair guide to price based on business done and paid for-or at least the buyer knows what he has got to pay for the product at the time he picks it up. The same is not true of bacon, for the bulk of this is collected by the buyer from the quayside before the Thursday price-fixing session. Not knowing how much the bacon will cost until after delivery is a nonsensical enough trading system as it is, but another sore point with many of the bigger traders is the \"Standing Order\" carrot that the bacon importers have dangled in front of buyers for many years now. It is estimated that well over 90 per cent. of Danish bacon is sold under this form of contract for a start.' If a wholesaler guarantees to buy. say, 20 bales of bacon every week by standing order then he does not ha've to pay any price rise until the following week. On the other hand. if the price goes down he can take immediate advantage of- it. On the surface, this appears to be a very reasonable arrangement, but any sudden weakening in con- sumer demand means that the buyer is unable to cut back his purchasing to prevent the build-up of unwanted stocks. The foreign bacon importers insist on, a period of three weeks elapsing 'before a stading order is cancelled, al- ouh e Danes have now edu til to two weeks, which, is a step in the right direction. The lack of speed shown by importers' agents in lowering their bacon prices in times of market weakness has also caused consider- able criticism. What it all boils down to is that the present method of bacon pricing is very far removed from the \" free market\" concept, and the consumer must inevitably suffer. If there were to be a sharp cutback in the tonnage sold under standing order, with buyers able to bid freely against each other for supplies, then the resultant competition would ensure that Britain s most expensive grocery item' was always sold at the most realistic price. i The buyers themselves are not completely blameless. After the war, when bacon was in short supply, far too many were only too pleased to sign contracts to ensure a regular weekly ration, and they are now left with the con- sequences. Short Supply At the moment, bacon is in short supply due to a sharp fall in pig numbers both here and in Europe. so the importers once again have circumstances in their favour in resisting any change in their trading methods. In fact. it is only the current high price of bacon that is equating supply with demand. Weekly consumption is now only running at about 11,400. 11,500 tons a week compared with around 12,000 tons at the same time last year. This is not surpris. * ing when it is considered that the housewife is paying at least 8d a pound more for her rashers. The London Provision Exchange itself is an efficiently run organisa- tion which lays down a strict code of trading practice for its members, but has neither the power nor the authority to dictate prices. This is left to the various groups of members and the strength of their bargaining powers. However, as the past few months are beginning to show, it is the consumer who eventually decides the right selling price for bacon, and not the shipper or the wholesaler. Inevitably, the supply position will improve, and the housewife a will have to be wooed back to buy- ing the amount of bacon she is managing to do without now. She may then need more convincing that she is getting the best of the bargain.",

WEST AUSTRALIAN wheat growers expect to bring in a 120m. bushel crop in the coming season, well above last year's record of 103m. bushels.

But the close was above the worst as selling abated in late dealings. After a day's high and low of 787.30-771. the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished another 4.95 down at 777.39. The Railroad Index further declined 1.61 to 192.50 and the Utilities Index reacted 0.57 to 124.15. Trading volume of 5.53m. shares increased by 1.18m. from yester- day's lowest total in three months. Numerous operators were await- ing developments. A fight was shapinq up in Congress on Bills to lower interest rates and the possi- bility continued that the Admini- stration might seek a tax rise or rescinding of the tax credit for business investment. Some quarters said the market was reflecting worries about cor- porate profits. They pointed out that tight money and high interest rates, combined with rising costs, threatened a profits squeeze and possibly a reduction ia the level of business activity until some adjustment was made. Recoveries from the lows were particularly evident among the more volatile shares. After losses exceeding $9, Polaroid finished S81 down at $132 and Fairchild Camera were off S6% at S164%. Xerox converted a SS% decline to NEW YORK, Sept. 7. a S2% advance at $162%. . Televisions were aga affected by profit taking deite spreading selected colour TV set price in- creases.

The plutonium would be used by Euratom for its co-operative research efforts to develop an advanced atomic power plant. The sale of the plutonium mus-i still be approved by C6ngress. Because there is the conceivable possibility that the plutonium might be diverted to military use- plutonium was once used exclu. sively to make atomic bombs-it is conceded that some members of Congress may baulk at the sale. Nevertheless, two years ago Con- gress did give its approval to a sale of 500 kilogrammes of pluto- nium to Euratom. Euratom requested this further sale of 1,000 kilogrammes this spring to meet its breeder-reactor research needs for the next five years. The sale. is important because it allows the U.& to demonstrate its desire to promote European unity; but it also raises the complicated question of what safeguards should be imposed to make sure that the material is not used for military purposes.",

Thi foflowing is his circulated statement: The consolidated profit 'of the companies operating in the United Kingdom is Â£193,000 after all chares ut before taxation. From i re e must deduct the loss mde by bur' Australian compahy of Â£42,000, leaving a trading prqfit for the Group of Â£151,000. This compares with Â£103,000 last year. Taxation for the year amounted to'Â£71,000 leaving Â£80,000 available for distribution and added to the amount brought forward from the previous year, gives a Group figure available for dividends of Â£317,000. During the year we rationalised our investments in our various sub- sidiary companies and the move- ments in the reserves are specific- ally mentioned in the accounts. We have also taken the opportunity of bringing our stock reserve back to its original figre of Â£300,000 by transferrng Â£43,000 to this reserve out of the current year's profits. During the year a 2%% Interim Dividend was paid and later, a further Interim Dividend of 7/ o% in lieu ot a tinal dividend, making 10% for the year. These dividends, together with the Preterence divi- dend cost Â£37,000 net after taxa- tion, leaving Â£252,000 to carry forward for next year. Kanitting Wool Division The year under review was the second of two difficult years for the knitting wool trade. In spite of this the Division made a satis- factory profit and Emu continues to be a leading name in the knit- ting wool market. This Spring, our spinning mills, dyehouse and distribution centres were re-organised under one com- pany. Previously they had been operating as three separate units; this will result in economies and higher efficiency. I am glad to report that in recent months there has been an improv;- ment in the general demand for hand knitting yarns. The current sales of our Emu branded yarns are running at a higher level than in the same period last year. Emu Wools. (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Our business in Australia is ob- tainina an increasing share of the, hand knitting wool market and for the six months to 31st March, 1966 showed a small profit. However, the marketing costs are incurred in the.latter part of the financial year and I anticipate another loss for the year ending September next but Iass than that of last year. I am sure the volume of sales will continue to increase in this expanding market and in the long term our investment in Australia will prove beneficial to the com- pany. Ladies Wear Division Our company manufacturing and marketing the Slimma range of garments has had another excel- lent year. For several years now we have seen a steady growth in turnover and profitability In this Division and this year has been no exception.

   "text_content" : "RADIO RENTALS LIMITED THE FUTURE AND COLOUR TELEVISION The following is an extract from the statement made by the Chairman, MR. J. W. C. ROBINsoN, M.B.E., M.A., at the Twenty-Ninth Annual General Meeting of the Company held, on 7th September, 1966. The Group trading profit for the year to 28th February 1966 was Â£7,351,500, which shows an improvement of about 9 per cent. over the previous year. This year, taxation is based on the new Corporation Tax and Â£2.086,400 has been provided, leaving a net profit for the year of Â£5.265,100. Due to the change in our accounting date, taxation' provisions relating to previous years of Â£1,400,000 are now released. This, together with Â£407,000 from the Tax Equalisation Account, has been sei aside to provide extra Depreciation by direct transfer in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, to write off the balance of cost of all old types of television sets with screens below the 19-inch size. Group Rewairdtloni To: accaleraterth benefits .xpected from the mergat of Radio Rentals and Reitaset, it was decided to rd-organise' all activities into four Divii sions-(l) Rental (2) Manufacturing (3) Retail & Wholesale. (4) Wired Services and Miscellaneous, and new Subsidiary Companies to control these came into operation on 1st March 1966. Executive Boards for each of the new Divisions now function and the re-grouping is already showing satisfactory results. The Executive Boards form a vital link in our control of the business, and provide a ladder of promotion for staff to the Group Board. Our Boardroom door is open to any employee who has the ability and ambition to reach it, and I hope many will resolve to try to do so. To give a tangible expression to the Identity of interests which exist between staff and shareholdert, in 1965, Stock Options over 622,000 shares at about 46s. Od. per share .were granted to some 700 staff. It is unfortunate that recent taxation changes rob them of a great deal of the benefit we intended to confer. This incentive was spread widely and was not limited to a few top-level executives. Rental and General Trading Coaditions When presenting a view of the circumstances surrounding television rentalat the present time, one must try to give a true and fair presentation of our situation and prospects, It is admitted we have more shadows across our screen than was the case a few years ago. For instance, there is a state of near saturation in the total television market, Competi- tion, although a little less keen, remains fierce. We also face the loss of investment allowances, and the change to Corporation Tax is not favourable. Costly provisions will be required for our engineer. ing staf to be trained In the more advanced tech. niques of colour set servicing, We must also be prepared for those contingen- cleis nvolved out of the growing use of transistors and, eventually, integrated circuits. To service rolour sets, considerable investments in expensive test gear and additional workshop facilities, well In advance of any prospects of Income out of this new development, are necessary. We must also build up stocks of colour lots to be well prepared for the initial demand, But above all else the darkest shadow Is caused by the severe restrictions of the Credit Squeeze, which, through the Control of Hiring Order, requires that we obtain a down pay- ment equivalent to the total of 42 weeks rental before a new set can be installed. Happily this is only half the story and there are several actors to offset these drawbacks, One bright feature is that the very fundamental qharacter of our rental business promise a stable Income on which we can rely m Whilst It can be assumed most householdo have one television set It Is also stated that probably not more than about 60 per cent. of the sets now used S rented and, I this s so, there must be some oops t for rental when thes sets wear out and have to be replaced, As regards the changes In tarxoati It ti some- times overooked that we have Al granted or still expect to obtain all the be efits of nystmen allowances on those sets already n circulation and to be del vered In fulfilment of firm contracts plced prior to the date of the offolal announcement, For he future, we have no alternative but to ensure that rn1al rates are suicient to provide for the proper eplacenent of all such assets coming Into 5 on the new bass, and to help to meet those additional out. Nolnii due to the change to Corporaton Tax, and Sintroduction of S.T. We also plan to cope with some she consequenne through econoie which have still to be reaped from the merger o( 1064.

This money must beconirve Itt c pany gl to bo capable of flnanolil part o the costs of moving into colour. For my own part I am very confident we shall do as well as any company in this field during present difficulties. Colour Television Whilst we believe it would be wrong to antici- pate easy profits out of the early years of colour television, it is also our belief that most forecasts of its -slow development over those years will be surpassed. In this country we begin being able to short circuit the teething troubles which held back development in Lks early days in America on both the broadcpasting and the set sides. It is a great advantage; In that at the outset .programmes will rea soe 75' or cent. of our population and for no, ss \"ab but 20 hours per week. Of course, a great de will deed on the character of the colour prog uto duced. The sets which we shall produce be le, incorporating the benefits of 15 years of American manufacturing experience. The real danger is that the present crisis in the finances of the B.B.C. could be the menace to first- class colour programmes. We can well understand the disappointment it must be for those in I.T.A. to be excluded from participating in programmes in colour, but, we think it would be a great mistake if their programmes are to be allowed to go into colour on 405 lines. This would mean the manu- facturing industry and the public would virtually be stranded for ever with the extra costs of dual stan- dard sets both in black and white and in colour. The original Government policy when 625-line broad- casting was introduced was that eventually all pro- grammes would be receivable on 625 lines only. We are convinced that the best hope for good pro- grammes in colour would be for the existing 625-line broadcasting channel and stations to be shared equally between the B.B.C. and I.T.A. Then within about ten years, we could look forward to.a single standard broadcasting system as was originally planned, which would be much cheaper, more am- cient, and more reliable. The present disappointing record in exports of domestic television sets might then improve, and the industry would, at least, have a chance to compete on equal terms with other countries within the same system. Manufacturing Division All manufacturing operations are now grouped under a single overall control. The Baird unit in Bradford, suppUes the majority of our needs in television sets drS allied products, and Is well advanced In Its prepair0ns for the production of colour sets during 1967. The Goodmans Loudspeaker production In Wembley has been re-organised and, in spite of the difficulties in the home market, succeeded in expanding turnover on the export side, with some very outstanding new products. Our Aluminium Processing Factory, in Weymouth, has Increased Its turnover, and i4 also showing satisfactory returns for the Group. The present building restrictions have created' difficulties In our Birmingham factories, which produce special design metalt windows, street lamp standards, and other aluminium Items, but moderate profits should continue to be earned. Retail and Wholesale Divislon The present severe restrictions create similar difficulties for this Division as for Rental, Our Wholesale Division, which is concerned with the supply of television and similar products to the retail trade, is affected by the same general Influences. Wikd omleea Dlivlon All activities ds this nature are now groued under the control of the Wired Services Executive Director Our Television Relays are growing and It e Inteded ro expand into the feld of close-olrcult television.

FRANK YouNo (Chairi uan and Managing Director) presided and the following ,s his' circulated statement: I have pleasure in presenting to the shareholders the Accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March, 1966. The Profit before taxation amounts to Â£227,296, compared with Â£218,934 last year, an increase of Â£8,362. -* Due to the introduction of Corporation Tat the charge for taxation on profits for the year is less than for the previous year, but W. have now to account to the Revenue Authorities for tax * deductible from-the Final Dividend and in future years this will also apply to any interim dividend which may be declared. Sh Board had been contemplating the payment of an in. creiased Final Dividend, but in view of the Government's recent teqUest have decided to recommend the same Final Dividend as last year, viz. 12%% which with the Interim Dividend of 7Y,% aleady paid makes a total of 20% for the year. This is as forecast 'i the Prospectus. Whilst our Sales were higher than last year, this increase was nearly absorbed in meeting an increased wage bill and the extra cost of purchased materials for our products. The new range of Vulcan Gas-fired Boilers. introduced in September 1965. has been very well received and will further con- tribute to increased sales during the current year. Our Research Department are constantly engaged on the development of new products, some of which will be introduced during the next few months, and I feel certain the Company will contnue to-take a leading part in the Gas central heating industry in this country. Negotiations are nearing completion for the purchase of approximately 7 acres of land adjoining the present Works and this will enable our expansion programme to be proceeded with and I am hopeful that new buildings and plant will be available before the end of the present financial year. Our. capital commitments as shown are only part of a plan:' to modernise and to install new plant to increase our production. I feel that we can look forward to the future of the Company with optimism and that we shall be able to share in. the future expansion of the Gas Industry. Finally, I would like on your behalf to thank all our Staft and Employees for their efforts during the past year. without which such satisfactory results would not have been possible. The report and accounts were adopted. ft",

   "text_content" : "Froim Our Own Correspondent BONN, Sept. 7. The favourable turn taken by West Germany's foreign trade Uas made a strong impact on the country's balance of payments. Helped by a DM921nm. (about Â£84m.) surplus on visibles in July-the highest since February, 1964-the accumulated deficit on current account since the beginning of the year was down to DM.1,080m. In the same seven months of 1965 it had amounted to DM3.499r - -- Until July of this year the Bundesbank's external reserves had risen by DM.774m., against a loss of DM.1,598m. in January to July, 1965. After eliminating short term capital movements and special transactions the basic balance showed a small deficit of DM.943m., against DM.3,075m. last year. The improvement in the foreign trade balance was the product of rapidly rising exports and of a sharp decline in the growth of im- ports. Exports did well as a re- sult of demand from the United States and to a lesser extent from the other Common Market coun- tries. This trend is going to con- tinue: up to the end of July the volume of export orders booked was 13 per cent, higher than in the same period of last year. Significantly the capital goods industries, which lagged for a time, have lately pro8ted from the growth of export demand. At least in part this must be the result of the credit squeeze having cut down heavily on home demand. This, too, is the reason for the reduced growth of imports of raw materials and semi. fimnshed products. Main reason However, the main reason for the overall growth of importis having fallen to-little more than 6 per cent., against export growth of 11 per cent, is a falling off of arms pur. chases.. The slowing down of industrial growth to about 3 'per .cent. has helped to bringa-crtain measutre of relief also to the labour market. The 106.000 unemployed are still heavily outnumbered by 594,000 vacant posi- tions. But the disproportion has been improving over the months. Last month was the first August since 1961 during which the number of unemployed actually increased.",

Soundings have been taken in Washington and the matter will be brought before the Alliance. Britain, which never fell in with the embargo (although she sold no BONN.

Feelings ran high in German indus- try when in 1963 the Government vetoed a Russian order for 163,000 tons of pipe for use in a gas pipeline. The Russians have lost few oppor. tunities to complain to Bonn about the step then taken. A modification of the embargo now could therefore help to improve' the atmosphere for the forthcoming German-Soviet trade talks.",

BRUSSELS, Sept. 7. In banking circles it is not expected that interest rates will fall in the early future, and it is even suggested the upward trend may not have run its full course. The Government intends to remain a big borrower. Its 1967 calls on the capital market for the public works budaet are officially estimated at some B.Fras.36.000m.. or B.Frs.6.00Om. more than this year. Though the revenue budget esti. mates for 1967 are technically in balance. at the record tigure of B.Frs.220.650m.. there are fears that the revenue estimates may not be fully realised owing to at least a moderate business recession. The underlying areument is that the heavy Government borrowing will leave in. sufficient funds for the big industrial development requirements and that the forcedly higher interest rates will check investment proarammeb.

After 1966.-it reports that some experts now predict between 30 and 40 per cent. of all new plant will be nuclear fuelled, with coal-burn- ing equipment counting for most of the remainder. The development of \"turnkey' nuclear plants has enabled construc- tors to make considerable economies, with the result that in certain cases tender prices have fallen to $120 per kW-a figure that had previously on been thought possible after Nevertheless, thermal stations are still, increasing their. share of total capacity in the OECD, counting for 62 per cent. in 1963. and probably 70 per cent. for 1970. At the end of last year, total productive capacity had climbed to 201,000 MW from 185.000 MW in December, 1964. At 6.7 per cent., the growth in PARIS, Sept. 7. electricity consumption in the OECD last year was one of the smallest on record, however. Although higher than the 6.3 per cent. increase recorded in 1958, it was significantly below the figure of 7.9 per cent. achieved in 1964. On the other hand, the survey believes that electricity consumption will continue to grow at a faster rate than the member countries' economies as a whole. It pinpoints Japan as a nation where there is still consider- able growth potential, and consump- tion should rise at an annual average rate of 10.3 per cent. over the period 1963-69. Although very substantial economies have already been made in electricity generation in Western Europe as a result of improved network connec- tions, the OECD's experts believe that a further 11.500 MW could still be saved in this way.",

PaNN: Th trading results fof' 1965/6 do not differ significantly from those of ,the previous, yearo Demand was again well mataid throughout the year- The value of: Group sales at Â£11 ,69000 repred' sents an idcrease of 8% over 1964/65, reflecting in pan the higher prices of tungsten products, arising from the sharp uplift in the world price of wolfram ore. Keeit competition and rising 'costs lowered. profit margins and the. trading surplus of Â£1,133,000, after, charging depreciation compares with Â£,12000 for he previous year which i 3ncluded Â£3,000 for a special item of depreciation. At Rainham, the supply of molybdenite concentrates which improved gradually during the year was still insufficient to meet custo- mers' needs. The world price of wolfram ore rose from 190/-d. per unit at the previos year-end to a eak of 375/-d, at end-February, 966 its h est value since the Korean War, falling to 300/-d; at the year-end. Gains arising from these price fluctuations were, there- fore, considerably greater than those of the previous year and the transfer to Stock Contingency' Reserve has been increased accord- ingly. Shortly before the beginning of the financial year, imported natural gas had been introduced as a replacement for manufactured town gas as fuel for the major furnace installations in the Works. Hopes for substantial benefits from the change were fully realized through- out the period under review. The consistency, cleanliness,. high calorific value and low sulphur content of the new fuel permitted much closer control of heating installations than had hitherto been possible although it is quite clear that much remaibs to be done to exploit the advantages fully. Efficiencies have been raised and: this, coupled with a lower price per unit, has resulted in considerable savings in costs of production. SPars that supplies might be unduly vulnerable to political or industrial unrest have been dispelled during the early part of the present sinan- cial year by the maintenance of full service throughout the period of the seamen's strike. I am glad to record appreciation of the steps taken by the Gas Council and the North Thames Gas Board to ensure the continuity .of fuel supplies. Thermit Welding (G.B.)

CI If .1 11 Io 8 I. 8Â· If The 4th annual general meeting of Allnatt London Properties ULmi d was held on September 7 at anchester House, 77 London Wall London. E.C.2, Ma. R. W. DOMoUZS, O.B.E. (the chairman) 1hes llowing is his statement which had been circulated with the repoti and accounts: SI im glad to report that the Company has completed its fourth CWceusful year. The accounts for the year ended 31st March. 1966, w a total profit of Â£812,616 before taxation, which compares with a total profit of Â£656,400 for thaeprevious year. As it happened, the percentage increase over the upreious year was the same as in 096S--tha very satisfactory figure of 23 per cent. The increase in the Company's tedt oll at 31st March, 1966, was .ust\" 'over' Â£330,000, of which Â£295,000 was in respect of new tuildings, Â£19,000 rental increases ollo sions and alteras tionsk and Â£16,000 in respect of a ground lease. The most ihportant addition during the year was the new distri- bution cantre for 'Gallaher Ltd., at Northolt, valued professionally for debenture purposes at Â£2293,000, and the largest building so far provided by the Company for the specialised needs of a single tenant. The charge- n the accounts for debenture interest includes Â£675,000 (1965 Â£625,529) gross on the Â£10 million cain ihterest at 6% per cent, and ,99- the charge for part of a month on the new deben. ture for Â£2% million placed at Â£98% per cent. on 2nd March 1966, and carrying interest at 79 per cent. The high.rate of interest commanded by this and other debenture stocks for which ample security is given is,.1 regret to say, a pointer towards continuing in. lation. The final instalment of Â£1,462,500 of new debenture money was receivable oni 2nd June, 1966. New deb6nture money was re- quired to finance new premises under erection for tenants .and as additional working capital. Thirteen new buildings were completed during the year, besides extensions and improvements for tenants. I would like to add, in view of the many ill-informed attacks upon property owning compages, that this Company, and theprivate com- panies from which it was formed, have so far provided for occupa- tion over two hundred and twenty new or modernised mostly tsingle storey factories -and' warehouses with two storey vr other appro. priate office accommodation; and five separate office blocks. : Dividenad and, Imdleate Propect, ,s: Shareholders were informed that a second interim dividend was paid on 31st March, l96, n order that the Company iht obtain th a vanta - by the PFinan Act. 6. On n advice. I hve received, the Company will not be accountable for Income Tax upon the equivalent gross amount of this interim dividend as would have been the case if the same dis- tribution had been made to share* holders after Sth April. 1966, It will however be clear' that the. payment of two interim dividends has reduced the rate of the pro. posed flnal dividend to IX per cent (less Income Tax), making a total of 12A per cent (less Income Tax) for the year, against a total of 12 per cent (less income Tax) paid for the year ended 31st arch, 1965. The Directors might have de- lared- a larger toal dividend for the year than 124 per cent, were it not for the drastic changes in taxation involved in future by the combined effect of Corporation Tax (present rate of 40 per cent) on the Company's profits, and the equivalent of a separate withhold- ing tax of 8s. 3d. in the Â£ on profits distributed as dividends to share- holders. In the opinion of the Directors, the dividend of 12% per cent for the year should certainly be mail tainable in spite of the important changes in the basis of taxation to which I have referred, and of the severe handicaps upon the Com- pany's rate of progress which may result from further legislation bear- ing directly upon the ownership and development of land. In the short term the Company's progress should be maintained by the carry- ing through of current contractq and projects. The withdrawal of Investment Allowances was a further unex- pected tax change. Its effect on the Company will over the years be largely offset by the increases made in Initial and Annual Allow. ances. The Directors have however considered it to be desirable to set aside Â£89,500 out of the profits of the year in order to spread the tax charges more evenly over the life of plant installed in the Company's buildings. i The Longer Term The future progress of the Com- pany depends to an important extent on its ability to supply the specialised and modernised build- ings for which it has the sites, and Allnatt (London), Ltd. has the experience, skills and labour force. I am confident that, ultimately, the continued development of indus- trial land in the South East, includ- ing the re-building and modernisa- tion of older buildings in the area, is necessary to the aim of increased general prosperity. The stark facts however are that, in the current political atmosphere, Owners and developers of land are , encountering continuous obstruc- tion and are to be subjected to a further spate of legislation based on more elaborated controls and schemed deprivation. It is slight comfort that legislation of similar type has failed in the past owing to proved impracticability. New controls and their projected enlargement in many directions are already affecting the Com- pany's progress. Planning machinery in the South East, and in Greater London particularly, has indeed aporoached paralysis. Qualified staff, too few for present taskg,, are however to be expected to assume the additional duties anid responsibilities: which will follow from:- The Industrial Development Bill The Land Commission. Bill The Building Control B111 all now before Parliament, The Company's propertles are well situated and. in good condi- tion. If new developments are frustrated or prevented, dehmand. for existing factories and other industrial buildings will intensify. Increased demand, rising costs and such new factors as betterment levies and payroll tax will force up rents. Most lettings and re- lettings in recent years have guarded against inflation by pro viding for periodical rent revisions. Proiress is being made with developments that were in band or that need no further permis- slons. All In all I would say that whilst discouragement to manage. ment and staff may on occasion be heavy and progress may slow down, the Companv's successful future is not in doubt. The report and accounts were adopted,",

Iolla&d and Indonesia to-night reached agreement on a flnal *etlement of nearly the whole of the Indoauban debt to tb1 Netherlands State, Dutch companies and private individuals. Originally, the value of this debt had beeo calculated at some- . Orignally, the value of this bing like Fl.4,500m. (Â£450m.). . In -all, Indonesia will pay FI.On00M. (f60m.). A sum of Fl.36m., which bhd already beer paid into -a frozen account by In- donesia last year, will be released to Holland in'two equal parts o0 December 31, 1966 and 1967. After that there will be a six- Year standstill, followed by 3( annual instalments of the remain- ing F1.564m., so that the final pay ment should reach Holland in the year 2002. On the sums outstand ing after 1973 Indonesia will pay Holland interest at the rate of 1 per cent. The compensation for the volun- tary nationalisation of two Dutch public utility companies in Indo- nesia is not included in this agree- ment. Hardship Cases In announcing the agreement, Wr. Joseph Luns, the Dutch Foreign Minister, said the first F1.36m. to be released this year ind next will be used to help the nost severe Dutch hardship cases. He was understood to refer to iome of the thousands of Dutch ndividuals who had to leave their 'elongings behind when they were !hrown out of Indonesia in the late 50s. The F1.600m. will not be subject o re-negotiation when Indonesia neets all her commercial creditors, ncluding Holland, at Tokyo later his month. As part of the agreement. Holland will help Indonesia with gifts. loans, ind bank credits totalling Fl.66m. luring the rest of this year. and with a further, as yet unspecified, sum in 1967. Holland also expects to be able o release her $30m. contribution to he UN Development Fund for West Irian as soon at Indonesia rejoins the UN.I When both delegations met re Dorters.after the initialling ceremony, Mr. Luns pointedly refused to answer a question whether the. road was now oen to invite the Indonesian Head o SState to visit Holland. Mr. Joop den' Uyl, the Dutch Economic Minister, will visit Indo- nesia for more detailed talks on Dutch-Indopesian co-operation pro. jects \"in the near future.\" The leader of the Indonesian dele- gation, Sultan Hamengku Buwono IX, expressed his appreciation of Hol- land's \"hospitalist, goodwill and understanding.\" Te delegation then left for London, where negotiations with the. British Government will begin to-morrow. U.K. Talks An Indonesian mission is to. have talks in London to-day and on Friday. about the deferment of Indonesia's commercial debts and British assets in Indonesia. Mr. George Brown, the Foreign Secretary, will open the neeting at which the Indonesian team will be led by the Sultan of Jogjakarta, who, as a member of Indonesia's five-man ruling Praeaidium. is responsible for economic and financial matters.",

This was an- nounced yesterday by the Premier, Dr. Youssef Zeayyen, in a speech at the army barracks near Damascus. Dr. Zeayyen made his visit with Major-General Ahmed Sweidani, the Chief of Staff, in order to whip up the Army's sup- port following the announcement yesterday of the destruction of a conspiracy to overthrow the rugime and reinstate the followers of the deposed pan-Arab International Command of the Baath Party. Ob- servers here believe Dr. Zeayyen's statement was meant to reassure the armed forces that they will get their share of the royalties. Dr. Zeayyen said in his speech that the first session of negotidtions with IPQ to discuss 'the increase in royalties on the company's pipe- line, which passes through Syria, will begin next Saturday. \"We shall have them account for all the money they made us lose,\" he said. The Government claims that it is getting less than half of what it BEIRUT, Sept. 7. should be getting in IPC transit royalties. The Syrian Premier said extra royalties will be invested in the Syrian economy and in purchasing more arms for the Syrian Army to strengthen its military position. Syria now buys all its weapons and military equipment from the Soviet Union. In fact, stressing the rdgime's oil policy is part of the current psy- chological campaign waged in the wake of the discovery of the con. spiracy. Dr. Zeayyen in his speech claimed that the leaders of inter- national command were in col- lusion with \"imperialist oil companies \" because they allegedly sought to overthrow the regime after the latter demanded nego- tiations with IPC for more royalties. \"Red Guards\" Meanwhile. bands of workers are touring offices of State-run companies in Damascus forcing officials to resign at gunpoint because they allegedly were \"reactionaries.\" These armed workers have been dubbed by observers here as' \"Syria's Red Guards.\" in comparison to Peking'* Red Guards.",

Nvertheles . amid the apathy with which the eletilon campaign has been gener- ally received, some Vietnamese intellectuals and patriots find greonds for faint optimism that their unhappy country is about to take the first tiny step along a road which. may, with enormous luck, lead to a representative Govern- ment. Ky's Promise General Nguyen Cao Ky, the Prime Minister, has announced that he will withdraw from poli- tics at the end of next year-after an elected Government has been formed. Normally, such a pledge would be treated with normal Vietnamese cynicism, but even General Ky's severest critics do not accuse him of deviousness and his forthright promise to let go the reigns of power has made people n Saigon at least sit up and take notice. If Ky keeps his word it will establish something of a record in South Vietnari's political experience over the last two decades, and those who remain unimpressed and determinedly modest in their expectations have many past disappointments to support them. In fact, all adult citizens will be legally entitled to vote, but those judged by local screening boards to be Communist or \"proCom- munist neutralists \" are illegible to stand at candidates. In theory, the election will produce 117 delegates to a constituent assembly from South Vietnam's 43 cities, plus special members representing the Montagnards and other tribal com- munities. However, the delegates elected on September 11 will merely be charged with the task .col wil tot mt ca wi VI vis wt to hn of ms the wi ou po in the an sel lia: wa inl Al! rie bn U. ad the of tie en ar Vi ha Nguyen Cao Ky powerful organised political forces in the country-the Vietcong and the United Buddhist Church-took any part, and have pledged them selves to smash the whole exercise. The attitude of the South Viet nam National Liberation Front was summed up recently by Pek ing. The New China News Agency dismissed an election \" car* ried out at gunpoint\" as \" an ugly, brazen farce,\" an attempt by the U.S. and its puppets to clothe an administration which is \"rotten to the core\" with a ' legal figleaf.\" But the real objection on the parn of Hanoi and Peking to any elec tion in the south appeared at the end of the statement with a call for a settlement by the people of South Vietnam \"in accordance with the programme of the South Vietnam Liberation Front.\" The Vietcong has since announced that it cannot guarantee the lives of either can- didates or voters in the election. of datiatcs ugI will t rtm enabl a uture elect torate to vote for a policy-makingla assembly. The pre t election campaign is, thus, largely one without a ise. The impossibility of the South Vietnamese people expreisinstheir views on any o the hug conflict whieh are bleeding their country to death iW only one of many limitations which will enable critics of the present regime to dismiss any claims it makes to legality on the basis of the coming vote. 11 will be simple for them to point out that neither of the two most Oh ttl ch re nl on nc Ith tit cm Iry ist on II ial ,sl :u sd oh mÂ· se~ et ,nl ws an to I.\" arl ec he 'or Ith he Im ng lot mÂ· I. t has Sateli- $41.try li t b ballot ecently repeated its call to its fol lowers \" not to cooperate \" in the election. But today the church represents only a small proportion of the country's Buddhists Churcand still in a state of confusion and disunity following the decisive action taken against its anti- Government activities earlier this year by General Ky. Its main activist. Thich Tri QUaag, con- tinues his fast in a Saigon pagoda and a few days ago was reported to be nearing death.. South Viet. nam's other three main religious communities-the Catholics, the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai 4ects- have also announced their inten- tion of boycotting the election. The religious groups object to the elections on the very natural grounds that the extremely com- plicated voting and the propor- tional representation systems were specifically designed by the Saigon authorities to prevent the Budd- hists. in particular, from sweeping the. seats.in-. areas.. where.. their infuence is strongest. Under a juster system the Buddhists would stand a very good chance of emerg- in with the largest single block o seats, While the military junta will .robably be successful in ensuring that its opponents will not gain dominating positions. it has also ensured the fragmentation of political power. Far from helping to create a new stability the newly elected Assembly will institution- alise the very factionalism which has been the curse of Vietnamese public affairs for centuries-which both the Vietminh and the Viet- cong have exploited. General Ky has promised his .eople that the election will be onest and representative., But the Vietnamese are cynical in such matters.

General Ky has said that be is looking forward to banding over to an elected Government: \" I want togo back to my old job with the honour and the satisfaction that I have served my country.\" It is certain that very few people in South Vietnam to-day could have done better, but doubtful if his best will be good enough. adidates su rted b military and tat 'the teiuift\". boards who have had the power- to eliminate undesirable car didates have been guided in tbhsik verdicts by the provincial c who.are Army offices.

Although other Latin American countries have exchanged technical information with Israel, the scope of the Mexican-Israeli treaty is the broadest to date. Since the two countries have arrived at similar stages in their economic develop. ment and share some common eo. graphic problems affecting agricul- ture, both sides expect important concrete results from the agree- ment. The scarcity of water is one of the principal problems faced by both countries. Israel is expected. to help Mexico in the field of irrigation, and Mexico's contribution is anticipated in the engineering of dams. israel's experience in the field of desalination is also of great interest to Mexico's scientists. who are studying the possi- bilities of development of nuclear energy plants for this purpose. The marketing of agricultural pro- ducts througb co-operatives. developed to a high degree by Israel. is also of interest to Mexico. where distribution and marketing remains one of the country's major economic prohlems.

The reasons must probably be sought in the fluctuations of arms pur- chases and In the slowing-down of German industrial growth. A 23.9 per cent. decline in German pur- chases of British industrial semi- manfacturers in the first six months appears to support this. On the other hand, a 13.9 per cent. increase in Germany buying of wholly-manufactured goods from Britain points in the right direction. Particularly good results were turned in by the makers of office machinery (up 308.5 per cent to DM87m.), of agricultural machinery and tractors (up .69.2 to DM32.6m.), of mechanical handling equipment (up 62 per per cent. to DM7.3m.).",

Through these, Britten- Norman gained experience of air taxi and scheduled services, which have been operated alongside the spraiing setvices in some countries. This aviation experience led Britten-Norman to look carefully at the short-haul market for a light, rugged, simple but above all cheap N areoplane for which they could see ci a large' demand, especially in the et under-developed countries of the ti world. This in turn led to the start o of the design of the Islander in sL April 1964. The programmme im advanced with great rapidity. The si first metal was cut the following ci September, and the prototype made its first flight in June 1965 in time L to appear at the Paris Air Show. ci Two of the aircraft have been per- ei forming .in the flying display at tl the Farnborough Air Show this b week, including the first piroddc- el tion model which made its maiden b flight as recently as August 20. a Carrying up to 10 people, including the pilot, the Islander has been developed specifically for the commercial short-haul operator and it embodies several features which are calculated to make it attractive to a wide range of users. A large cabin with wide doors on either side of the fuselage gives great flexibility for passengers, freight and mixed operations, while the fuselage floor is set sufficiently low for people to get in and out with greater ease than in many motor-cars.. The parts and equip- ment for the aircraft have been selected for their proven reliability and the ease with which spares can be obtained, and this applies ar- ticularly to the two Lycoiiung piston engines, which ared already widely used fn other tvoes of air- craft throughout the world. For charter work, a choice of seat and table arrangements can quickly turn the Islander into a VIP trans- port or \" flying boardroom.\" INN a nvr-s fs eeaesmnh A II n E 9 5' E 51 4 u bb ti b 11 a I ru*el~~or~cr~rlrJ orlla at s Â£18,900 and ordern for more than 30 have beul bopkq4 already with many Inqu rist fcvfuig into the compny' Isle f Wight offices. To help in the development, the Government. his loaned the company just under Â£200,000, matching Brittei-Norman's own investment on the project, and now the company is seeking a fur- ther loan to tinance work in progress. poIt was announced last night at the Air Show dinner in London that the Government had approved this loan to speed up production for export of the Islander aircraft. ft The Britten-Norman Islander. Mr. Norman, welcoming this de- cision, said: \"This loan will enable the company to treble the three-per-month production rate originally planned and thus en- sure that the Islander's present international lead in the field of simple twin-engined light aircraft can be exploited to the full.\" Delivery of the first aircraft to Loganair of Scotland, the first customer, will be made before the end of this year, and delivery of the first 30 aircraft on the order book should be completed by the end of 1967. By that time Britten- Norman expects to have laid down another major batch of aircraft, PARNBOROUGH, Sept. 7. and to be building them at the rate of at least six aircraft a month. It only a small proportion of the in- quiries that are now flowing in , are converted into firm orders, the company should be assured of work on the Islander for a long time to come. Large batches In the western hemisphere it Is intended to appoint a major dis- i tributor who will take aircraft in I large batches and who in turn will I appoint dealers to sell the aircraft to individual customers. The mar- ket in America is thought to ve particularly large. Both Desmond Norman and John Britten firmly believe that the Islander fits into a market that has no immediate competitor and that this, coupled with the aircraft's simplicity and cheapness should make it sell well. In fact, as I sampled the smooth- ness and quietness of the Islander over Hampshire earlier this week, Desmond Norman told me: \"We don't expect any difficulty selling the aeroplane. Our problem will probably be finding ways to build them fast enough to meet the demand. Everybody would like to have delivery now.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Our Industrial Reporter The Prices and Incomes Board yesterday urged both the coa dcitributlou sad lasadry nd dry leaning trades to consider ofsettlag the cost of selective employment tax by reduc. hg th.ir labour riqhhelrments. This. broad recommendation arises from two separate reports oA costs and prices prepared under Government instructions niven earlier this year. Examining the justification fto price rises by launderers and dr; cleaners since mid-1964, the Boari says charges have continued to rie duiin& -1966. \"A number of large dry cleaninj firms have informed us of increase made during the first half of thi year and there is increasinj evidence that charges made b! laundries and small dry cleaner have continued to rise,\" continue the treport, stressing that the Price and Incomes Standstill raised j practical question as result of thi imposition of SET. Although regarding a reduces labour requirement as the \" prefer able way \" of meeting SET, the Board acknowledges that highe] prices would.nmeet the Chancellor'i aim of taking a certain volume o money out of circulation. Laundry mergers As far as the laundry industr3 as concerned, the Board consider that a majo contribution to the ab tlion of the industry's wagei 4l .ome from amalgams tlons. Cots and prices would con tinue to rise in the industry-whick has an annual turrover of aboul 80m.---s its present domestic struc tare was left unchanged. Amalgamation would offer foul advantages: \" A better combinatior Io.commercial and domestic laundr3 activities. the closure of under. utilised establishments and the fulle, use of other establishments, the uss of modern labour-saving equipment and the rationalism of delivery ser vioes.\" The organisation which would merge from the pending amalgams tion of the National Federation ol Dtyers and Cleaners and the Insti tute of British' Launderers and Cleaners should give help to dry cleaners on cost control and advice to potential entrants to the trades. SMore price competition, particu- larly between larger firms. could also help reduce overcapacity,\" comments tbe Board. The report goes on to say that. if the two sectors continued to employ the same number of people, the SET cost would be equivalent, on average, to an increase in costs of 41 per cent. for laundries and 4 per cent. for dry cleaners. And it adds:- \"If some allowance is made for the more economical use of labour and for the fact that to some extent the tax would seem to have been anticipated, the net average effect on prices over the next 12 months should be less than Is indicated by these figures.\" Findings \"Reasonable \" Mr. E. Swetman, director of the Institute of British Launderers and Cleaners, described the Board's general findings as \"reasonable.\" Launderers were only making 8 per r~cwuÂ·raun; Mr. E. Swetman, director of 1& institute of British Launderers and Cleaners, described the Board's general findings as \"reasonable.\" Launaerers were only making 8 per cent. profit on turnover and 13 per cent. on capital employed. Selective employment tax would cost about 4im. out of an annual Â£80m. turnover, so the incidense of the tax would be nearer 6 per cent. not about 4j per cent. Dry cleaners woild pay another Â£3m. \" The Institute accepts the need for the standstill\" stated Mr. Swetman. \"It is no derent in this from the Confederation of British Industry, but we cannot expect our members to bankrupt themselves and I do not think the Government would expect that.\" And he added: \"There is no room for redundancy in British laundering. We have difficulty in getting the labour to meet our needs and the only effect of the tax will be to I&n crease our costs.\" CLEANERS' VIEW The National Federation of Dyers and Cleaners stressed last night that the Board accepted the view that price rises in the past two years were fair and reasonable. SET added a further 4 per cent. to costs. On the recommendation that there should be more price competition, the federation said: \" It is difficult to see how competition on prices could be more intense.",

   "text_content" : "The Board's inquiry into the costs of distributing coal and the prices charged to consumers follows Gov- ernment acceptance earlier this year of Coal Board proposals to raise the pithead price of domestic coals from November 1. It shows that costs of retail distri- bution have risen about 60 per cent. between 1958 and 1966, and SET adds further to the burden. The profit margin was not such that an increase of 20s a ton in pit- head prices this autumn could be absorbed, and the Board feels the coal trade would be justified under 3 the Prices Standstill in translating 3 SET into increased prices. Part of the coal distribution trade, according to the Board, entered in a new round of price rises in July, in many cases Immediately before the standstill announcement. Prices had gone up commonly by 5s and 8s 6d per ton, and in some instances by 10s and ls Sd per ton. Two main areas giving scope for reducing coal distribution costs could be defined-ensuring that coal was transported in fully loaded trains from the pits to recipients capable of receiving large quantities; concen- trating overheads through the rationalisation of ordering, collection and delivery by merchants as well as greater mechanisation in depots. Price increases -to which coal distribution would be entitled because of SET in the next 12 months should be abated to the extent that recent price increases were \"anticipatory.\" The Board also recommends that the Coal Merchants Federation should be invited to cooperate with the Government in ensuring that price rises by individual merchants in the 12 months standstill period took account of this qualification. Yesterday, Mr. Jack Charrington, the Federation's president, said merchants would do their utmost to comply with the Government's prices policy. However, the Federation believed that all or most of the price increases made before July 20 were on account of previous increases in costs which the merchants had been carrying. The Federation, he added, would consider the need 'for Increased rationalisation to reduce labour and raise productivity It was for the Natioqal Coal Board and tbe trade to takle the task jointly on a systematic basis, with inducoments offered to make amalgamations 1 attractive.",

   "text_content" : "BY OUR SCIENTIFIC EDITOR A MATERIAL challenging the widespread polyethylene film used everywhere to-day by farmers for protection against rain is made by BIP Reinforced Products, Streetley Works, Sutton Coldfield, Warwicks. It is Filon. This fabric is made of poly. ester. glass fibre and nylon. A shelter of it has been con- structed by Metal Agencies Company and used* by 'the National Vegetable Research Station as a mobile covering for land meant to be kept dry for comparison with irrigated land. As the temperature. and light must be interfered with as little as possible the shelter is only used during rain. Polyethylene film has been shown to be insufficiently durable for such a purpose, and glass is heavy and breakable. Many uses for this film are possible where durability is essential. Titanium Dioxide Translation and Technical In- formation Services, 6, Church End, Panfield, Braintree, Essex, has produced its third publica- tion: Titanium Dioxide Pro- duction. It is a useful biblio- graphy'of British and American patents going back in some instances to 1939 for date of application, though all pub- lished in 1964 and 1965. There are four sections- Production of the material by the chloride process, then by the sulphate process, pigment coatings and an index of patent numbers. Lubrication Discoveries Advanced research at the Lewis Research Centre of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Washington, D.C., 20546, has led to patent applications for a whole rtage of new materials for bearings, seals, cams and gears. The fundamental dis- covery is that metals given a henxaonal crystal structure are less likely to suffer when bear- ings fail. This is particularly possible in outer space, where the degree of vacuum allows automatic welding of materials touchipg each other. Robert L. Johnson and Donald H. Buckley are the chief scientists con- cerned. They have succeeded in alloy- ing titanium with. tin and aluminium, thus changing the hexagonal crystal din'rrnsions and making titanium. which is light and very strong and can withstand very high tempera- tures, into a go9 bearing material. Alloying cobalt with molyb- denum has allowed the former. which is hexagonal, to retain its qualities up to 1.300 deg F. BA. on Materials One .of the themes in the En- gineering and Chemistry sec- tions at the British Association meeting at Nottingham has been the 'importance of new materials in modern engineer- ing. As a result several papers were read and the Atomic Weapons .Rese(rch Establish- ment at Aldermaston mounted an exhibition. - Dr. A. E. Standage of .Rolls- Royce surveyed the fibre-rein- forced materials. He showed that polyitides produced at the National Physical Laboratory and reinforced by silica fibres are not only very strong' but will maintain their strength and other properties up to over 3753C. about 100*C better than .conventional aluminium alloys. His company has made a fibre- reinforced plastics material called Hyfal, which enables jet enginha of great power-to-weight ratWioo 'be made.

Dr. M. G. Barker described the properties of unusual alloys of alkali metals and gold or antimony having no metallic properties. Mr. D. Birchon of the Admiralty Materials Laboratory described the un- usual properties of a new cera- mic, silicon nitride. Professor D. D. Eley discussed the proper- ties of organic semi-conductors, while Dr. R. M. Dell outlined research on advanced nuclear fuels in carbides and nitrides of uranium and plutonium. Material shown by the Alder. maston scientists included zir. conium. hydride, usable as a moderator in specialised re- actors, cellular alumina for radomes. and polyurethane adhesives.

Imperial's direct- selling machines (from Castor of Italy) and Indesit of Turin though retailers have fully-auto- matic models at 79 and 72 gns. respectively. British competi- tion is more expensive. Since Hoover abandoned resale price maintenance, it has been pos- sible to buy its Keymatic for as little as 85 gns.--occaionally even less-but such bargains are not commonplace and more dealers sell at around 95 to 100 gns.

Thus they ac- counted for around a quarter of the business. 'with twin-tubs at 57 per cent. and wringer- attached types at about 17 to 18 per cent. In the first six months of this year. deliveries to the trade are between 17 and 18 per cent. lower-estimates are that the 1966 total will be no more than 650,000, if as much. Automatics have, how- ever, fared better with only a 6 per cent. fall in sales and deli- veries up to the end of July represented some 30 per cent. of all types of machine, with twin-tubs edging downwards and wringer machines more or less holding their own. This year automatics should wind up with sales of about 190.000 machines. or nearly so. Not that this means the out- look is particularly bright for any home laundry model, in- cluding the more popular automatic. For the hesitancy among dealers in placing autumn orders-li most firms these are anything from 10 to 20 per cent. down on last year -suggests that the consumer offtake has been far from buoyant in recent months and that stocks are mounting up. Even so. there is an atmo- sphere of stoicism-one could hardly call it optimism-in ome sectors of the industry. The hopes are based on past ex- perience that the more expen- sive appliances tend to fare less badly than the medium-priced lines during recessions. There is also the fact that less than a third of all families own laun- dry equipment, and a large number of machines must be falling due for replacement be- fore. long. The latter premise is likely to disappoint those who base their sales estimate on it. Boom-time for washing machines were the last two years before the Rolls demise, .1963 and 1964, and no other two years' figures have come near those totals. as our table shows. Certainly these machines will not be due for replacement 1until the end of this decade unless their owners tire of semi-automation and be- come converts to the sophisti- cated and versatile automatics. This might, indeed, have proved to be the case in better times but in credit-squeezed periods ' the teplacement market ts the Sirst to suffer. Appliance gape i tend to be filled even at the sac- Srice of other acquisitions. but r a machine that is still working, r however inadequately or even I inefficiently, tends to be kept in 1 service until finances improve. Another hope echoed here and there is that higher laundry costs necessitated by SET might prove some kind of stimulus. This, too, seems almost a for- lorn hope since launderettes and the like might benefit more than makers of home equipment.

   "article_dc_title" : "If the Reserves Diversification Fashion Catches on",
   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-08",
   "text_content" : "BY LOMBARD THB STBRLNO situation in general seen to look just a little more hopeful fance I deserted this colimnt to get away from it all last month. To judge by the behaviour of the currency markets, nervous. nead about the immediate outlook for the Â£'s parity has been waning rather than waxing. And the British authorities seem to have experienced no difficulty in proving that the Chancellor was justified in claiming that the reinforcement of the U.K.'s reserves arranged with foreign central banks in June was a \" continuing operation\" even though it did take the form of a package of three months credits. But one cloud that has been looming on the horizon for some time past has taken on a somewhat more ominous look. And since it could provide the nucleus of a storm that would be sizeable enough to rock the Â£ if it broke during the next year or so, it is certainly not too early to think in terms of working out suitable con. taining action. The cloud I have in mind con- cerns the desire of overseas mem- bers of the Â£ area to see a greater diversification of their reserves aimed primarily at reducing the present marked emphasis on ster- ling balances. And it has assumed f more worrying character because. just when many members of the family are almost certainly -more than usually concerned about the extent to which their reserves are implicated in the sterling drama, the Zambian Government has given them what is, from the British point of view, the wrong kind of lead. This is by announcing publicly that it is following a policy of building up the gold and dollar element in its reserves in order to make the sterling element look appreciably less weighty. Such switching is not. of course, entirely new. From time to time urping the put too y= 4f he U.K authoritie have indulged sterling are countries seeking a wider pread of their reserves by making arraagements for them to convert prt of their sterling holdings into gold or-more usually-into American dollars. But, except in the case of some Middle Eastern States that have found themselves in a position to press for particu- larly favourable treatment, it has almost invariably been possible to placate \"diversifers \" with rela- tively modest conversions. The rsult is that the pressure imposed on the central reserves of gold and convertible currencies in London by the diversification process has not up till now been a. 'major source of embarrassment to the U.K. Authorities. Zambia's Position Although all but about an eighth of Zambia's reserves of around Â£80m. are at present expressed in sterling, it is quite likely that switching by her into gold and other convertible curren- cies can also be kept down to rela- tively modest proportions-always provided, of course, her dissastis- faction with Britain's treatment of the Rhodesian problem does not reach the point *where political considerations take over. The country is. after all, receiving sinan- cial assistance from the U.K. on a considerable scale and it can be pointed out that the continuance of this flow could well be jeopar- dised if Zambia took a step that was calculated to add appreciably to Britain's externi payments embarrassments in a particularly vulnerable sector. Why the publicity Zambia has given to her intention to diversify her reserv is potentially dangerous is that it could provoke a series of demands from other sterling countries for the right to carry out similar conversions at a time when the bargaining power I of the British authorities in this i matter is much weaker than it has been in the past. Thus there can be no doubt whatsoever that sterling area countries as a whole are more worried at the moment than they ordidhrily are about the big sterling emphasis in their external reserves. The Australian Prime Minister. Mr. Holt, made no secret of his country's anxiety on this account in a public address in London a month or two back. And Australia has, of course, the area's largest sterling-based reserve. Yet, at the same time, the British Government's decision to impose restraints on the flow of capital to the more developed parts of the overseas sterling region means that the main quid pro quo t for keeping reserves in sterling rather than in other currencies has been much reduced in value for many countries in the area. There is the further point that members of the area that have hitherto lacked the courage to press the British authorities for permis- sion to reduce the sterling element in their reserves may be em- boldened to do so by Zambia's example. It is conceivable. too. that some will be encouraged to take such action sooner rather than later by the reflection that those who delay doing so until late in the day are far more likely to meet with resistance on account of the bareness of the cupboard than the early-comers. The official London balances of overseas sterling countries at pre- sent amount to not 50 very Unntc less than Â£2.000m. So it is not difB cult to see that, if diversificatibn became fashionable in only re* tively moderate degree in the immediate future, the effect could still be to present the U.K. 1tot- ties with a problem of s51bgtatdt It can, of course, he asuumeIthat the more responsible of thtbvwer- seas area countries are awarfe that the consequences for themselves could be so serious that i wodild not be in their true interests to follow the Zambian lead. But while it may be hoped that things will turn out this way, it woPld clearly be as well for the British authorities to consider now what action could be taken to contain a serious threat to the reserves from this direction. Enlist Fund's Aid One way in which the problem could be tackled would be by offer- ing to guarantee the dollar value of such part of their sterling re- serves as member countries felt' they could reasonably press to have diversified. Another and much better one would be to qnlist the aid of the IMF. For operations of the kind the Fund redently arranged to enable Italy to reduce the excessive dollar emphasis in her foreign currency holdings would be particularly suitable for use in connection with greater diversifica- tion of Â£ area countries reserves. Thus countries whose currencies were to be used in place of sterling could 'be called upon to lend suit- able quantities of them to the Fund. That institution could then make this money available to the U.K. for passing on to the Â£ area countries that were seeking to acquire it in exchange for excess sterling. In this way'the diversifi- cation fashion could be indulged with minimum dislocation of the international payments structure.",

   "text_content" : "YESTERDAY'S voting in Blackpool went much as ex- pected. The general motion of the TGOWU against incomes policy was rejected and the general, motion of the AEU in favour was accepted by equally large majorities. The issue that mattered, however, was the General Council's decision to support the Government's actual measures, and this was approved by a majority of only 344,000. Even a narrow victory is preferable to defeat, of course; the TUC and the Government can now continue to work together and the rebel leaders are in a much less strong position than they would have been if the figures had come out slightly different. But the figures themselves, which reflect the uncertainty and hesitation of the whole trade union move- ment, cannot give the Prime Minister any particular satisfac- tion. Iacomes debate It remains to be seen whether the rebels will carry on their fight against the wage freeze to the point of forcing the Govern- ment to assume powers of com- pulsion. The odds are that they will. But now that a majority has come out in favour of co- operating with the Government, they will have to watch their steps carefully. When everyone else has agreed to go without, the man who. insists on con- tinuing to grab is unlikely to remain popular-even if he were popular, which Mr. Cousins is not, to begin with. There is another, more im- pottant consideration, however, that they will have to keep in mind. The immediate wage freeze. is arbitrary and inequit- able. It provides an opportunity, nevertheless, for working out the criteria which are to regulate the growth of money incomes, and to keep the total in line with the growth of national pro- ductivity, when the freeze comes to an end. Unions which merely oppose the Government will thereby sacrifice their say in a debate which is bound to be of considerable interest to their members. The real difficulty will be, as it has always been, to reconcile the claims of fairness and efficiency. Some unions will almost certainly now press hard for the lion's share of the next increase in wages to go to lower- paid workers. We may see a campaign started for a national minimum wage, which politicians will find it difficult to oppose, though it leads straight on to the issue of equal pay. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the main economic need is to achieve higher pro- ductivity and that most union leaders now see the sense of relating productivity to wage claims wherever it can be im- proved. The Prices and Incomes Board is considering both pro. ductivity agreements and the position of low-paid workers and may come out' with a verdict formally acceptable to everyone. Productivity The real difficulty, however, will be to get any verdict accepted by the mass of indivi- duals with competing interests who make up the labour force. However unions may vote at Blackpool, it is the attitude of the individual worker that matters in the end-and his atti- tude not so much to a straight- forward temporary freeze, whose obvious unfairness can be swal- lowed in the national interest, as to a permanent arrangement for determining who is to get more pay and who is not. It would be a pity if discussion about this side of the policy were to crowd out discussion about the other side, where results satisfactory to everyone are probably easier to achieve. The growth of productivity and of incomes must be considered together, but it is in productivity that Britain has been weak and where a basic change in indus- trial attitudes is needed. determining who is to get more pay and who is n6t.

   "text_content" : "THERE ARE occasions when a straightforward rtatement of the obvious can be useful; there are times when it seems as if the National Board for Prices and Incomes considers itself to be a sort of official purveyor of such solemnities. Its two latest re* ports-one on laundry and dry; cleaning charges and the other. on coal distribution costs- contain very little that was not already known, or could easily have been assumed, about the industries concerned. But they present It all very neatly, in the brief space of 17 pages for coal and 26 for cleaning; this brevity, plus the omfcial seal, might serve to make the Industries concerned sit up and take notice. Transport costs The report on coal is the one with the least novel aspect. \"The main scope for reduction in rail transport costs,\" It says, \"is through ensuring thbat the coal is transported in fully loaded trains from the pits to recipients capable of receiving large quantities.\" The best ex. ample of this is the electricity generating industry, whose coal is increasingly being delivered In single trainloads running directly from the mines to the power stations. As a result the cost of transport from the pit. head has actually fallen durilh the last eight years, while the cost of transport to domestic consumers has risen, mainly be. cause the coal must be carried to many destinations from many mines and the trainloads marsNalled according to the timhonoured - and time. wasting - British Ralays te PlliB has kirted around tC question of whether or not lOry trafsport (at present hindered by the coal and railways Bords' restritve practices) might not a some itn a be cbear Instead It calls for more s1nly owned gcentratio depots, wnI the Naiiot Cal Vl an over he task of cotcen . an to tha extent that the 1tre tse raills to d o, It ca for lore M leantslon, ing, collection and delivery- and an extension of NCB re tailing if the Industry fails to reorganise itself according to this recipe. If these steps were taken the effect on the Industry would be admirable; what the PIB has done to further the taking of such steps is to say, with all authority, that they ought to be taken. The report on the laundry and dry-cleaning industries is more sophisticated. It, too, calls for amalgamations, the use of modern labour-saving equip. ment, and the rationalliatlon of delivery services In the declining laundry Industry; in the dry. cleaning industry, whose major problem is too many small factory-shops, the call is for more price competition to re. duce over-capacity. The dry cleaners, the report says, might be able to afford lower profits; the launderers could not.

In England and Wales the total area sown to cereals was up by some 300,000 acres or 4 ,per cent. as compared with last year, making a record total of 7.965m. acres. Barley, at 5,282m., is 630,000 acres higher, partly at the ex- pense of wheat and oats, down by 254,000 and 58,000 acres respec- tively. When the Scottish and Northern Ireland figures are added there should be a total United Kingdom acreage of well over 9m., and a potential grain crop of around 14m. tons, out of a total cereal usage of about 21.5m. The position is equally uncer- tain throughout Western Europe, and Continental forecasts of the harvest have been moving down- wards, especially for the French crops. Officially the French wheat estimate has been cut to 12m. tons, although some private experts are not looking for mor than ilm. tons, as against a 196 crop of well over 14m. In We! Germany, however, a slight! larger return is expected with wheat crop of 4.4m. metric ton Russia, too, expects a goo harvest, with between 70m. an BRITAIN'S GROWING HARVEST ('000 tons) 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 (at.)

For the home- position the )d best information is that the id harvest has finished along the South Coast, and in certain of the drier areas in Eastern Britain, but that elsewhere the picture is of 80 per cent. com- pleted in the South generally, to 50 per cent. in the Midlands and a good deal less in the North and inland parts of Scotland. Yield and quality are variable, yet possibly not as bad as was to have been expected from the wet and disease-ridden summer. The final result will depend entirely on the. weather during the next two or three weeks, and to illustrate. the frmers' con. tinue4 depeadend on the weathr . in spite of every mechanical and scientific aid. I cannot do btte.. than to set s down my owh expience. . . Wet Sumner This year my harvet consisted of 150 acres of winter wheat and 790 of spring barley, a total of 940 acres. Because of the wet summer ripening was delayed until mid-August, about a week later than normal, and when we started on the 17th the crop was only just ripe. We had a straight run of 12 days in glorious weather until the Bank holiday Saturday night. We did not work on that fine Sunday, foolishly as it turned out, for on the Monday we had nearly 3 inches of rain. During those 12 days we had harvested 750 acres, an average of 65 acres or roughly 100 tons of grain a day: during the next seven days we harvested 53 acres in two short spells between storms. The crops harvested in good weather contained between 14 and 19 per cent. moisture, C a . e e 8 C * making it simple and inexpensive to dry down to 14 per cent. for storage. That harvested after the rain contained between 24 and 30 per cent. moisture, needing slow drying at a high temperature. High temperature kills germi- nation, but much of this grain had already germinated in the damp conditions and so would have been useless for seed or malting (grain once sprouted will not do so again). In addi- tion the barley's golden skin of the week before had been turned to a dirty grey. It will make feed and nothing more. Because the barley was so ripe when the rain came the straw was brittle, and broke up in the storms, leaving many heads on the ground or hanging so low thiatthe combines could not reach them. So the machines are gathering some three or four hundredweight an acre less than they were before the rain, and this loss . gets progressively greater with every passing day. They were worked continuously through all mealtimes, and two of them, new machines, had no serious breakdowns at all; the third, in its fourth season, was out of action for about a day altogether. My experience illustrates the problem common to all- grain growers. which is how to get the maximum yield at an economjic cost in labour and machinery. The obvious answer would be to grow a succession of grain vari. eties that ripened at different times, and so spread the harvest period. Unripe grain stands bad weather much better than ripe- the straw is stronger and im. mature seeds do not sprout. There are barley varieties tha* ripen early, and it should be possible to plant a succession of crops that would in theory pro. vide such a harvest sequence. In practice I have found that this earliness does not amount to more than two or three days at most, and some of these early varieties do not suit my soils. One of John Cherrington's combines discharging grain Into a lorry for transportation to the drier. 0.- -. wress www r-1-0 --Y. -- -1ys ....1 ...Y uys s VÂ·se. Wheat, because of its stronger straw, is not quite so badly affected, 'but it sprouts very readily and will only be fitor feed, not milling . n terms cash the loss on barley harvested after the r'ain Is running between Â£5 and Â£10 an acre, or 12 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the value of the crop. Slow Speed It is obvious that if I had had enough combine strength to have done the job in ten days I would have been home and dry. In fact I had endogh capacity to do just that in a normal year, but 400 acres of barley were badly laid because of the wet summer and I was unable to run the machines at anything approaching their normal speed. As it was, I used three ooof the largest combines available, which represented an original investment of Â£10,000. In any case, early ripening is much more dependent on soil, climate and altitude. The earliest harvests in Britain are usually along the South .Coast near Chichester. about 60 miles from my farm, where they start at least a fortnight earlier than I do. Aiound Winchester, 20 miles away, it is a week sooner. The relative differences in alti- tude are 100 stet. 300 feet and& 600 feet above sea level. The relatively drier parts of Britain are often earlier, too, since excessive humidity extends the growth period and also makes the crops more vulnerable to diseases like rust in wheat, .and mildew and rhynco sporlum in barley. Rust has been par. ticularly bad in some varieties of Wheat this year. Generally it is true to say that crop yields are better in eastern Britain, and I think it is because the climate Continued on Page 16",

I am mostÂ· rateful to Mr. Grant for highlighting my main point, the ddiffresce between the organisation for crime preven- tion, for which there is at present no organisation, and that for post crime investigation which is essen- tially the responsibility of the Board of Trade and the Fruad Squad. Lex now says \"If he (Mr. Grant) rereads Sections 164 and 165 of the Companies Act 1948 he. will realise that an Investigation by the Board of Trade 'can be just as pro crime as any watchdog com- mittee.\" This may or may not be so (in practice it usually is not) but in any event it is not the point. A pro crime investigation is not what is wanted. In my recommendations, the role of the city panel (Watch- dog committee) Is primarily crime and loss prevention, not just investigation. The panel would, therefore, appoint directors, not inspectors, Inspectors AppolPted under Sections 164 and 165 have no authority to take executive action in preventing crime or further loss, but only to Investigate. Although their presence may In practice be Inhibitory, should they assume executive powers they might well find themselves open tc indefensible legal proceedings. Nes directors, on the other hand, acting for and responsible to all share holders, and working closely with those elements of the City who are most concerned, connected an\" interested can prevent further crime and loss of assets. The matter is complex and I ai prepared to enlarge on til mechanics of operation in due course, but I am sure the watchdog or Ombudsman approach is basic ally correct.

A Ministry of Labour spokesman confirmed last night that a letter had been sent to Vickers asking for the facts. - The recent increase conceded by Vickers, which in some cases amounted, it is believed, to about Â£1 a week, has caused trouble with clerks in the Vickers engineering Sard at Barrow. The pay rise has been debated by the local branch of the Clerical and Administrative .Workers Union, who reported the development to the Government. The. actual negotiations took place before the freeze but the Government is concerned that ahcording to the report reaching it the money was not paid out until well after July 20, the official start- Ing date for the freeze. In other cases such as the municipal bus workers where a rise was agreed and not paid the Government has ruled when it has been consulted that the increase should be delayed six months. The Vickers case could play an important part in determining whether or not the wage freeze is compulsorily enforced. It is under- stood that the money was not paid until after July 20 merely because of administrative and holiday reasons and in the opinion of local management this was legitimate.

A British Railways' statement said that at a meeting between rmanasement and union representatives, agreement had been reachd on all outstanding questions and the matter was now settled. INIDSTRIAL COURT RULES AGAINST PLASTICS FIRM The Industrial Court has ruled against a Surrey plastics company which claimed that if it was forced to comply with union agreements on pay and hours some of its employees would have their Â£30 a week wages cut by half, In its findings announced yester. day, the Court orders the company, Kingston Plastics of West Molesley, to comply with the agree- ments as from October 1, and says it is not satisfied that the terms and conditions which the company is observing are not less favourable than the recognised agreements. Kingston Plastics, is part of Lyndeau Group Products which Ina turn Is part of Airnx.",

   "text_content" : "By Our Political Correspondent The final talks between senior British and West German Ministers on our request for the foreign exchange costs of the Rhine Army to be met in full by the Germans are to take place shortly. Details of the meeting -will be discussed during the next few days and are expected to be announced next week. The most likely date is some time next month, after the officials on the Mixed Commission set up by the two Governments have completed their studies of the problem and submitted their report. The report is due by September 30. aue oy aeptemoer _iu. Although further meetings of officials are to take place-there is one in Bonn next Monday-the Government is not optimistic about their outcome. The Government's current assumption is that it will have to carry out its threat to press through the prescribed NATO and WEU procedures \" for cuts in the size of the Rhine Army. U.S. Suggestion The situation was reviewed ,yesterday by the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy Committee, resided over by the Prime ;inister. Among the matters dis. cussed were President Johnson's recent suggestion that there should be joint talks between Britain, the U.S. and Germany about our pro. posals for offsetting the Â£94m.-.a year exchange costs of BAOR. It is understood that British Ministers feel there would be little to be gained from tripartite talks, and that indeed these might well take the steam out of our current negotiations with Bonn. The Ameri- cans, on the other hand are reported to be objecting to Britain's haste. It also seems that the U.S. wants to reduce its own forces in Euroe and believes that this should be done at the same time a cuts are made In BAOR. The Cabinet committee probably also discussed to-day's meeting in Paris of the Annual Review Comr mittee of NATO, where our officials will be questioned about the formal notice delivered last month that Britain might have to withdraw some of its 59.000 troops in Germany. So far, Britain has produced only the barest of infor- mation to NATO on this subject, namely a \"hypothetical figure ' or Â£10m. a year which the Govern- ment would intend to save through withdrawing, troop. NATO has also been told that in addition to the savings on foreign exchange costs, Britain proposes to reduce the amount of stores and other \"logistic support\" carried by the Army. Here the Government is chal- lenging one of the basic assump- tions of NATO-that it must be ready to fight a conventional war lasting as long as 90 days. They believe the period should be drastically reduced, probably to about 10 days. The Government calculates that at least Â£20m. a year could be saved as a result of changes in the administration of BAOR, and the reductions in the amount of stores it carries. This is in addition to the Â£94m. a year which the Government is determined to save on foreign exchange costs,.",

   "text_content" : "y GB CYRIAX ONE OF th safest WmAll- sations in business is that largW orgaahsations can achieve economies dqnied to smaller ones-as long as \"cat\" in this context is not confused with \"do.\" Sometimes, as in the chemical industry, the benefits of site lie in the very large units of plant needed for efficient operation; when ICI announced its Â£30m. nylon polymer giant in Scotland in 1965, it was estimated that the costs per ton of producing. nylon at the proposed level of 70,000 tons a year would be nearly 20 per cent. less than in a plant of half the size. In engineering and building (thouph no longer in shi9 buildin) plant size is usualy less critical and it is the availa- bility of cash that tends to give the edge to large organisatlopa; Sneed for financal strength les al much behind theunlon grouping of engineers and oundryworkers as it does behind the mergers in madchine tools. And in the whole range of consumer industries from razor blades to soap, the cruaial advantage of size lies in the ability of large companies to launch a' national brand and to defend it with a level of pro- motion expenditures ; that smaller companies cannot match. It is the cost of adver- tisina. and not the auality of blades, that is testing Wilkinson in its battle with Gillette. Not Materialised What is worrying, however, is how frequently these advatages. of size fail to materiale in practice. The TUC provides an extreme case in point. Since the 1920's, there have been regular calls for more union amalgamations in order to secure a more logical bargain- ing structure and to minimise disputes between unions; Mr. Woodcock renewed this appeal for larger unions in 1963. Yet amalgamations have been slow -there are still over 600 U.K. unions, compared with 16 in Germany-and, when achieved, unconvincing in their results. Thus the bringing together of printing unions under the leadership of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation has done nothing to alter the fact that bargaining power lies with the individual chapels who pur- sue their craft interests-as at the Belfast and Southwark works of the International Pub- lishing Corporation - against other members of the Federa- tion and even other chapels of the same union; similarly, the main effect of union amalgama- tions in the shipyards has been to transfer demarcation dis- n0te fro0otutside.to inside the oilermakers* Society. Nor. can the Iargest union be said to be moare e:wim in *ther burgai- ing actvties than the rest. SIs the poor showing f ithe major unions ind2ates tie weakness of being big n nuni- ben but not control, the same could be said of some of the largest U.K. companies, at least in modified form. The problem has been at its most acute in engineering groups such as Vickes and :AEI. n both companies, the problem has not only been that capital haa. been spread over such diverse interests-ships and en- gines, pumps, office equipment, armaments. nuclear engineering. printing mabines , chemical engineering and the whole range of steel output for Vickers; domestio appliances, cables, electronic equipment ;and the whole range Of heavy power plant for ABI: in each division (say. trnsformers o;. ships), production has been carried on a craft basis in a numbet of works, so that even at this level, size of output is a deceptive in- dicator of the economies of scale being reaptd. Much the same co\"binrti of size with- out ecopbntot ari4s typical of the large cotton amalgamations, such a Lancahire Cotton, be- fore:d `t binsl P<Courtaulds and ICL Nor, on the figures, is this uhtpile), If the benefits of size were being 8generml9 r cd in com- pauty pr fitabily, one would expect tit thi rdtdrns On capital employed in ery large com- panies-sayt $7JK,1,'s top 100 -would\" be'signifcantly above the aveiage for all quoted U.K. companies. In fact, taking net income as a percentage of net assets, there is no sign over the past 10 years that large com- panies have earned above the average. This is a fact to be pondered. The same problem should concern the Government and Mr. Michael Stewart at the De- partment of Economic Affairs, since the public sector is another area where large size achieves little in terms of economies of scale. The public 'sector, which since 1961 has been growing twice as fast as the economy as a whole, now absorbs over 30 per cent. of national resources; this includes 50 per cent. of the U.K.'s construction output and a far higher proportion of power equipment and electronic equipment for defence. One of the best concepts in the National Plan-and one quite independent of the drive for a higher growth rate-was that the Government should broaden its control of the pub- lic sector by making use of its sizew tb prmote co-ordla* ted buying, tAdadisatioa sad longer runs. The results ave eezape In construction ax Ineentives for industrialised bildig havebeent largely nega- tived by the local authorites who have continued their, on- off ordering for houseo' the drive for standardisation has come;\"jUp aits the autouomy of the ftk=iIUe ndustrs; and thre has. been wthSg app rachlng * McNamna breakthrough in procurepent for 4*spce Mr. Michael Stewart These ,bm examples show how esl for an organisa- tion in business to be large on paper and achieve no economies of scale, and the reason is quite simply that the organisations- unions, companies, Government departments-are not large in any meaningful sense. For companies the relevant test of size is whether they are large' in their market, as with Rolls. Royce and Butlin's, rather than . large overall; if this same criterion was applied to the unions, the steelworkers and draughtsmen might be found to be reaping more economies of scale than the 1.5m. Transport and General Workers. In the public sector, realising the potential economies of scale in the way envisaged in the National Plan could only come through effective central co- ordination of the departments and the nationalised industries by the Treasury, on a pattern not dissimilar-though neces- sarily more complex-to that in a very large holding company. A real attempt at control along holding company lines was started with the 1961 White Paper on the Financial Obliga- tions of the Nationalised Indus- tries under which, for the first time, the Treasury began to act less as bank manager and more as controller of the various chai Post Office, Elec- I tricity Council, etc.-by whom it was approached for money. Labour has not developed this y arrangement, however, Ibr Â· M * the bulk of Governmntwi. tions that affect i Treasury control con4t operate less in the utglm e sense than in the form of t traditional war on waste. Although \" waste\" is cev- tainly one of the major dir economies of scale, an effective war on it in private industry needs to be far more discrimin ating than, say, the Tre normal pruning operat 10 per cent.

It is the luxury of carrying unprofitable activities, rather than any per- sonal extravagance or over-in- vestment, which is the main area of waste in large U.K. businesses, and which has con- sistently pulled down the re- turns in such companies as Vickers (ships) and Tube Invest- ments (aluminium). Profit-earners A regular programme of this sort is. however, only half the problem of realising economies of scale; the other half is fin- ing and marketing the profit- earners. and it is. ere that the large organisation, given effec- tive control from the top, is outstandingly well-placed. With money, skilled personnel and the proper size of plant, the large company can launch any new venture on an effective scale; the only thing it cannot do is force the customer to buy. The control problem thus boils down to a selection system for new ventures which turns out to be more profitable than a random choice. This imight not sound a very demanding target, given the number of techniques designed exactly to this end. But that would -be a misunderstanding. For nearly all such techniques come into operation only after the key decisions at board level- whether to buy a new company, when to erect the new mill- have been taken. Realising the potential for profitability in a large organisa- tion thus requires method and the personality to influence Board decisions towards the profitable alternatives and, of the two, it is probable that strength of personality will play the larger part in determining whether profitable decisions are really made. t Â·, ,,"

Gamage, alth6ugh the fonmer has had quite a good first half. And Court Brs. (Parnhdrs), while., again reporiing higher profits, ba aot gone ahead as strongly as -in previous years. Frota the heavy side of industry Stetaty returns lower profits and Mres warns that the next divi- dead may be lower (see Lex, Page 1). On a brighter note, Dir s has done well and*oldd have paid more but for the fsandstill. Court Bros. 6wce agtii the results of Cort Br14m11 (VwM bsimu) show in- creaed profits--but growth has slowed markedly. The shares fell 10%d to 15s 6d following the an- .noqcement yesterday. Against rise. of iiround a quarter in each of the past two years the 1965-66 advance is only from Â£794,000 to Â£2 or 4.9 per cent. And Swhen adustments for a lower in- crease, o 168,400 against Â£94,600 in the provision for unearned hire-purchase profits reserve are made, the true profits increase falls to Â£12,500, or 1.4 per cent. Still, earnings are 40.2 per cent. leaving tIie maintained 20 per cent. dividend covered twice. The trouble may be margins. The rise in the unearned profit reserve shows tnit credit business has grown, although at a slower rate, while two new:outlets in 1964-65 and two. in 1965-66 should have made sOmne useful contribution. For the current year much will depend on Court's ability to hold margins, but with two-thirds of sales on hire-purchase demand might not be firm enough to out- weigh the bigger overheads. How- ever, Court has shown its capa- bilities in the past and the 6.6 per cent. yield and 7.5 P/E ratio pro- vides reasonably. firm ground under the share price. Drury Holdings Better figures from Drury Hold- laos were not unexpected for the January interim statement predic- ted that this would be the case. In the event there is a rise of over 13 per cent. to Â£681,000 in pre-tax profits. What perhaps is more im- portant, particularly as this group is engaged in housing estate development and building contract- ing, is that the volume of work on hand at present is a record; and profits in the current year to date -some five months have now passed-are in excess of the corresponding period of last year. The knowledge that the total divi- dend is restricted to 40 per cent. instead of 45 per cent. supports an optimistic view of the immedi- ate future. There are of course two points to remember; first that weather conditions in the latter half of the year can play an important part in the final outcome and secondly in- creased costs will keep up the pres- sure on margins. Drury's ability to keep moving forward in these hard times is probably due to its close contacts with tuilding societies and the policy of linking Mlortge arrangements to an ear at-a of construction. Suece of t s type of planning has been fleted one or to building company re- suits recently. Drurys 5 Ordinary shares were called Is 6d higher at 33s 6d yesterday following the announcement to yield 6.1 per cent. and sell at 6.8 times earniang. James Howden The results fromlJames Hewdea are not up to earlier hopes with preitax profits down 12 per cent at Â£1.om.. But the dividend Ki maintained at 28Y per M,., if thinly covered by earnno 3.7 per cent. Reasons for setback are not hard to find and on present form they seems unllail to be repeated in the curent yAr. Apart from rising costsi bhote. aggravated by a shortage pftlled labour. Howden operating.. as specialists in air and gas handling plant suffered a disappointing year in Canada. This was lagely due to the nature of the businees; order books were full and capacity doubled but contracts were a long-term basis-three rour years, etc.-and profits took longer than expected to work through, while at the same time overheads continued to rise. On, the U.K. side new plant is now in operation, labour problems, have eased, and steps have been taken to improve efficiency and keep margins under control. Order books are full- with the C.E.Q.B. the main customer-and 1966-67 is going well so far. Last February's Â£1 %m. debenture issue helped the group through its difficult patch without recourse to bank borrow- ing, although interest charges have more than doubled. pown 3d to 23s on the day the 5s Ordinary shares yield 6.3 per cent. Western Dooars The dangers of taking an opti- mistic view in Plantation markets are underlined by the disappointing results from Western Doars Tea Holdings. Earlier this year the shares were as high as 18s 3d. but on the basis of the latest results yesterday's price of 14s 3d looks igh enough. Pre-tax profits have fallen from Â£304,000 to Â£259,000 and the dividend is cut by two points to 9 per cent. The trouble was that although prices were about Id per pound better, the Crop was 1% Y per cent. down and costs rose by about l1%d per pound. This is disappointing enough, but it also appears that overspill relief has amounted to less than seemed likely-resulting in the reduced dividend. However, it is hoped that over- spill may be greater this year, which might mean the restoration of the 11 per cent. dividend. But it would be unwise to count on any such move and the intricacies of the group's overspill position are best left to the forthcoming chair- man's statement. Judging purely by tea prospects, the outlook is not particularly encouraging, for crops were only level-pegging at the half- season in mid-August and prices have been lower-although sales of the new season's, crop opened on a better note. At 13.6 per cent., the yield is by no means generous.",

Douglas (Contractors) for a number of years, has, by reason of the group's expanding activities in many sections of the construe. ion Industry,. been \" tull fnstfied\" bhv reaslts. Chairman Mr. R. M. Pouglas says that the Board will make very endeavour to ensure that future expansion is maintained at steady rate in appropriate relation to the increasing size and importance or the group. Group turnover, and trading profit up from Â£1,156,941 to Â£1,301,425, were both records in the year to March 31, 1966-a year when many problems had to be faced. Trading costs as a whole were rising, including the considerable in- creased charges imposed by Govern- ment measures or industrial agree- ment-which alone cost the group approximately Â£100,000 during the year. Members are told that forecasting future results with any degree of con- fidence is \" never an easy matter \" as profitability of the construction in- dustry is always \" most sensitive\" to decisions of Government and, having regard to the prevailing economic climate, may be even more vulnerable in the immediate future. Profit Analysis Of the 1965/66 trading profit, 45 per cent. is attributable to con- tracting activities, 45 per cent. to ales ad hMr of equipment (of whih abut '35 per cent. was overseas) the balance being derived from the sand, gravel, ready-mixed concrete interests and investment income. As stated on August '20. pre-tax Chairman's st profits were up from Â£768,012 to Â£899.784, and the dividend is repeated at 20 per cent. On the building and civil engineer- ing side, Mr. Douglas says following restrictive measures introduced in July, 1965, opportunities of tender- ing for major schemes 'were con- siderably restricted but a substantial volume of work is still. ahead and the opportunities to tender. currently being extended to the contracting subsidiary are \"encouraging.\" Having regard to the long-tera fixed price contracts in hand, the company had to bear throughout the year the full impact of inflationary trends and additional costs cons. =uent upon labour and material shortages. The Australian subsidiary had its best ever results in the year to June 30. 1965. but the Australian economy has more recentry become depressed and preliminary figures indicate that in the year just ended turnover is slightly below 196465 and margins have been somewhat reduced due to increased costs.

   "text_content" : "THrETib bd w but clear w and the priniipl f fr ment to back te w system on wage cais The gress supported by oflt 344,0Y 0 votes the general statement of 'i leaders on the future path for the incomes policy. Perhaps the most notable feature of the debate was the speech of Mr. Victor Feather, TUC assistant 4 general secretary. His exposition of the TUC's pight, and the roa that had led the TUC to acquiesce reluctantly in the incomes stand- still, was widely applauded. Mr. Feather was deputising for Mr. George Woodcock, TUC general secretary, who is still recovering from llness. Fear of High Unemployment Presenting the General Council's report on economic policy, Mr. Feather said the General Council had to reckon with the possibility that unemployment might rise far beyond what the Government cal- culated its Yuly measures would produce. Of the recently passed Prices and Incomes Act sHe said: \"The General Council do not believe that this is so monstrous an imn t position that the whole trade union movement should be called on to rise in a revolt.\" Mr. Feather, who spoke for just over half an hour. received en- couraging cheers. There was not a discordant note and at the end he received a prolonged and warm ovation. Asked to Accept Responsibility He began by saying that the way Congress would vote was important. But what unions did later in the light of the decision taken was even more important. They were being asked to accept the responsibilities that must accom- a ny authority and maturity in the knowledge that failure to do so would compel the Government to act on its own. Though 'our economnic problems were serious and complex Britain was not a bankrupt nation Her economic potential was enormous. Delegates knew that the industries and services in which they. worked were capAble of advancing far more rapidly than ever before. The critics of the General Council would talk in terms of reducing Britain's external commitments. But the Government had gone further than any of its predecessors in tackling U.K. balance of payments problems directly itjhat *ay. -New Approach' I Required Also. the General Council believed that the Government could go further in that direction. It was more likely to listen to them if congress had something tangible to offer besides good Ndvice. S\"We need a new overall a proach based on changes in external policy as well as domestic policy. The world is in desperate need of a new international monetary system do signed to provide a basis for expand- rig world trade and for taking the pressure off the reserve currencies- the pound and the dollar. \"The Government is actively .searching for such a new system but the will be asked what they intend o otribute and Britain's view point \"it ol ely to get a propaer erlns it I aseen that we are putting our own hose in order.\" Mr. Peather asked who would in and who would lose if the overnment reversed its pol cles. The odds were there would be massive unemployment, or If Inflati on con. u s n low fixed Income nd prac rising and their living standards eroded.

As sass. on tat aMre wus not one of principle u o lim, A run an arllng wuld for no man and for Victor Feather-\" We do not believe this is so monstrous that the whole trade union movement should rise in revolt.\" no Government and whether it liked it or not the Government had to act quickly on theb immediate problems. The General Council had its reservations about what the Govern- ment did, and before July 20 was telling the Chancellor of the Exchequer about them. The July ligures of un mployment, output, investment and new orders bore out what they had said. The situation this winter and next year was going to need very careful handling indeed. The General Council believed that action should still be taken on the rise in imports, private investment abroad, Government spending over- seas and particularly spending on defence. . From the beginning, the General Council knew that the Government's intentions would check output and cause unemployment. The General Council's decisions we. not take n lightly or quickly. In the end were wr faced with n explicit choice a tandstu on prices and incomes &d unemploy ment fr some of our people for some of the te between one job and another, or the prospect of un- employment for a, lot of our people for a lot of their time.\" They would har in the debate aw good deal abow' things the Govern- ment had not done, but it had not attacked the social service, or put back prescription charges, or slashed the housing programme, or attacked the educat onal system. They recognised, as this congress would have to recognise, that the Government had made up its mind. The signs of success that were beginning to show in the middle of the year in the TUC's voluntary policy were not enough for the Government to whom an incomes policy was something which produced quick results to impress sceptical foreign creditors. Some Sort. of Policy Needed The General Council was still con- vinced that some sort of incomes policy was going to be necessary, and however great the difficulties created by the standstill and the period of severe restraint the voluntary notifica- tion system would be kept going. Its defects they recognised and must try to put them right if only because the summer of 967 might well bring an avalanche of pay claims and price increases that could wipe out whatever was gained by the stand- still and leave the situation worse than ever. On one issue there was no disagree- ment between the Government and the TUC. Whatever might be toler- able in a period of emergency there was no future for any incomes policy that depended exclusively on the Government's power to impose legal sanctions on reluctant trade unionists and employers. \"The General Council accept HOW lJm SWENT ': ..

The doctrine of every industry for itself i began to go when we first committed ourselves to'economic planning. \"Are we still stuck with the idea of every union for itself or every factory for Itself, or every grade for itself, or are we genuinely a congress, a move. ment? No trade union can now i operate in isolation: discharging its I responsibilities to its own members i without regard for its responsibilities to the movement as a whole and to the nation.\"",

More trouble, between Rhodesia and Zambia has developed from Mr. Wrathall, the new Deputy Premier. thd week-end incident in which a Zambian immigration official was arrested on Rhodesian territory for being \"drunk and disorderly\" by Rhodesian police. -As a result Zambia has banned 'Rhodesian immigration officials from crossing into Zambia, which may mean delays andinconvenience for rail travellers. for rail travellers. -LEE By Ou Foeonig Wta A VIEITOON-TYPE operation as the quicket way to solve the Rhodesian problem was proposed last night by Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, in an interview on BBC television. \"If you can get ;black Rho- desians to constittite a Vietcong- say two battalions roaming around Rhodesia and others under training -elsewhere-the problem would be solved quite quickly. The issue is quite simple., Mr. Lee went on to make. the remarkable assertion that he was * not a moderate, nor an extremist. He was, he claimed, a realist. Barlier in the day Mr. Lee had called for the limited use of force to increase and enforce the sanc- tions campaign against Rhodesia. Speaking to the Press after the second session of the Common- wealth Prime Ministers' conference, he said4 that he had put two suga gestions to the Prime Ministers.' The first was that Britain take \"the issue a big step further, namely more effective sanctions over a wider range, not just oil, and backed by force in ensuring that the sanctions are not broken. Air and sea power Britain should use air and sea power to operate a wider range of sanctions, he said. as in the case of the Beira blockade. Such a use of force he found morally defensible. although direct \"eyeball to eyeball\" combat between British and Rhode- sian troops \"is, of course, unthink- able.\" This was his first suggestion to the Conference. The second was that the African members should make a demonstration of their feelings \"by some dramatic gesture.\" They could either walk out of the Conference. or they could \"write it off.\" Mr. Keith Holyoake, Prime Minister of New Zealand. told the Conference he rejected the use of military force because it was such an uncertain instrument. Some delegates evidently thought that Britain should impose a period of direct rule before granting independence with a majority Government. This might sound all right in isolation but it could entail a declarationah of war on the Smith regime which could result in a blood- bath over most of Southern Africa. PORTUGAL'S IMPORTS SHRINK From Our Own Correspondent LISBON, Sept. 7. PORTUGOAL'S imports from Rhodetia fell dramatically during the first six months of this year .to. approximately 1l3m. escudos, :com- pared with 49m. escudos during the corresponding period of last year. The fall was mainly due to the fact that whereas last year almost 30m. escudos worth of unwrought copper was imported by metro. politan Portugal from Rhodesia none was purchased during the January-June period of this year. Instead, doubtless as a result of Portugal's policy of appeasing Zambia and of trading with all her African neighbours normally des- pite sanctions, .37m. escudos worth of c pper was Imported from that country.' Poftuguess Imports of unmanu- factured tobacco during the period were halved to a value of 6m. escudos, while those of bides fell away fionm Sm. to Im. escudos. Imports of Rhodesian beef, nil last year, were valued at 2m. escudos during the first six months of this year,",

Two very distinct reactions to Dr. Verwoerd's assassination are apparent here. On the one hand. many Rho. desians. feel a genuine sense of sad- ness and loss at Dr. Verwoerd's death. For many, South Africa has been Rhodesia's saviour in recent months and this has made the death of its respected Premier seem almost a personal tragedy. On the other band, there jp cer- tainly a sense of apprehension and foreboding as a result of the assas- sination. Some observers believe -the advent of Mr. Vorster might mean demands that Rhodesia should follow South Africa in declaring a Republic and implementing a full-scale policy of apartheid. There are certainly some who would welcome this and believe that with Mr. Vorster as Premier South Africa would soon recognise Rhodesia officially. But another group believes more moderate South African leadership might emerge-along Donges lines- which might become increasingly caitious about aid to Rhodesia in defiance of world opinion. But this course seems highly un- likely and most Rhodesians appear to expect that Rhodesian-South African relationships will be un. affected by the tragedy.",

   "paper_dc_date" : "1966-09-08",
   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN 'TWELVE MONTHS AGO Lord Zferby's Go Shell won the Port- taid-Handicap at Doncaster at odds of 100 to 7, and this four- year-old colt by Ennis may stage .a- repeat performance in the race this afternoon, though the starting -price is unlikely to be as generous as it was then. In his early races this year Go Shell was disappointing, and as recently as July 13 he was tailed off behind Showoff,. Dunme and Creole in the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket. But on his next, and most. recent appearance, in the HUngerford Stakes at Newbury on Au'gust 12, he was significantly backed from 10 to I down to 6 to I to beat Silly Season at a difference of a stone, and though he finished just out of a place behind ,Mr. Paul Mellon's good colt, he was in the lead for six furlongs, and at that stage of the race looked extremely dangerous. On that form, he is fairly handi- capped to-day with 8 st 12 lbs. Mileslus, who appears to have benefited from a change of scenery -he was bought out of Capt. C. Boyd-Rochfort a stable by G. Boyd, the Scottish trainer, for 19.000 guineas, at last year's Newmarket Autumn Sales-may go close t1 winning with only 7 at 12 lbs. The winner of the September Maiden Stakes (2.40) for two-year. olds, run over seven furlongs, is likely to come from a group of th 'G old Marine, a colt by Sodlum'i St. L Hard Ridden trained by P. J. Prendergast, who was gambled on at the Curragh last month, but who was beaten by House Proud; Pally's Double, a full brother to the good handicapper, Pally; and French Vine, a colt by French Beige. trained by W. Elsey, who ran promisingly in his only race to date, at Ripon, last week. Gold Marine will no doubt start hot favourite and probably he will win; but it may be worth having a \" saver\" on French Vine who, I am assured, has the makings of a useful animal. Provided he does not get worked up during the preliminaries, Le Jordonnier looks certain to win the Scarbrough Stakes (3.50) for he is of better class thast his opponents. However. for the best bet on to- day's card I turn to Abbeyfield, a filly by Abernant, in the Princess Mary Nursery Handicap (4.20), whom N. Murless trains for Mrs. Sibell Beatty. Abbeyfleld has run twice; first at Newmarket in July. when she Thowed good speed behind First Date and Candida Gold, and next when winning a maiden race at Newbury ten days later. Barkhan, who was \"stood down\" in favour of his stable companion, Pwaco, for a valuable sponsored race at last Saturday's Variety Club meeting at Sandown, is a useful stayer in his own right, and repre- sents a sound bet in the Alexandra Handicap (4.50). ra r-Pase 22",

The expertise of Britain's wool and allied industry could help to keep it ahead of foreign competi- torn, -a textile scientist said at Bradford to-dyy.; Dr. P. P. Townend of the De partment of Textile Industries, Leeds' University, said that the future tiend towards shortening, speeding up and automising pro- cesses would -not be enough to meet tle future challenge from qverseas as more and more coun- tries were able to make con- ventional textiles. Addressing a national conference of trainees in the wool, jute and lax Industries. Dr. Townend said the British industry needed to retain and develop its expertise for process ins and manufacturing finer and difflcult fibres which other countries were not able to do and for blending fibres to give superior handle, style and finish. It should put more colour into fabrics. Future developmients could lead to mills operating in shifts round the clock, to major reorganisation in machine lay-out and to mergers into larger units in the industry.",

   "text_content" : "INTERIM STATEMENTS KEIZER VENESTA LIMITED (Britaln's leading Importers and distributors of plywood and Europe's largest manufacturers of plywood containers) - IMT IM RE DDIDT __ for the lix months to 30th June 1966 The Directors have declared a second Interim Dividend of 2% for the year ending 31st December 1966 which with the , 5% first Interim paid on 4th April makes a total similar to that paid on Ist October a year ago, namely 7%. The dividend will be payable on Ist October 1966 to shareholders whose names are registered in the books of the Company on 14th September 1966. Sales and profits for the half year ended 30th June 1966 were as follows: Six months Six months Six months 30th June 30th June 31st December 1966 1965 1965 Sales ............... Â£6.085,000 Â£6,040.000 Â£5,708,000 Profits before tax .Â£263.000 Â£290,000 Â£245,000 During the early part of the year sales were encouraging, as reported at the A.G.M. on 4th April, they showed an increase of about 40%. Political influence caused a slowing down during the month of June which has continued. H6w- ever, it is difficult to make a true comparison of sales as during the first 31 months of 1965 the Temporary Charge on Imports was 15% whereas it has remained at 10% throughout the year under review. The removal of T.C.I. on 30th November will be a relief, as we calculate that we have tied up in stock and debtors on account of T.C.I. close on Â£250,000. The saving in interest charges on this and other moves we have made will be substantial and will offset the additional burden of Selective Employment Tax. Undeclared profit held against the reduc- tion of T.C.I. remains at Â£111,000 which should be more than ample to cover any actual loss on impotted stocks. Share- holders are again reminded that the prices of plywood and allied products in which the Company trade have remained remarkably stable for several years. The No-Nail Group of Companies has had an exception- ally difficult half year due to acute shortage of skilled labour in North Wales. The plants have been operating rather below full productive capacity and earlier expansion hopes have been frustrated. These factors and the credit squeeze have resulted in about 100% reduction of trading profits and the percentage of total profits contributed by manufacture is therefore reduced from 28% to approximately 24%. It seems probable that the construction and building indus- tries. furniture manufacture and many more consumer industries will be adversely affected by the Government's policies during the remainder of our trading year. all of which suggest diminution of demand for this Company's products. However our business is buoyant and we lose no oppor- tunity. both in our trading and manufacturing companies, to exploit every possibility for expansion of our sales. These policies and planned integration of the companies in our Group, all of which make good progress. suggest that our results for the year 1966 will-not be unsatisfactory. Further.than that it would be imprudent to go in view of the political uncertainties of the contemporary economic and financial scene. Liverpool. 7th September 1966. LEX GARAGES LIMITED Lex Garages Limited announce that, subject to audit, the half-yearly pre-tax profit to 30thi Juno last amounts to Â£258,000 against Â£191,000 for the corresponding period in 1965. The increase is attributable to better trading in the period,.the reduction in the import sur- charge rate from 15% to 10%. and a general stream* lining of the Group's operations. r; __ TRA ILEII COMPANY LIMITED It is a pleasure to set before you now the first Interim Statement of our Cdmpany since the Public Issue of Shares in April last.

   "text_content" : "This year's vocal'recitalists are a distinuished quartet: Schwarakopf Frit Wundecrich, to-mqrrow Janet Baker and yesterday, Evelyn Lear. Miss Lear, as readers may remem- ber, is a favourite of this page, and one of the most versatile, intelli- gent and attractive singers of our day. Her range is from Mozart to Schreker, Berg and beyond; lucky the modemrn composer who secures her for his new opera, among the most lustrous of her many gleam- ing performances was as the heroine of Egk's Beirothal in San Domingo. She is not a classical singer. The' tone is not a pure, even chime. The technique is not totally solid, the line not a thread of matched pearls but rather a cluster of jewels with darker radiance-and admit. tedly some of them may be flawed. The timbre is warm, personal, and kindles into sudden glory. All this is of a piece with the inter- pretation. Miss Lear's starting point, it would seem, is never any abstract stylistic consideration, but first an epsotional probe into what- ever she is singng, imaginative identification with the role, the poem, the musical character. Emotion is then controlled by intelligence, and expression I matched to her wide range ol F technique, which may sound rathet t seliconscious-but in fact her per' formances are direct, vivid, and strongly positive in character. II I is this directness which makes hot * Pamina so vigorous, her Elvira s r affecting. When we add that heo ) personality is so attractive that she r can win an audience before a note i has been sung; that she moves with : grace and eloquence; that she is a very attractive woman, and a passionate actress-then it is plain why Miss' Lear is a favourite. The Freemasons' Hall is not an , easy place to sing in, especially when it is less than full Then the acoustic is hard, clangorous, like an over-close gramophone record- ing. There were several passages in Wednesday morning's recital which sounded less than comfortable, when a smaller dynamic range would have been more effective, 1 Miss Lear sang Schumann, Berg, Wolf and Richard Strauss. The I glowing. romantic beauty of Berg's ' Seven Early Songs, and Strauss's * stark, terse Ophelia fragments (perhaps the most \"modem \" ol all his songs) were both outstand, ing. In two of them, however, a sonj / failed to find its natural gait: i rhythm became too impulsive, anc basic tempo was insufficiCntly established. For Mis Lear's handling of lieder is not altogether secure. Her expression sometimes breaks the narrow frame. \" Na- mersatte Liebe,\" for example, was filled with delightful and interest- ing nuance, but the simplicity of the basic line beneath the rich surface detail had been lost. Strauss's \" Ich wolit ein Strtusalein binden,\" composed for Elisabeth Schumann, contains filigree which Miss Lear could not trace flexibly enough; her voice is not silvery, but ricily patinated. It shone an \"An die NachL\" It was not a recital of classic perfection, but memorable for its warmth, and its richness of feeling. Irwin Gape was the rather solid accompanist. The acoustics did not help him; in this hall one seemed to want a lighter, smaller piano. Prince of Wales Johnny Mathis entertains by B. A. YOUNG He entertains in the now traditional way, by breathing bal- lads into a microphone to which he is attached by an invisible umbilical cord. He has a curious stance with his knees slightly bent, and the only evidence he ever gives of being possessed by the emotion of his songs is to stand on one leg and flex the other to and fro as if he were about to kick a football. I found him a singularly pleasant young man, and his choice of smooth, sentimental ballads is unexceptionable. He has an unusually modest demeanour which is, no doubt unconsciously, demonstrated through his use of the mike. The further he gets away from it and uses his real voice, the better he sounds; when be is in his most frequent position, that is to say with his mouth three inches from the mike, he might be any one of half a dozen of his imitators. Also in this intimate phase he habitually sings up to half a tone flat, which he never does when he lets himself go. He is supported by a rather un- exciting vocal sextet called Our Younger Generation, though I should be surprised if their average age were much less than Mr. Mathis's; and he and/or they are on stage all the evening. I empha- sise this because managements have a way of announcing one-man shows and then restricting their stars to one long spot in the second half, so that the hard-working fillers-up of the rest of the time are lucky not to get the bird. Mr. Mathis sings 37 songs, sometimes in truncated versions; and Our Younger Generation support him in most of them and also sing half a dozen numbers of their own. The show lasts a bit under two hours.",

   "text_content" : "It is difficult to know quite how to approach Beatrix, Festival Ballet's summer novelty, though at a time when the Kirov are showing us the high peaks of the dancer's art, Beatrix can only look all the more opportunist and trumpery. Even as a danced operetta, which it most resembles, it is not particu- larly good of its kind; the heart of the work, the triumph of true love, is cheated by making the denouement a dream, and the sur- rounding activity of divertissements and corps de ballet cavortings can hardly bring the work to any sort of success. Were it more seriously a period pastiche, and considerably pruned as to the fringe activities of the cast, something more heart- touching might have emerged, but in its present form the most 'powerful of dramatic performances from its principals are needed to give it any emotional force. But Festival Ballet's presentation fails in just this respect, and though I found last night's changes of cast preferable to the opening night interpretations, the breath of theatrical life was rarely present. Carmen Mathd and Alain Dubreuil gave neat renderings as Beatrix and Benedict, Miss Math6 more tender, Mr. Dubreuil more winning than their predecessors, but only Andr6 Prokovsky as the Marquis sug- gested something of the bravura really needed, and this in technical rather than dramatic terms, by his multitudinous pirouettes and clean, high-placed batterie. The really interesting question about Beatrix, though, is the direc- tion in which it is leading Festival Ballet as a company, and the kind of audience it attracts and in- fluences. The answer presumably lies in the box-office, but whether it is the right one is a different matter altogether. Shaw double bill at Mermaid Heading the cast of the Shaw double-bill, which opens on Sep- tember 14 at the Mermaid Theatre, are lan McKellen, Marie Kean and Sian Phillips.

   "text_content" : "The Sun King, by Nancy Mitford; Hamish Hamilton; 63s. One hopes that Miss Mitford, some slightly alarming remarks she recently made to an English jour- nalist notwithstanding, will con- tinue to give us books on French histo and people. Her new book, a study of the adult life of Louis XIV in his self-created setting, Versailles, sparkles with all the bright, pungent and infectious vitality that made her books on Mme de Pompadour and Voltaire at Cirey such effective evocations of the French past. In The Sun King she adds a few deeper, darker, more sombre notes to her usual narrative technique which other- wise is as unprettifled, down-to- earth, as full of light and taste as ever. Her account of the King's black last years In the shadows of defeat and death is dignified and moving without in the least descending to maudlin sentimentality-no mean achievement. But the delight which this book, like its predecessors, -onmmunidcates comes from the en- Vlable and by no means common circumstance that Miss Mitford writes about her chosen people In enuine, direct and honest sym- pathy, It is this that makes her cast, large in the present case, leap from the printed page and stay in the memory, She falters and fails only with people whom she dislikes, as with the second Madame, Duchess of Orleans, nde Liselotte of the Pal-. tinate, She does her .best to he fair to this \" great blonde Teutonic tomboy,\" but one senes the strain and the prejudice which, In the case of Mnami, one of history's great originals, Is our loss, But o wise, Miss Milford's sympatls. her shrewd and balancd sense of character, range widely and frely. r richly varied crowd moves aongI well ho(d toether by the dlAp jnoed and intricale rituil of Versa and the narrative control exercised with versatile ease by Miss Mitford, Above the crowd the Royal famlil above them h King The crowd-the word Is Justluif for an assembly of between two and five thousand people in seventeenth- century France-was made up, especially in its upper reaches, of licentious and bisexual libertines who certainly were in need of dis- cipline and taming by etiquette. Bearing in mind that this was the age of absolutism and aggressive wars, one sees the necessity for raising the King. by dint of the Versailles ceremonial, to an all but divine pre-eminence. On the retina of Miss Mitford's mental eye lives on a picture of the Versailles as it was before the Revolution dis- persed its treasures and \"stodgy\" Louis Philippe for ever ruined th6 glory of the interior arrangements. Thus we are able to see in its true setting the daily transformation of human, in Louis XIV's case all-too. human. nature into Majesty which gave the apparatus its ultimate significance. But Miss Mitford is equally accomplished in bringing the King and others back to us in more intimate scenes. Her portraits of the Duchesses. Marquises and widows Scarron 'who between them embellished the King's potent leisure hours are extremely entertaining, fair-minded and sensible, Miss Mitford, It seems to me, shows in this boe- greater adjectival restraint than elsewhere, and has done her his- torian's homework with consider- able application. Marly, St. Cyr an occasional touch of Fontaine bleau and some of the' King'i more despotic coach-rides apart, she has limited herself to Louis XIV at Versailles, and there i little of war, sieges and govern mental paper-work. The book has been splendidly produced, and many of the illus trations, rarely seen before, are of great interest and help: incredibly good value at three guineas, On Page 30 there is a full-page mar of France's frontiers - as Loul found them at the start of the reign; on Page 222 a tiny sketch tucked away in a corner of th frontiers well pushed outward. in the east and north, as he left them to his succeassors. These two maps should have been printed on opposite pages and on the sam scale for they illustrate the Sun King's most lasting achievement in the problem of France's vulner abilityt t is Interesting to refiec that he achieved it by dividj Gaul into three parts: Versaile., Paris and the rest,",

   "text_content" : "by EDWIN'MULLINS L4ke a long-laid4 o car, the autumn selason in the salerooms normally xslutters for a whilp before getting properly under way. But this year will come as ashock to anyone accustomed to giving October a nais. -With their very first sale, on October 6, Sotheby's auction what is probably the most important private collection of lithographs and drawings by Toulouse- Lautrec ever to have appeared in a London saleroom. The owner remains anonymous, yet this collection of over 200 items speaks for a thorough and discerning eye. It includes examples of most of Lautree's major graphlic work. Among the more famous and technically interesting of these is the set of 10 prints (plus cover and frontis- piece), published in an edition of 100 under the title Elies and con- sisting of studies of women, many of which are scarcely an advertise- ment for their sex. The theme is in fact the occupants of a brothel in which the artist himself bad lodgings in the Rue des Moulinp. These lithographs demonstrate better than any others Lautrec's ingenious flicking of colour on to the stone by means of a tooth- brush. Another lithograph, La Clownesse au Moulin-Roqge, is a trial proof to which Lautrec applied dabs of yellow in the margin to show exactly what colour he wanted. The following lot, Idylle Prlnciare, also a trial proof hand-coloured by the artist, is one that he had torn up, and was subsequently retrieved from the waste-paper basket by some cunning studio-hand, and pieced together again. Another rarity is a signed impres- sion of La Grande Loge, one of an edition of only 12. The collection also contains examples of the artist's earliest attempts at colour- lithography, including the richly comic L'Anglais au Moulin-Rouge of 1892. Immaculate in top-hat, cane, gloves and volatile moustache, he is addressing a red- haired girl in a feather-hat with an expression of \"D'yer hunt, m'dear? \" These are among the most valuable prints. Most of the old favourites are there too: les \"girls \"-Jane Avril, La Goulue, Marcelle Lender, May Belfort, Yvette Guilbert, Lole Fuller engaged in her- spectacular veil dance-as well as Sarah Bernhardt in the title-role of Phadre. Misia Natanson in the Revue Blanche poster, Oscar Wilde on a poster for his Salome, and Lautrec's cousin Dr. Gabriel Tapi6 de Celeyran driving an early motorcar and looking like someone out of a minstrel show. Christie's open their season a day earlier, October 5, and on a more nostalgic note: with a collection of working models of steam-engines of all kinds-locomotives, fire- engines, land and marine engines, etc. These include a 3Y-foot model of a Rio Grande locomotive, L'Anglais au Moulin Rogge made in the 1870s and rescued N from the Crystal-Palace fire before I the last war; a 4%-foot \"Flying ] Scotsman\"; a 1l-inch-high silver model of a Russian engine; and i a 10-foot American. locomotive, I \"Samson,\" which runs on a 15- 1 inch-gauge track. Altogether itkwill be an occasion i rich in sentimedt. These models all i work. Many were made by appren- tices for salesmen to demonstrate a < firm's prodects. Some are power- ful enough to draw 20 to 30 people. To4day, with the passing J of the steam age, they generate a high enthusiasm among collectors, who are aware that steam-power, though now but a beautiful toy, was once the major factor in England's industrial development. In early July I gave some reasons why the Government's recent Exchange Control Order, a Moulin Rogge which aims to halt gold-hoarding by insisting on Bank of England permission for the purchase and sale of gold coins dated after 1837, would unfairly strike at the genuine numismatist who does not hoard but is very anxious to acquire proof and pattern coins and speci- men sets. The sale at Glendin- ing's on July 12 showed the extent to which the market is already depressed. A Queen Victoria proof set of 1887 Jubilee coins, which had made Â£850 in January, realised only Â£640 in July; a George VI specimen set of 1937 (Â£400 in January) made Â£270; and an Edward VII speci- men set of 1902 Coronation coins (Â£310) made Â£180. And these prices were typical. Representations made to the Treasury on July 20 to exempt from the Order speci- men sets which were never adopted for circulation have so far met with no response. Move to Retain Caxton MS A move to avoid Caxton's tram lation of Books I to IX of Ovid' Metamorphoses, 1480, going ou of Britain was announced by th Department of Education anm Science yesterday. The manuscrip was sold for Â£90,000, the highes price then paid for any manuscrip at auction, at Sotheby's on June 2' to the El Dieff Bookshop, Nei York. The Department stated: \"The Reviewing Committee on the Ex- port of Works of Art have recom- mended that, if within three months, an offer of Â£90,000 is made for the purchase of the Caxton Manuscript by or on behalf of the British Museum, the Pepysian Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge, the Cam- bridge University Library, or any public institution in the U.K., then an export licence for the manu- script should not be issued.\"",

   "text_content" : "by TREVOR BAILEY as admhirably exciting with the utcome of the champions ip in loubt until the final day, but even his dramatic climax could not amonuflae the fact that it had been a non-vintage summer at both Test and County level. One reason for this on the domestic front has been the unpleasantly high percentage of standart pitches, which is clearly reected i a marked shortage of runs and the cheap cost at which some quite ordinary bowlers have secured their wickets. The pitches, combined with the 65-over limitation, has made life especially difficult for middle-order batsmen, and it comes as no sur- *rise to find 15 openers in the top 4 of the batting averages. On a bad wicket the player who gods in first has a chance to become acclimatised when it is at its best, before the effects of the roller have worn off and while the fielding captain is deciding upon his most ecfctive combination. This par- ticularly applies on a pitch which is sympathetic to spin. Dealing with the bal that lifts and turns is inevitably a problem, but it never appears quite so insuperable to a batsmen with runs in the book as to the one who has just arrived at the crease. In 65-over limitation matches, an opener still has the opportunity to build an innings on a sound foundation, and though the search for quick runs may cost him his wicket. in the later stages, he will by that time have acquired a reasonable score. Exactly the same applies in Gillette games and I wonder what percentage of \"man of the match\" awards have gone to opening batsmen. It must be very high. A glance at the national bowling averages shows very clearly why Yorkshire have taken the championship pennant. They have four bowlers-Nicholson, nling. worth, Wilson and Trueman-in the top ten, all with close -to 100 wickets or more, and costing under 18 apiece. In this connection it is interesting to know that of the next three counties in order of meit Worcester have twd bowlers in the current national averages, Somoef set three and Kent one, which all underlines the adage that \" Bowlers win matches.\" The Yorkshire batting, with the exception of Boycott and to a lesser degree Close, has frequently looked vulnerable, but It has boa able to put together sufficient runs to enable a powerful attack, sup- ported by excelleit fielding, and well directed, to win them enough matches. At the commencement of last week, Worcester were in a position to carry off the title and the Gillette Cup, but it was not to be, and they had the mortification of finishing as runners-up in both competitions. Nevertheless, they are to be con- gratulated on their, splendid effort to catch Yorkshire. Warwickshire's Gillette win pro- vided a classic example of the effectiveness in this competition of accurate seam bowling combined with astute captaincy. They were able to contain Worcester to a modest total, and then systematic* ally knock off the runs. It was an interesting rather than a classic final, with the excitement resulting more from the occasion and situation than from the cricket. Somerset did splendidly to come third. This high position was achieved very largely as the resu#t of team work with everyone con- tributing his share. Their batting was never strong, but their bowlers effectively overcame this deficiency, and they finished higher than a number of more talented teams. I would rate Kent as one of the best sides in the competition, and as they have a goodly quota of young and improving players, they should challenge strongly next year. Northants, with the best opening pair of batsmen, Milburn and Prideaux, in the country, and a varied attack were always formid- able opponents, while Leicester- shire, under the enthusiastic leadership of Tony Lock, were clearly the most improved side in the competition."

   "text_content" : "by DARE WIGAN THE RESULT of yesterday's St. Leger in which Sodium once again turned the tables on Charlottown, proves for the umpteenth time-if proof were necessary-that race horses cannot be regarded in the same light as machines. For example, at Newbury on August 13 in their previous en- counter, Chailotiown had finished many lengths in front of Sodium in the Oxfordshire Stakes run over one mile, five furlongs and 60 yards, and no excuse was offered for the dismal performance of G. Todd's colt, who had looked exceptionally well in the paddock before the race. Yet at Doncaster yesterday Sodium defeated Char. Go Shell for Pt ottown by approximately the same margin as he had done for the Irish Sweeps Derby, and, so far as could be seen, won strictly on merit. Charlottown did not fail owing to lack of stamina, for he showed ro kind of slackening after taking up the running from David Jack about two furlongs from the win- ning post. But Sodium, as at the Curragh, displayed the better rnishing speed and one can only assume that the excuse advanced ip these columns following his dis- ial performance at Newbury, that le failed to adapt himself to the ;oft ground on that occasion, was valid.",

   "text_content" : "By Professor R. I. THOMAS SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, PROPOSED BATH UNIVERSTY OF TECHNOLOGY The opening of the Severn oad Bridge is the first and most important of a series of -major transport innovations affecting Severnside, the region extending from Oloucester to Bridgwater and Barry. At first the new motorway is open only from the A48 west of Chepstow to the northern outskirts of' Bristol. burinp 1967 further sections will give a motorway from west of Newport to the Cotswolds, 'ind work will have begun on the extension of the MS .to Avonmoiuth. 'By 1971 the junction at Abpondsbury will be exchang- lng traffic between the M4 runing from London to South Wales and the MS from Birmingham to North Somerset. The first result is the oppor- tunity for a new integration of the Bristol and South Wales areas. The second is the progres. sive transformation of communi- cations between both South Wales and South West England and London and the Midlands. -Research Study These implications have been acknowledged by the Economic lannaing Councils for Wales and :USth West England. In May, 1966, they announced joint sponsorship of a research study y-^ team based on the-new Bth University of Technology and the University College of, Swansea, to provide evidence for future planning not only in the two regions concerned but alo where other similar projects are contemplated, such as Humber, side. In so far as this study breaks new ground in Britain it has wide implications for future policy. The potential of the area is clear. First, there is to be a feasibility study of a possible new city of up to Im. inhabi- tants to be established on Severnside in the next 20 years. Second, there is the possible study of the electrification of rail routes from London 'and Sheffield to Bristol and South Wales. The rejection at this time of the Portbury project of the Port of Bristol in no way lessens, the long-term potential. A direct' motorway will save 50 miles and avoid notorious congestion points such as Glou- cester and Chepstow at a toll cost of only 2s 6d per vehicle- crossing. The reduction in direct transport costs is only the first benefit. Areas on both sides of the Bridge may now be served from only one depot. Not only is vehicle utilisation made more productive; economies in ware- housing and *administration are possible. Furthermore, the Bridge will 'lead to economies or new :.YE -BRIDGE tw I f MON-Il SW 5ev gAS' I.' am r ~~ f' ,,4.ji. ~1 8EYERM BRIDGE ~I a a a a i- I. d market opportunities in distribu tion and commercial services a all levels. In the long run thi Bridge will also have an impac on the location of factories offices and shops, on populatiol growth, labour mobility an( recreational patterns. From studies already undet taken in the Bristol area, a dis tinction can be drawn betweei short-term changes, mainly ii distribution and recreation pat terns, and long-term effect which concern industrial loca tion and the development of nev residential * and commutinj patterns. In distribution an obvious stel would appear to be concentra tion on a single depot, unless the volume of business on both sides was very large. The prob- lem is then that of selecting on which side of the bridge the single depot is to be maintained. At once a whole series of vari- ables has to be considered. First, what other areas than Severnside are served from existing depots and in what volumes? Second, what are the main sources of supply? A firm may supply areas from Cornwall to Southampton from Bristol, or a Cardiff depot may cover Pem- brokeshire and Mid-Wales. Is the best solution a major depot in Severnside with minor ones in Plymouth or West Wales? Supply Point Already there are signs of concentration on one supply point with a reduction of the redundant depot to a local office collecting orders. Other solu- tions itclude firms dispensing with local wholesalers or, espe- cially where transport can be used on return runs, specialising in part of a product range at Bristol and Cardiff depots so that each serves both sides. Short-term effects are likely in such fields as retailing, news. paper circulation, personal and busines services and recreational travel. Already advertising cam- paigps including some by local authorities are in evidence. News. papers aon both sides are ex- pected to seek new circulations even to the extent of launching new editions-a recognition of the very different cultures of the areas on each side. For some time people will be attracted by the novelty of cross. ingto to the other side, but this effect should be over by mid. November. How much of the new trade will endure after a few months? *How far will the department stores of Bristol and Cardiff seiek new custom both for Christmas and the New Yeaj sales? Touring Areas At first, two-way traffic is likely, but the question is which of the three centres-Cardiff. ess Newport or Bristol-is likely tc Â»th prove the biggest magnet? New. >b- port may lose much of its shop. ng ping hinterland to Bristol. be As between Bristol and Car. ed. diff, however, the outcome is less Ã½ri- clear. Bristol is the biggest cit) -st, with such amenities as its [do theatres and zoo. Its shopping ots facilities in so far as other than id, national chains are concerned of offer fewer advantages. In this sly respect Bath may be an attrac to tion, more especially when the a motorway is open to Tormarton m. in 1967. Is People living in the valleys of Wot South East Wales will now have ies easy access by road to Bristol, Bath and the touring areas of the Cotswolds and Somerset. Bris. tolians will have similar access of to the Wye Valley and Mid. sly Wales, as well as to Cardiff and he the Vale of Glamorgan. This is ice bound to increase tourism withiv I.u the area and also bring in day ng trippers from the Midlands, pe. The bridge itself will be a tourisi be attraction. ng Turning now to industrial de- at velopments on Severnside, ii so seems unlikely that - there will be much short-term effect on in existing manufacturing indus- vs. tries, but long-term effects may nd be very important. lal In many respects, the twc m- areas, are very different is sal industrial structure. South Wales vs- is traditionally an area of heavy sx. industry and mining with owner. ins ship 4Obhcntrated in a few large An reial view of the bridge from the Wehbb rde looking towards Glouc stersuIre. Â·Â· organisations with London- based management. Industry introduced since 1935 consists mainly of branches of firms based in the Midlands and the South-East, only a few of which have made South Wales their headquarters. In contrast, Bristol has some large national con- cerns and an infrastructure of smaller firms. Apart from deve- lopments near Avonmouth, it has been difficult for new in- dustry to move into the area and obtain IDC's. Expansion has been mainly through reconstruc- tion and extension of existing premises. The new plants are capital intensive, with limited labour requirements. Prime Purpose Clearly to South Wales the enhanced attractiveness of the whole region to new industry is a prime purpose. of the Bridge. At present development is vir- tually impossible, for planning reasons, close to the Bridge, and the Welsh Development District does not include the coastal belt until well west of Cardiff. One of the hopes in South Wales is that the improved A48 with its motorway by-pass of Port Talbot will, in conjunction with the Bridge, open up West.Wales, the area from Swansea to Milford Haven. The extent to which this happens will depend so far as road transport is a factor, on the extent to which South East England traffic to West Wales uses the new route. The point is that it will be several years before the M4 moves west from Maidenhead to its 1967 eastern terminal on top of the Cotswolds. There may be a good case for some time for keeping to the more mortherly A40 route via Gloucester, espe- cially for traffic to West Wales. The problem facing both Economic Planning Councils is how to attract suitable new industry into the mote remote parts of the region - West Glamorgan, Carmarthen and Pembroke in Wales; Devon, Cornwall and West Somerset in England. The main obstacle is their remot\"eess, measured in time rather than mileage. Road transport is vital because many railways have been closed. Roads are also crucial to tourism. The immediate road improve1 ments have only a limited effect on the industrial prospects as the main acceleration can only come with the completion of the M4 and MS together with the improvements of the spine roads penetrating far into the two regions. However, if planning and other controls limit growth of the Bristol and Cardiff- Newport areas this may lead to some development in adjacent areas such as Mid-Glamorgan or Taunton. Both' regions face- problems on land use not only on Severn- side but also *as development leapfrogs down the main lines of communication. In the South West there is the further compli- cation of overspill, mainly from London but with some Birming- ham overspill at Weston-super- Mare. For national policy, the main questions are, therefore, to what extent Severnside is to develop as an estuarine city-region and how** far its growth can help the other parts of the two regions. The improvement in communications V at this stage brings South Wales M' rhtarer to London, the South East and Southampton, but as the motorways are completed, Birmingham and the North are brought nearer to the South West and it is then that two major questions will have to be, faced. New Port First, whatever the real reasons for the recent rejection of the Portbury scheme, the fact remains that the Bristol Channel is one of the potential areas for a new port to offset the magnets of London and Liverpool. The motorway developments make Birmingham and the Home X Counties part of the hinterland of a Severnside port. Second, as existing industries either decline or become more efficient, the result is likely to be lower employment in them in South-West Wales. The prob- lem there as in Cornwall and parts of the West Country is one of selection of areas for do. velopment. The completion of this bridge J is therefore an event of potenti .1 ally great economic significance. Are all the parties-business. men, planning authorities, Government Departments--yet aware of its promise? DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Consulting Engineer: Mott, Hay & Anderson. Freen Fox & Partners.

   "text_content" : "By . ATE SITE AGENT, ASSOCIATED BRIDGE BUILDERS LIMITED 'The construction of. the Severn Bridge was phased in with that of the Forth Road Bridge to take advantage of the organisation which had been bult Up and to enable easy ransfer of some of the special Clant which has been used on both sites. The-same three omr- panies have been involved, lasmely, Sir William Arrol and Co., the Cleiveland Bridge and Engineering Cominpany, and Dor- man Long (Bridge and Engineer- ng), who formed the company known as Associated Bridge Builders for the work at the Severn. The order was placed by the Ministry of Transport, and the Joint Engineers to the Ministry are. Messrs. Mott Hay and Anderson and Messrs. Free- nan, Fox and Partners, the. latter- being responsible for the design. A central organisation, staffed nainly from the three comrn- panies, was set up in London early in 1962 to carry out the letailed planning of the work of erection, and ii was the aim. of c this organisation to foresee the t engineering problems involved r n deciding on erection methods. , Design of the extensive tem- c porary works and structures was required, and the calculatiohs in- 4 volving the main structure at various stages of construction t provided full occupation for this i :eam for a number of years, in I close co-operation with the de- signers. Slightly Shorter The design of the Severn Bridge represents a very con- I siderable departure from previ- . ously accepted conditions, and is i an almost complete breakaway from the classical design for 1 long suspension bridge spans em- i ployed up to this time. This has a resulted in a considerable saving in steel and in the consequent < deadweight imposed on the foundations. Although the Severn Bridge is only slightly shorter than the Forth Road 1 Bridge, the weight of steel used 1 was about two-thirds, being somewhat under 20,000 tons. The 400-foot towers are formed by two slender legs uni- ted by deep cross members, and each leg is a simple rectangular box composed of stiffened plates of high yield steel. The 20-inch diameter cables are of the usual parallel wire construction and represent the only standard feature of the' bridge, based on previous American practice. The sus- penders, however, connecting the roadwhy tth ar inclined to the v of hanging vertically, as I she usual practice. The suspended *-'structure carrying the roadway is in the form of a flat steel box, 10 feot deep and 75 feet wide, with cantilevered extensions, giving an overall width of 104 feet 6 inches. It is of a rough streamline shape, which reduces wind- effect to about one-third of that which would be norm- ally expected, This shape was decided on after aieriit of wind tunnel experimla1nts by;,ithe designers, and its use non junction with -the c40 d 'u penders is the ub held by Sir Oi bet Ã½ R d partner in FPreman, Foi an Apart orm wind tug-l x; Pwork on \"e 'on. sultants, th a their ,wn s of auo.test to Or var uÂ« stageI of the or aod ft of thse con- odr . tesits on models of the towirs which indicated that serious arodynamic osllatlon would be exprienced unless preventative measures were tken. Suitable damping arranmeants wre divlsed and proved itirely satlifatory in practice. The leg of the towers are supported on heavy steel base which wsr built into thbs con* S op the top of the river randeach leg was emnored u .to ib lfwI romw In triMo eS ^{* kiAM rt~M Di-^~l~l it rl i 'I Spinnlin the mnal wuppoitbg ebia. city erection crane. T'bis struc- ture was formed. by a large box member -stabilised by rollers which ran oh the inside faces of each tower leg. The sections of the tower were 55 feet 6 inches high, and on completion of each section the climbing sitruture raised itself this distance by means of hydraulic jacking machinery working on special links attached to the tower. As erection pro- ceeded, a man/materials hoist was installed in each leg and extended as the tower .grew upwards,'so that easy access was always maintained to the work- ing fronts. The tower plates were connected to each other by high-tensile bolts passing through internal flanges, which led to much simplfied staging and resulted in the very clean external ,appearance. Cable Saddles Construction was started on the Beachley tower, followed a* month later by work on the Aust tower. As the latter is some 1,500 feet out in the river, with no road connection, all material for this was ferried across the river from the working area which had been established on the Beachley side, and from which, closely co-ordinated trans- port arrangements had to be made to keep both towers in phase. The steelwork -of the towers was completed in about six months. Following the fixing of the fabricated steel cable saddles, eigWingY5 tons each, to thh* reO tops, work ons-4tattsd c the f th temporary walkways from anchorage to anchorage over the tops of the two towers. These were com- posed of wire rope strands covered with high tensile wire mesh for floors and parapets, for use by the gangs concerned in the work of cable spinningi The installationof the walkwaysiand the elaborate cable pniang maohbnery set up on the aBeah. .ley Anhoirage occupied oerf iye months. . csch main cable was com- tol of '8,322 sile gOlvatiae\" an In diamwt, and the -ttallsa*Jj of wire involvd was Molw0 oes.

Following com- paction of the cables, cast steel cable bands were fixed and the suspension ropes were attached to them ready for the raising of the suspended structure carrying the deck. The erection of this new type of deck called for special con- sideration. For construction purposes, the deck box was divided into 88 60-feet long sec- tions, and by providing these with bulkheads near each end, they formed a natural barge-like structure. It was accordingly decided to float these in the river without any other means of buoyancy, and a scheme was accordingly worked out on this basis. Each section weighed nearly 130 tons, and the aim was to position them under the centre line of the bridge, and to hoist them into place by means of heavy tackles carried by beams spanning the main cables and moving on them from one posi- tion to the next. Further wind tunnel tests were carried out at the National Phy- sical Laboratory to determine the behaviour of single sections suspended from their lifting tackles, and also to investigate the likely behaviour of the bridge at various stages of con- struction. Precautions were taken to deal with the unstable con- ditions disclosed. Of equal importance were flo- tation experiments carried out on single sections in one of the ship's tanks At the National PIysical' lAboratory to deter- n. 10.towing A characteristics. Some full-scale tests were also madeon the river at theAite with barges lashed together to repre- sent a section, and it was soon discovered that normal towing methods would not give the pre- cision required. Difficult River The River Severn is a difficult one on which to operate, with a tide range of 46 feet, currents of up to 10 knots, and difficult cross currents whose directions vary with the state of the tide. The problem was solved by building a special pusher type of craft, designed by ADD' mparine consultant Mr. H. Mur. ray Taylor, whic 'proved emin nently successful. This craft was itted with four engines with fully swivelling propellers, which gave control in any direction, and it pushed a section in front of itself. The whole assembly was arranged to operate as a unit and heavy anchors were provided to bold it in the stream. Lifting beams and heavy tackles were supported on the main cables and could be moved along them. The tackles were operated by 10-ton winches situ- ated on the tower tops, and were provided with qtfick operating attachments at their lower end for connecting to the sections. Deck Sections All the units of the suspended strcture were fabricated in the shops of the three companies in Glasgow, Darlhigton and Mid-. dlesbrough, and were trans- ported.by road and rail to the yard of the Fairfield Shipbuild- ing and Eng. Company' at Chepstow, where two wartime slipways were cleared for assem- bly. Here the deck sections were put together, carefully matched and welded for launching into the River Wye, some three miles from the bridge site. After launching at high spring tides, the sections were placed on moorings in the River Wye and also in a sheltered reach of the River Severn, and were brought out for hoisting into position during the periods of neap tdes, in order to carry out the operation ,in currents not exiceding about: five knots, on thi basis of the test\\previously carried out. It willab. appreci- ated that there werdjbus only two periods' in eachi month, of, two to si. days each; 'duing which erection couldtake plac , and there were occaqions when even the whole of these could not be used owing to the nci. dence of bigh winds and bad weather generally. There is no doubt that when operating over more settled Waters, a much greater speed of construction could be achieved. Despite the changeable condi. tions, the \\ work proceeded steadily and smoothly and the considerable thought that had been put into this ioeration was amply repaid. Frection was started from the centre of the main span where the cables were about 33 feet above their final position, working alter* nately towards each tower, after which the side spans were erected from the anchorages outwards. Special arrangements had to be made in the west side span, as about half of this was over dry land and a ramp had to be built on which the sections could be hauled from the water to lie in their correct positions. During the early stages, the sections, which were tem- porarily connected at their top edges only, hung in a reverse camber until over half of the main span was in position, when the bottom joints began to close. It was then possible to start the in situ welding on selected joints, and welding was in full swing by the time the towers. had oeen reached. In this type of welded construction, it was very important that fabrication and assembly should be carried out to very fine limits, and a very high standard of workman- ship was achieved. The deck, which carries four lanes of traffic, was surfaced with a li-inch covering of mastic asphalt, and even this com- paratively thin coating accounted for over 20 per cent. of the total deadweight of deck. Surfacing of the footpaths and cycle track was carried out in a very thin coating of rubberised bitumen, and the finishing works included the erection of crash barriers formed by the ropes 'which had previously supported the footwalks during spinning, and the lighting standards and telephone system. After the phenomenal snow- fall early in 1963, weather conditions were comparatively good, and the incidence of high winds was not excessive. How. ever, one of the worst periods was during the cable spinning operations where 30 per cent. weather loss, was sustained, and during the winter period 1965-66 conditions were also far from ideal. Safety Aspect The whole construction work has been carried out without serious labour disputes and without stoppages of any kind, as care was taken to reach agree- ment with the unions involved in advance,of the carrying out of the work at each stage. The agreed conditions have been loyally observed by both parties with great satisfaction to all concerned. The safety aspect of all operations on the site was the subject of earnest consideration. Working points and access to them were provided with sub- stantial stages and a safety organisation.wai set up on the site to k,6'iall these matters under review. Protective helmets were ,v by all men and staff at altub es. Life jackets were alsbvom e where appropriate and a safty at was in attendance during ta wole of the con- strurto e pc.ident rate has, fortunately, oen very low. and the two fa tie4 which regret- tably did oftr werxe due to somewhat extra lr cum- stances which ate u Ylikly, to be repeated.",

Not until the Industrial Revo- lution were the resources and technical skills available to con- sider bridging the gap. Aust is , less than a mile from Beachley as the crow flies; by road the Journey through Gloucester was, and is. almost 60 miles. More Practical It was recognised early in the 19th century that the bridging of the Severn was a practical pro- position,; but it was left to the railway age to advance schemes further. Some ideas were ex- travagant in the extreme; others were more practical. In Febru- ary, 1842, Samuel Baldwyn Rogers of Nantyglo produced a remarkable pamphlet proposing to establish \"Sama s r Work. ing Benefit Societies and a magnificent Bridge across the * mouth of the River Severn at the New Passage in Gloucester. shire.\" The bridge, consisting of 21 arches each of 324 feet span, was to be built \"with the wasting energies of the United Kingdom, without expense to the state or to any ,party, or individual whatever. There were to be railway tracks and a carriage- way, shops n Â£ covered roof. Rogen's utopian torced-labour camps for the poor remained mercifully in the world of fantasy. Men of business were also in- terested. In 1845 Thom** Foll- Jass, q, C.E., county aur- vo o*U Gloucestershirei drew Ps * ftu?.4 for a railway to Aust. James ZWai!LevWL1., F S, re ported favourably to thlA Lords Commissioner of the Adiralty In 1846 and the Bristol and Liverpool Junction Railway Company were in support. The approved design allowed for a height of 120 feetst hiiwater, 140 feet at half-floodÃ½,and paoved too bold even for the. buatligS adventurous Early Victorian Capital costs wre reckoned too great, and thedenarglesot railway bpuilders directd ese*where. 'Not until 1879 was a railwa-y bridge built-much furthor .upstream at Sharpness. Io 1886 the i sgni' cent (and itill indiisensable) Severn Tunnel was constructed at a cost of Â£2m. Discussion of a possible bridge persisted, stimulated in the early 20th ;en- tury by the spread of the motor car. After World War I several interested councils put forward suggestions. The Ministry of Transport in 1923 favoured the Beachley-Aust site, but the situa- tion was complicated by the existence of a powerful group in favour, of. a barrage and an elaborate (and very expensive) hydro-electric scheme. The financial crisis of 1931 put a temporary end to hopes. In August, 1935, *however, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, consulting engineers, prodiuced for the Roads Improvement Association a detailed ahalysis of the position. They considered two possibilities: a bridge on the present site of Beachley-Aust, or a bridge lower down the Severn at English Stones, some 250 yards from the site of the Severn Tunnel. They favoured the second scheme which, though longer, promised .to be slightly cheaper than the Beachley-Aust plan with its inevitable comn panion bridge over the Wye. The Epglish Stones bridge was to have a central span of 1,400' .feet to coventh- deep channel known as \"The Shoots\" with two long approach viaducts. Objection to the English Stones idea came from the 'Oreat Western Railway, from naviga- tional interests, and from vested interests further up the river. Rearmamient and the war made ,ractical realisatioh of a Severn 'Bridge scheme impossible. Agreed Site Debate continued during the war. Some scebticism was ex. pressed concerning tbe* lue of the bridge to SoUt*,s*Wpls ' t the Welh r sri u Avi. sory Council t', iired it. The post-war Labour Govenisdent putit high on the list of priorities ina. 1946, ad came the agreed site. It .was nearly accepted as part of a capital investment policy 'in 1947, but again the general economic situation proved: tin- favourable. - The scheme was shelved under the austere policies of Sir Stafford Cripps. In the succeeding decade the new Forth Bridge gained priority over the Sqvern, and it was not until 1961 that work began on the foundations. The comple- tion date, arranged then and observed now, of 1966, marks the end of over 120 years of plans, hopes, frtustritirons and final success. Discussion of such a huge single project as the Severn Bridge necessarily involved some justification of purpose. Full- james in 1845 underlined the social and economic benefits: \" A population of upwards of 11 millions (would) benefit from the erection of the bridge both in personal inter- course And 'in interchange of produce.\"' Walker, in connection with the same project, stressed national needs. He commented on the misery of mud and in- convenience that awaited the traveller at the Aust/Beachley ferry, and stated-a true son of the Age of Improvement-that he knew no great communica- tion in this land so bad, or there- fore where an improvement is so much' wanted.

After World War 11 tbe,eppbasis achanged agai. The Labour Minister of Trans- port in May, 1946, stressed the importance of the bridge as a vital link in the Government's policy of development of indi- vidual areas -of Wales and of the port facilities of South Wales. The Westerni Mall re- ferred to the bridge as a stage in the development of the isola- ted bottle-neck of South Wales. H. E. Aldington, the chief engineer of the Ministiy of Transport, referred to the ab- sence of the bridge as stultifying Industrial growth in South Wales for many generations. Nearly all comnmentators at this stage stressed the great advantages which the bridge would bring to South Wales. More Prosperous Twenity years later the area is much more prosperous, and a shade more suspicious of Bristol acumen. Why was the Severn Sea renamed the Bristol Channel? The fear has even been expressed that Wales could become a satel- lite of mighty Bristol. . But the bridge carries traffic both ways. South Wales has the labour and the industiy, and should welcome the new oppor- tunities open to existing enter- prises as well as for the develop- ment of new ventures. The communities on both sides of the Severn stand to benefit from the closer and easier contact, economic, and social, which this great engireering feat, q\"rnpcent ltd kong overdue,, l prov them.",

Hls Idea wa to have railway track caageway,a carriageway, shops and a covered way. ^ ' * i i'~:Â·, -,.. Â·,. C:wn.6~ :,'Â·I Following the qpening of the bridge the road journey -from Bristol to Cardiff will take little mort than an hour, as against the previous 91-miles journey via Chepstow and Gloucester, or the equally frustrating and time- consuming journey via the Beachley-Aust ferry. The in. habitants of both cities will thus be brought closer together initially .by the shortened dis tance, but it remains to be seen what other ties will bind them with the passage of time. Culturally each city has a great deal to offer the other, and it is not inconceivable that over the years there will develop a mutual arrangement of sharing the arts and music in the form of joint exhibitions and concerts. There will also be greater oppor- tunities for joint functions of professional bodies, trade organi- s sations and other instititions. . The theatres of Bristol have always been an attraction for South Walians and for many years excursions have been run regularly by British Railways. Greater numbers of theatregoers will now be able to visit Bristol, where the Old Vic is reputed to be the oldest theatre in the country, its policy being to pro- duce the classics interspersed with modiern And untried plays. Other attractions will incluade the 1BrWubl .Zoo# tW.- Suspension,, Srg*' acri behAvon. OoGidle . the wide Wxpns of Durdbam Downs, and the historic docks from which, at the end of the 15th century, John Cabot set off on the voyage which was to end in the discovery of Newfound- land. Natural Beauty Bristolians will find Cardiff a city of much architectural and natural beauty which boasts one 'of the finest Civic Centres in the world. Adjacent to the shopping centre the buildings include the City Hall, Law Courts, National Museum of Wales, National War Memorial and the Welsh Office of the Secretary of State and, together with Cardiff Castle which dominates the western end of the shopping centre, will become a great attraction to visitors from the Bristol area. Between the wars there was a steady migration of people to Bristol from South Wales and many of them, with their families, will undoubtedly take advantage of the shortened dis- tance to visit the Welsh Folk Museum established at St. Fegan's Castle, and also the restored Llandaff Cathedral where contemporary work blends with the old, an outstanding feature being the Epstein Majestas crowning the concrete parabolic arch and organ case spanning the ave. The increased opportudities for tourism will be exploited to the full by travel agsncies and individuals aliOke. i Is' the springboard to,: the ittiactive holiday country in the duth- western counties of Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, while Cardiff is the gateway, through the beautiful Vale of Glamorgan, to the seaside resorts of South and West Wales, and the majestic beauty of the mountainous country in mid- Wales. It is not easy at this stage to forecast the extent of the busi- ness linkage which will develop between the twg cities. Such bodies as' insurance companies, building societies, finance houses, etc., have established, regional and branch ofices in each town. I think it is likely that, in future, regional offices will be limited to one or other A these towns, but not both. Owmmercially, there- fore, the two towns will be brought closer together, and much of the work now conducted separately will become inte- grated. In warehousing and distribu- tion, I expect to. see a closer linkage. For some time there has been a movement on both sides of the Severn towards the setting up of branches on the other, this sometimes taking the form of a merger between two established firms. I It would seem that the weakest links wil be in retailing lp IkeLpers on both sides of the S.Severn have expirssedh opinionthat, after the firstx- citement of the bridge bas passed, shoppers will continue to shop as they have always done, and neither side envisages a busi- ness linkage with the other., Cardiff has a good,.attractive shopping centre which is con- centrated into a cleafly-defined, convenient area. Bristol has two distinct shopping centres, more than a mile apart, and it will be interesting to watch the develop ing pattern of shopping. Six-day Week While some Cardai close all day on Wednesday, others operate a six-day shopping week, but all retailers are open all day on Saturday. This wi'Tbe an attraction for many riAltol families to spend a day in Cardiff on Saturdays, for much of the Park Street shopping area of Bristol closes at 1 p.m. on that day. To sum up, I expect a.closer relationship to develop between Cardiff and Bristol in the fields * of culture, tourisMi and conMMr- : cially ao far as regional id ' national organisations a rc0on- Scerned, but, in retallin,:'.tithlk both cities will-cemali,.

Ever since the Tacotna disastr in 1940 the attention of engi- neers concerned with suspension bridges lhad been concentrated on their tendency to oscillate ip certain conditions of wind, and although the phenomenon was not fully understood, 'it was realised that the shape of thei suspended structure, that is\" thbe deck hung from the cables,:lad, a decisive ifluence on the aero; dynamic behaviour.

Evidently the lattice girders had the effect 'of .breaking up the' major wind eddies into many smaller ones\" which had , no. common sequency or -direction, while the plate' girder: throws.off the eddies as long waves which exert vertical forces on the struc- iure as they break away. These forces act alternately on either side of the bridge, aad if their. frequency coincides .with the natural frequency of the structure the . oscillation Will steadily increase.

The result is the nei Severn Bridge which in -the - rnm of its suspended structure, is quite revolutionary; It pr=ovdes a sltw solution to the problem of aerodynamnic stability. Itptead of breaking up the wind eddies with lattice girders, gaps and slots, the section is so streamlined that no eddies are produced. The deck is a flat, closed steel box 10 feet deep and 80 feet wide tapered on each side to a sharp edge to which is attached a 15 feet-wide fin 4 feet below the roadway deck level. These fins, which appear to havean aerodynamically stabilis- ing effect, carry the footway on one side and the cycle track on the other. There are no kerbs-only two lines of handrailing and crash 'bairiers of stretched wire rope which' cause the mininmuin inter- SfeAnce with the smooth flow of the wind across the upper Ssurface. The deck section in fact i is streamlined as far as possible like the wing of an aircraft, and ithis naturally brings about a big *Â°uuieo&teipfoi*6 xnted on thature by 4theÂ«ind.

The best loca- tion for these was found to be tight againit the sharp edges of the box. The results of the tdsts on the simple model were so promising that the design was developed in more detail and a scale model made with all its features accur- ately represented. The wind tun- nel tests on this model proved the aerodynamic stability of the section except for a slight ten- dency to oscillate at a wind speed of about 10 mph, which in the case.of riveted or bolted trusses' would. normally be sup- pressed by their inherent struc- tural damping. The structural damping measured in existing ihrides is nresumed to be caused by slight slipping at the joints, but no such effect could be ex- pected in a completely welded box as proposed in the new design. Damping Effect It was therefore decided to in- corporate additional damping by taking advantage of the hys- teresis or energy absorbing pro- pearty of the wire ropei hangers. For this purpose the two parts of each hanger are separated and inclined to the vertical, so that %iny' tedency of the deck to Soscillate would subject the ropes e to changes in length. Such f changes in length and therefore in stress would cause the rope e to absorb energy in much the g same way as axial dampers on a n motor-car, and according to cal- 1 culation the total damping effect of the hanger ropes employed . in this way would be sufficient d to prevent any progressive in- creaseof oscillations of the deck -. at the low wind speed that tests d had shown to be critical. h The practicability of manufac- d ture of the different parts of the ,- structure and assembly and erec- - tion were given the most careful i1 consideration in the early stages ig of design. This is most important d where new forms of construction I, are being introduced because C- any failure to study and solve d the problems involved is liable ' to result in delays, expense, and general dissatisfaction 'on the part of the contractors. The component parts of the . box were designed as stiffened ,y plates about 8 feet wide and s 60 feet long, the maximnum con- . venient size for despatch to the . site. These sectjoibs were to be' i assembled into a contitnuous box d and completely welded except it for a circumferential joint every o 60 feet. The 60\"fet lengths of box, each weighing about 150 tons, were to be separated an- floated out to the bridge for erection with lifting tackle hang- ing from the cables. Having i been built together on the slip- - ways before launching into the t river, the sections were sure to I fit accurately after erection. Box Section s This method of erection dis- closed an incidental advantage of this design. In other bridges e where the deck structure is - erected by lifting sections from I1 the water it is necessary to pro- s vide special barges to support it them; the box section, however, n can easily be made watertight to e float in 2 feet of water.

Thi red 'Keuper marl which forms the cliffs on each side of the river overlies hard limestone. The limestone outcrops on the foreshore at the east side where the east anchorage is situated forms an island at low tide-the Ulverstotne Rock-on which' the east pier is .built. At the west anhborage site the limestone is considerably deeper-about 60 feet 'below ground level-and at thie west pier. site it was too deep -to form an economical foundation. The foundations for the main bridge - consist of two solid concretepiers in the form of a continuous' wall with pointed ends, which support the main tosers and two massive concrete anchbrages, ekcb weighing 90,000 'tns, which resist thepull of the main suspension cables.

All materials on the east side, approximately 120,000 tons, had to be passed over Aust cliff (100 feet high) as no suitable access existed at a low level. Steel Viaduct First, a level area was con- structed at the base of the cliff just above high waters: level, on which- were. located concrete mixers; air compressing plant aind workshops. Fronmthis a steel viaduct was built to carry two rail tracks and two .foot- ways. This viaduct provided access first to the east anchorage 500 feet from the cliff and then to the east pier 1,500 feet from the cliff.

New Shape The effectiveness of this new shape is aided by the way in which the suspender unit are designed and used. In counter- acting the movements which may be set up by wind forces, the suspender units 'can act in a similar fashion to the shock absorbersof a motor-car.

Wye Bridge for recording strains induced by traffic. These recorders operate in conjunction with a dynamic weighbridge so that correlation can be made between vehicle weights' and the strains they induce in the deck members. Observations will be made' from time to time of the behaviour of both the' Severn and the Wye Bridges and the various charac- .teristics correlated with those predicted.- Emergency telephones, con. J,-1J , vurslsMl z . ur nrz .3ri necting directly with the police at. thaecontrol entre, are pro- vided Â»-i roughly quarter-mile intervals so that the driver of any vehicle which has broken dtW can ..report his -position at nce. The piolice will then in- struct the operators of the service area at Aust to take appropriate action - a special recovery vehicle will always be available and can, if necessary, cross the bridge by either the cycle track or footway.. Apparatus will' be installed early next year which-will enable the police to give directions to drivers by means of illuminated signs at quarter-mile. intervals if hazards arise from obstruction or weather. Salt is normally used as the dc-icing agent for roads; but, in order to reduce the risk of cor- rosion of the steelwork, a special .substance (urea) will be used when de-icing between the Aust and Newhouse round- abouts is necessary. The Severn Bridge Tolls Act, 1965, which empowers the Minister of Transport to levy tolls, includes power for a local authority to act as the Minister's agent for. toll collections. The Gloucestershire County Council has agreed to do this job. The Council have appointed a manager, responsible to the County Treasurers to supervise the collection of tolls and he will have under his control a staff which includes 20 toll col- lectors and seven inspectors. A greatV deal of up-to-date technology has gone into making toll collection both fool- proof and swift. Both east- bound and west-bound traffic will pay tolls (Isfor solo motor- cycles and. 2s 6d for all other vehicles) at' Aust, on the eastern approach to the bridge. At this uI 1I point the two-lane motorway will widen out to accommodate a line of seven toll booths. From an administration build- ing alongside the motorway' the manager and inspectors ',will have a full view of the booths, and the light signals 'on each booth will facilitate a check of collectors' activities. Thd middle three booths will be cap bI of serving traffic in eitherd ifttion. so that eight lakes cei be served in all, and in \" tidal flitWo'con- ditions it will be possib1 forilve collection lanes t beopi ating in one direction andithrefihi the other. In quiet perio'ds, of col- lection lane .in ea.diretion may be sufficient. TolU 'Payft When a collector s a toll payment, he *inl depress a key which will actuate signalling and recording apparatus, con- trolled by an electronic system in which the \" brain \" is a small computer housed in the adminis. tration building. Collectors backed by modern equipment of this kind can achieve very high collection rates. When a col. lector goes off duty, his takings will be checked against the record maintained by the elec- tronic equipment. In the first full year of opera- tion, it is estimated that normal traffic, excluding the initial flood of sightseers, will amount to about 5m. vehicles-an avetage of .nearly 15,000 -vehicles- per d4y, producing a .daily toll revenue of about Â£1800 ' The design of the Severn Bridge is already being hailed as the most advanced in the world. The provision which has been made for its maintenance and operation is, necessarily, pvery bit as advanced as the stMrcture itself.",

   "text_content" : "By W. M. MAISEY CHIEF CIVIL ENGINEER, THE CLEVELAND BRIDGE AND ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED The Wye Bridge and Viaduct is an integral part of the Severn Valley crossing. As the site chosen for bridging the Severn is just above the confluence with its tributary the Wye, a bridge across the Wye was an essential part of the scheme and is in fact a straight line extension of the Severn Bridge. A \" bridle \" bridge design was adopted for the main span, which is 770 feet long with anchorage spans of 285 feet. The Viaduct from the bridge to the West anchorage of the Severn Bridge consists of 10 spans vary. ing from 182 feet to 210 feet while west of the Wye a short viaduct contains two spans each of 210 feet, making an overall length of 3,784 feet. For both the viaduct and the bridge, the chief structural ele* ment is a trapezoidal box girder choben for its great torsional strength and rigidity. Wind tun- nel tests were carried but on this type of girder, which is suitably shaped to mipinisi the effect of wind forces antid to ensure aero. dynamic stability. the box girder is 10 feet 6 inches deep and 100 feet 6 inches wide, including on each side 14 feet 9 inches wing members which will carry foot. ~__ _ __ __ __ ways and cycle tracks. A high tensile steel plate -I of an inch thick forms the top flange with longitudinal troughs welded on the underside. The bottom flange and web plates are stiffened by single bulb flats and the whole box is stiffened with diaphragms which are spaced generally at 14-feet centres. This girder is supported on hol- low box steel trestles which are pivoted at top and bottom. At each end of the central span a single box sectiontower 96 feet high and pivoted at road level supports a central staying cable anchored to the box girder at 255 feet either side of the tower. The cable consists of 20 24-inch diameter galvanised wirei spiral strands arranged in a truncated, equilateral triangle having a horizontal base permit- ting the use of a simple saddle at the tower top. The total tonnage of steel in the viaduct and bridge is 8,550 and of this 6,100 tons is high yeld steel. Potudations to the viaduct trestles are 10 feet 6 Inches square shafts of rein- forced concrete that bell out to 14 feet square in the last 6 feet of depth. 'The river piers are founded on limestone at 60 feet deep on the east bank and 22 feet deep on the west bank. These piers were constructed in open caissons, it not being found necessary to use compressed air during the sinking. Panels and members forming the box and trestle sections were brought to two assembly yards which were so arranged that each yard could build five units Sat any time. The 56 feet long units were assembled nose to tail in order to template, one to another and every 8 or 9 days tbe.units were moved forward one bay. By this method it was possible to achieve a perfect fit for welding when erected. The completed units, weighing up to 129 tons, were winched up a lln-4 ramp, the first to its fnal position odl st0jin and subsequent units on to e top of the first and then wheeled along the erected steelwork and on to a cantilevered erection girder suspended beneath the erected steel. The er etion girder embodied a jacking system Which lowered the unit 10 feet 6 inches, the unit then being pulled back and welded to the erected steel. The erection girder was then moved forward and the jacking system raised to reoeive the next unit. The whole sequence was W repeated each fQrtnight. The trestles were erected in the same manner as the box units, the * trestle head being held on a. pivot and the feet lowered on to the a- 18-inch diameter spherical bear- Sa ing pad. The most difficult operation cl of the contract came when the m bridge was extended from one bank to give a free cantilovered of section of 273 feet with an 11 f feet deflection at the end. Work a. was Ipaintained round the clock U3 until three of the main cable m strands were attached in order - to give some protection against over-stressing of the steelwork. All external surfaces of steel- work were given weather protec- tion by grit blast and metal w spraying followed by one coat to of etch primer and zinc chro- e mate,. one undercoat and a til finishing coat of micaceous iron ol ore paint. The last three coats m of protective treatment were pi omitted from the deck surfaces, to which received a mastic asphalt. it wearing coat, Internal protec. ai tion of the boxes consisted of m wire brushing and two coats of bi red lead paint. In The methods of construction involved have enabled the cost pi of the bridge to be kept under pi Â£5 per square foot. p1",

   "text_content" : "'By D. H. CLARE CONTRACTS MANAGER, RICHARD COSTAIN (CIVIL ENGINEERING) LIMITED 1 The four-level Interchange between the M4 and MS at Almondsbury In Gloucestershire. At Almondsbury, five miles to the south-east of the Severn Bridge, Britain's first high-speed interchange between two motor- ways will shortly open. Unique in Europe, this four-level com- plex will link the M4 (London- South Wales) with the future MS (Birtmingham-Somerset). From here traffic will sow south and east along the M4 to- wards the borders of Gloucester- shire or south-westwards along the MS motorway towards Bristol. It was estimated that in 1980 traffic between Bristol and South Wales will have increased by 250 per cent. compared with the 1960 figures and, therefore, the inter. change at Almondsbury was designed for 1980 -peak traffic conditions. When the Severn Bridge pro- ject was planned it was thought that a roundabout at-Almonds& bury connecting the trunk roads would be sufficient. However, with the decision to build motor- ways the roundabout had-to give way to a high-speed interchange. In addition to a 3-evel rounda- bout, the possibilities of-a clover- leaf were also studied. Both failed to meet all the necessary requirements. The Almondsbury interchange has no sharp corners and no points of conflict--as in round- abouts. There are four road levels, and the complex is 65 feet high, the lowest level being 30 feet below ground. Traffic on the M4 will travel straight through on the second tier. The M5 is routed through the first tier, but until this road is extended southwards from Strensham, traffic on the M5 through the interchange will be confined to slip roads.. The upper slip roads will carry traffic turn- ing right from the M4 to the M5. The motorist wanting to reach the M4 from the M5 will use the slip roads beneath these three tiers. The slip roads are designed for motoring at 45 miles per hour. Work on the construction of the motorways linking Bristol with the Severn Bridge began in September, 1963. In addition to the interchange and 16 over- bridges and underpasses, it has involved some six miles of motorway, five and a-half miles of slip and service roads and the widening of two miles of an existing dual carriageway. The project has been carried out by Richard Costain (Civil Engineer- ing) under three contracts worth approximately Â£5m. Asphalt and Public Works undertook a small contract for surfacing. In the low-lying countryside close to the Severn Bride the M4 motorway crosses the alluvial plains. Work in the late summer of 1963 was concentrated on laying some 456 lifeal yards of flood culverts and placing about 360,000 cubic yards of fill material in surcharge embank. ments. Major Problem One of the major problems was encountered when it came to compacting the material excavated by ripper in the cut tings. This was due to the nature of the material and its low moisture content. Although plastic by definition, it con- formed more to the characteri- stics of rock, and to achieve the air void specification .for plastic materials it was necessary to break this rock-like substance into fle particles. Various methods and types of plant were investigated, the most practical solution being multiple pssiss with arid rollers. During the latter stages of excavation in the very dry materials at the base of the cuttings it was found that-contrary to generally accepted practice-the most effective compactor was an 8*- ton vibrating roller. The extreme hardness of the material also created difficulties in achieving the final formation tolerances for the motorway. f. The fact that it was so dry posed a dust problem which meant a change from tar seal to poly- thene sheet to provide a water- proof membrane to the under- side of the road. Steel Tubes From the outset, it was realised that the key to the net- work at Almondsbury was the completion of the four4evel bridge itself. A critical path pro- gramme detailing each day's operations was brought into ser- vice. By strictly controlling the work to this programme, it was possible to analyse and remedy the effects of any delays, thus ensuring that the main resources were concentrated on. the critical operations necessary to achieve the earliest completion date. The span of the bridge decks are 130 feet on the MS, 300 feet on the M4 and 410 feet on the upper slip roads. They are sup. ported on reinforced concrete abutments and 35 columns formed of steel tubes filled with mass concrete of 10,000 pounds per square inch strength. ' In all, the figures for the three contracts show that over 3m. cubic yards of material were ex- cavated, including 140,000 cubic yards of rock; and that 2#m. cubic yards of filling material were placed, of which 500,000 cubic yards had to be trans- ported by a fleet of 200 lorries over average hauls of four miles. By using their own computer bureau, Costain were able to cal. culate the volume of material excavated at the Almondsbury 100-acre site in 2f man-weeks. This was a particularly involved operation due to the unusual shape of the excavations and would have taken three man- months to produce a less accurate figure by conventional methods at nearly three time the cost.",
