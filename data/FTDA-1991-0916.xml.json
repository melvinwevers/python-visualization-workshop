   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By William Keeling THE Bank of Credit and Commerce International defrauded Nigeria of up to $200m (Â£118m) between 1985 and 1987, clients and officials of the bank have said. Executives in BCCI's London office co-ordinated a variety of frauds with the connivance of colleagues in BCCI-Nigeria working for the affiliate under a management contract. A London-based commodity trader who traded with Nigeria and who held his account with BCCI was paid $6m to maintain his silence after incurring losses as result of fraud, according to a BCCI official. The commodity trader, who has asked not to be named, confirmed that a payment was made to him by BCCL BCCI officials say the profit from a complex series of frauds was divided between the bank and the employees involved. One senior executive, accord- ing to a BCCI official, boasted: \"All our star performers are millionaires. No other bank can claim so many millionaires under one roof.\" BCCI officials estimate the bank made an illegal profit of $1SOmn4200m between 1965 and 1987, but add that the frauds probably started in 1982. The Central Bank of Nigeria said the country's authorities were not aware of the issue but would be looking into its books for evidence of fraud. One fraud depended on the fact that the central bank, which had a near monopoly in foreign exchange transactions because of the country's large oil sales, could take up to six months to process letters of credit and make foreign cur- rency available. According to the commodity trader, whose company was registered in Jer- sey before it went into liquida- tion in 1988, this is how it worked: BCCI would issue a letter of credit for, say, the export to Nigeria of vehicle spare parts. Because of the delay in pro- cessing the foreign exchange, BCCI would ask both the Nigeria Importer and the for- eign exporter, without the knowledge of the other, for Gates's hearing starts today Mr Robert Gates, US presl- dent George Bush' cholce sa director of the Cmalral InteNl- gence Agency, faces tough questioning on the Iran-Con- tra affair and the BCCI acan- del at conflnrmaton hearing before the Senate Intelleence Commttee. Page 4 interest payments on the money advanced for the pur- chase during the waiting period before the foreign cur- rency was made available. The fraud depended on the ability of BCCI to conceal from the Nigerian authorities, the fact that it was charging inter- est twice over on the same let- ter of credit. If it had found out, the central bank would have refused to convert the Nigerian customer's interest payment into hard currency. In a more serious and com- plex fraud, BCCI officials have confirmed that a secret account was operated within BCCI-Nigeria by top executives in London without the know- ledge, the officials insist, of local Nigerian staff. Expatriate managers fed a substantial portion of local cur- rency profits made by BCCI-N into this secret account. They then siphoned the money off to London through several cus- tomers' accounts, without the knowledge of the account hold- ers. They pretend that the transfers were bona fide inter- est payments, which the Niger- Ian authorities would agree to convert into foreign currency. Once the funds reached Lon- don, the fraudsters were able to use the money for their own benefit. In addition, the secret account was used to hold funds made by BCCI-N when exploit- ing the difference between the ocial and the black market exchange rate for the naira. In periods during the 1980s, the black market exchange rate for the Nigerian currency was Continued on Page 18 Nigeria hit ContinudromPwl over two times the oiclal rate. The bank was able to exploit this difference because some of its clients wanted illegally to repatriate personal funds to London, without the know- ledge of the Nigerian authori- ties. These clients were told by expatriate executives that the transfer would be possible, but only at the black market rate. In a typical de' the client would, say, pay BCCI-N aira 1,000 and receive in his London account $500. BCCI-N execu- tives would keep the naira 1,000 in their secret account and then conduct a fraud through which they would receive permission from the central ank to transfer the money to London at the aicial exchange rate. This would them $1000, twice the um y had Initially paid the BCCI-N cuent. CC and their officials would pocket the difference. The Ngierlan central bank would make foreign exchange available for the transfer after BCCI.N executives claimed the sums involved were client interest payments on letters of credit. The central bank would ask for only an oral assurance from the trate executives that the ms were genuine, the BCCI officials say. According to CCI oicials, the Nigerian shareholders became increasingly disen- chanted with the freign man- agment, resulting n the can collation of the management contract at the end of last year. BCCI-N, which was owned 00 per cent by Nigerian share- holders and 40 per cent by BCC, changed Its name in July to African Bank Interas- tional. OCI retains its share-",

   "text_content" : "By Richard Waires TAURUS, the London Stock Exchange's much-delayed set- tlement system is unlikely to be ready by its revised target date of May 19e, according to the man responsible for its introduction. The comments by Mr John Watson, the project director behind Taurus, will anger many in the securities indus- try, who have been working hard to develop their own sysems in preparation for the launch. It is also bed news for investors, because the govern- maent has as it will abolish stamp duty on share transae- tions only when Taurus is Asked last week whether the system would be ready on time, Mr Watson said In the- oty, Yea.

But what it has achieved is that most of the industry has done its basic development work for introduction of the system some time in 19.\" He added: \"I decided not to p=t acntnmnisi into [tte drive it through. Now I'm duchanging tack.\" Rather than set a single target date, the exchange would switch to set- ting a series of Interim targets during the esting of the sys tem, hesaid.

Adshd whnethr de oglml tar- get of May had ever been a realistic one, he said: \"I would reject the suggestion that Ijust picked the date out of the air.\" Barclays, which faces consid- erable systems changes ahead of Taurus because of its vari- ous activities related to the securities business, said the delay would introduce further cost. Mr Watson, a partner in Coo- pen & Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, joined the exchange on secondment two years ago. At that time, the Taurus prect - thought by many to be the most important single development In Lon- don's attempts to remain Europe's leading tnancial cen- tre - was floundering. Differ- eat interest groups in the seca- rtt ids ustry were unable to agree on the system's deign. Mr Watson drove through a compromise within months and brought Taurus off the drawing board. But political legal and technical problems have since plagued the system",

   "text_content" : "A Croat national guardsman races for cover across a street In usoek yesterday By Laura SlIber in Belgrade and Router AIR-RAID SIRENS sounded in Zagreb yesterday amid fears of an attack on the Croatian capi- tal. Earlier federal fighter jets had attacked an important port on Croatia's Adriatic coast. People scrambled for cover as the alert sounded and two federal fighter jets swooped low over the city. A television announcer said: \"There is an air-raid alert in Zagreb. Every- one should go to shelters.\" The Croatian army had ear- lier gone on the offensive against the Yugoslav federal forces, blockading several mili- tary barracks in the republic and capturing General Milan Aksentijevic, the deputy com- mander of the Fifth Army Dis- trict which covers most of Croatia and Slovenia. Croatia's counter-attack appeared to be an attempt to reverse a series of crushing set- backs during the past week. Mr Hans van den Broek, the foreign minister of the Nether- lands, which holds the EC pres idency, warned that \"recen measures taken by Croatia will escalate the conflict and endanger the peace conference in The Hague\". At the same time, Italy i4i Germany appealed to the fed eral army to withdraw from Croatia to avoid \"an all-out war\". In a joint statement they said the current number o observers should be increased to 1,000 or more. Mr Mark Eyskens, Belgium': foreign affairs minister, said that Yugoslavia should be frc zen out of all international organisations if the federa army did not withdraw. Mr Zvonimir Separovic, tn: foreign minister of Croatia yesterday threatened to with- draw Croatia from the EC peace conference by Thursday if the fighting continued to worsen. He said the EC could not build a \"new Yugoslavia which is dead\". He also criticised the EC at a news conference yes- terday for comparing Croatian defence measures with the aggression by Serbia and the federal army. Zagreb radio said 15 army barracks surrendered after Croat forces stopped delivery of food and supplies to military installations. Electricity, water and telephone lines were cut off at the weekend. They said Croatia had seized thousands of tonnes of arms, more than 400 military person- nel had surrendered and some other army buildings had been taken elsewhere in Croatia.

   "text_content" : "By POeIe Norman, Economics Correspondent MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has held out the prospect of Britain returning to growth rates in line with previ- ous trends following the reces- sion. In an interview with the Financial Times, he rejected suggestions that British mem- bership of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System would result in subdued growth. \"I will not accept and do not believe that we have to have a low rate of growth perma- nently because of our member- ship of the ERM,\" he said. \"What we have to do is improve the working of the economy, battle with supply side reforms, the housing mar- ket, all these areas. Growth doesn't come from demand management, it comes from the performance of industry and the performance of indus- try is immeasurably improved.\" Although the chancellor said he expected Britain's annual inflation rate to fall below that of Germany later this year, he hesitated to predict a drop in UK interest rates below Ger- man levels. \"For all the tempo- rary difficulties of the German economy, I believe that they are extremely strong and will continue to be strong,\" he said. \"And it is idle to think that interest rate policy can be for- mulated without regard to other currencies including the D-Mark\". But Mr Lamont said real, inflation-adjusted interest rates in Britain were not out of line with those of other European countries while nominal rates were close to the average of the last decade, \"during which time the economy grew at a very fast rate indeed\". \"I see no reason why we should have a niggardly rate of growth in the medium term.\" The chancellor said he was \"increasingly confident\" that the UK economy would recover from recession in the current half year. \"I think we are at or around the turning point.\" \"I think there has already been a very considerable change in confidence and per- ception as to the imminence of recovery,\" he said. He pre- dicted that the Conservative party \"will win the election, whenever it is\". Recent developments in the Continued on Page 18 Election chances, Page 18 Monday Interview.

Britain had managed \"to change the climate and the atmosphere\" in the past nine months in the Emu negotia- tions.

Mr Skubiszewski, who yes- terday postponed a scheduled visit to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, said he would travel once \"mutual relations includ- ing treatment of national minorities has been drafted\". The Polish government wants Poles in Lithuania to be granted citizenship as of right and not on the basis of a loy- alty declaration Vilnius is planning to demand. The rebuff by the Polish gov- ernment was the first public criticism by another country of Lithuania's poor human rights record since its independence last month. Meanwhile, in the neigh- bouring republic of Estonia, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, announced an eco- nomic aid package of $14m (Â£8.2m) for the Baltics. This is the first concrete western aid package to have been offered to the Baltic states. Mr Baker, who held talks in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, with Mr Arnold Ruutel, the Estonian president, and Mr Edgar Savisaar, the prime min- ister, had agreed to review the Start, CFE and INS weapons agreements in light of the Bal- tic states' new status. Mr Skubiszewski made his remarks after a Polish delega- tion from Warsaw last week failed to secure a firm declara- tion in a Lithuanian-Polish draft document that minorities either side of the border would not be forced to assimilate. Under pressure from hard- line nationalists, the Lithua- nian parliament disbanded after September 4 Polish-domi- nated local councils in rural districts near Vilnius and Sole- czniki. The Lithuanian authori- ties had accused the leader- ships of the councils of supporting the coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev.",

But western diplomats and Croat officials believe these tactics are too late to prevent the republic from being further carved up. EC monitors added yesterday that this strategy could undermine the EC-spon- sored peace conference. MACEDONIA A At the same time, Serb par- military units, backed by thei federal army, are moving closer towards achieving the* goal: control of the Adriatic which forms the western flank of Croatia. The federal air force yesterday bombed the indus- trial port of Ploce. These forces are also attempting to win control over Vukovar, and Osijek, a Croat- inhabited city in the east of the republic. If these two goals are achieved, a swathe of territory stretching across from the east- emrn, central and south-western parts of Croatia will form the basi of a Greater Serbia. \"It [the federal army) is try- ing to crush our indepen- dence,\" a former adviser to Mr FranJo TudWman, the president of Croatia, said yesterday. As Serbia pushes forward, Croat officials believe the fed. eral army is fulfilling a plan drawn up as early as spring last year. In early 1990, Slovenia and Croatia were preparing for their first free democratic elec- tions for over 45 years. Those elections were held against a background of calls by Croats and Slovenes for more indepen- dence from the federation. Moves towards independence galvanised the communist fed- eral army and administration, whose existence depended on a federal Yugoslavia. The first step in preventing Slovenia and Croatia from asserting their independence was made on April 17 1990, when the federal army secretly ordered the transfer of all weapons held by the Territo- rial Defence Units (TDUs) to the local federal army bar- racks. The TDUs had been set up by the late President Josip Tito in 1968 partly to abolish the federal army's monopoly. Although the TDUs were financed and controlled locally the commanders had all served in the federal army and been indoctrinated into accepting the territorial integrity of the federation. By April 1990, the federal army feared that the TDUs in Croatia and Slovenia would evolve into republic armies and be deployed to defend the new governments which were elected in April and May respectively. But when Mr Milan Kucan, the president of Slovenia, learned through a local com- mandant about the federal army's plans to disarm the TDUs, he ordered it to be stopped. In all, the army had managed to confiscate only 40,000 weapons held by Slo- venia's TDU units. Because the federal army failed to disarm Slovenia, Slo- venes could defend themselves after their declaration of inde- pendence on June 25. Croatia, however, faced a dif- ferent situation. Unlike Slovenia, which is almost ethnically homogenous, 12 per cent of Croatia's 4.5m population is Serb. Since the Second World War Serbs had played a prominent role in Croatia's interior, security and defence structures. A Yugoslav federal army soldier helps a wounded comrade ater neavy ngnung with roatian forces in the east of the republi yesterday When the order was issued to disarm the Croatian TDUs, the Zagreb government was in no position to resist. More than 200,000 light weapons were handed into federal army bar racks. Thus Croatia, when it declared independence on June 25, could not defend itself. Moreover, the federal army did not disarm Serbs in Kraj- ina, a region south-west of Croatia which declared auton- omy from the republic earlier this year. The federal army also shipped weapons from Serbia across the river Danube to Serbs in eastern Slavonia. Western diplomats in Bel- grade agree that Croatia can- not defend itself against the Serb-dominated federal army and Serb paramilitary units. They add that even if the army and Serbia carve a greater Serbia out of Croatia, this is unlikely to halt their territorial ambitions. Already, the central republic of Bosnia- Hercegovina, which also com- plied with the order to hand in weapons, is vulnerable. \"The only way to stop this aggression is for the EC to send many, many more moni- tors, not only to Croatia, but to Bosnia-Hercegovina,\" said Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy prime minister of Bosnia. \"We will need to defend ourselves, otherwise we will face a terri- ble bloodbath,\" he added.",

   "text_content" : "By Leyli Boulton in Moscow THE top decision-making body in what is left of the Soviet Union is expected today to grapple with tough decisions on who will manage the falter- ing economy and how to sal- vage some kind of economic union. The State Council, bringing together President Mikhail Gorbachev and republic lead- ers, is due to consider a resig- nation request from Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian prime minister, who wants to give up the chairmanship of the emer- gency committee which is run- ning the Soviet economy. Mr Gorbachev has nomi- nated his associate, Mr Arkady Volsky, to replace Mr Silayev as committee chief, while republican leaders, fearingr Russia is proving too asser- tive, may have their own ideas on who should take the job. But many, including Mr Vol- sky, who is said to be a reluc- tant candidate, fear that with- out a Russian Federation official at the helm the com- mittee could lose any power it has. This could mean the coun- cil may convince Mr Silayev to stay or appoint another offi- cial from the republic, which has become the main power in the land. Also on the agenda will be the three blueprints for an eco- nomic union, presented by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the radical economist who is the commit- tee member responsible for economic reform, Prof Stani- slav Shataein, and Mr Yevgeny Saburov, Russian economics minister. Continuing debate about strategy suggests that practi- cal problems will continue to be neglected. On Friday Mr Vladimir Raevsky, the Soviet first deputy finance minister, told the committee that the union budget deficit could come to Rbs144bn Â£48bn - or almost six times a planned tar- get of Rbs27bn. If credits granted by the USSR State Bank were included, he said, the deficit could exceed Rbs2OObn. Mr Raevsky in part blamed the refusal of the Baltic repub- lics, Georgia and Ukraine to contribute to the central bud- get, as well as reduced contri- butions by others. But he was sharply rebuked by Mr Silayev, who told him to find ways of cutting expenditure. Union budget revenues had been set at Rbs250.lbn for 1991, with expenditure at Rbs276.8bn. But there is no doubt the republics themselves also have some belt-tightening to do, even if few politicians want to raise unpopular issues of this kind, let alone hammer out an austerity programme. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, a Soviet economist who took part in drawing up Prof Shat- alin's 500-day plan last year, estimates the combined deficit of republic budgets - which are separate from the Union budget - could total Rbsi20bn-Rbsl25bn this year."

The mood of participants in Kiev's largest demonstration this year was summed up by a placard which declared: \"Nine minus One. Ukraine says no to the all-Union Treaty.\" This was a reference to the agreement by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and repub- lican leaders, signed shortly after the coup failed, to work in a loose confederation. The meeting ended with a list of demands. Chief among them was the proposal that the Ukrrainian govermnent press for immediate international recognition, rather than wait for the result of the December 1 republican referendum to rat- ify the Ukrainian parliament's August declaration of indepen- dence. Another was that all nuclear weapons in the Ukraine be dis- mantled under international supervision. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is expecting the Ukraine to hand over all its mobile nuclear mis- siles to Russia. These demands signal a radi- calisation of Rukh, the pro-in- dependence mass movement which organised the meeting and increased its power in the parliament last week. Rukh now seems prepared to oppose any form of Soviet political union.",

   "text_content" : "Germany's strong private-sector industry must change before Europe can, writes Charles Leadbeater ON a clear day Schwelgern blast furnace at Duisburg you 4 -a can see half the THE German steel EUROPEAN industry blast MARKfE furnaces stretched out like sentinels along the Rhine. The blackened, towering structures of Thyssen's Duis- burg complex is the heart of a century-old alliance between the German steel industry and the manufacturing industries it serves. On one 12km-square site, Thyssen makes as much steel as British Steel produces from three plants. About half Thyssen's domestic customers are within 100km of the plant. Yet, to executives at other European steel companies, the strength in depth of the Ger- man steel industry is one of the chief obstacles to the Europe-wide restructuring needed to give the industry a more stable future. In France, Italy and the UK the industry has been rational- ised largely by the state, with huge helpings of subsidy. Pub- lic ownership brought private steel producers together to cre- ate dominant national produc- ers - Usinor Sacilor in France, British Steel, and lva in Italy. In Germany, where the pri- vate market has prevailed, mergers and acquisitions have made less headway. The indus- try is still dominated by Thys- sen and Hoesch, Krupp and Mannesmann. There has been great change in the German industry. Senior executives at Thyssen recall ioining the industry in the 1960s, when there were more than 30 German steel produc- crs. Employment in steel fell from 344,000 in 1974 to about 170,000 this year. But, as a senior British Steel executive says: \"Germany is the heart of the European industry. It will be very diffi- cult to get change in Europe without change in Germany.\" There is still scope for rationalisation within national industries: AHV and Ensidesa, the Spanish steel groups, are discussing a merger and, in Italy, Ilva is pursuing joint ventures with private steel pro ducers such as Falck. However, most steel execu tives believe the industry will only gain stability if there are fewer producers, with greater financial balance, built on a wider European base. Will the current downturn in steel demand promote such a restructuring, or will it usher in a round of covert state sub- sidy and cartelisation designed to keep the industry's national- istic structure intact? Pressure is building up on both sides. Senior officials at the German steel federation warn that \"a new round of covert subsidies is a real threat\". Executives at Ilva say the main threat is \"a destruc- tion of markets as producers go for volume with no regard for price\". The privately owned produc- ers - Thyssen, Hoogovens, British Steel - are alarmed by the recent deal in which Credit Lyonnais, the French state- owned bank, paid FFr2.5bn (Â£250m) for a 10 per cent stake in Usinor, and by lva's request for more funds from IRI, the state holding company. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive of ASW, the British steel and wire producer, claims prices in continental Europe are not sus- tainable unless producers are being supported by state aid or subsidy no long permitted by the European Commission. The industry is very capital- intensive, requiring huge investments over long periods. Yet it makes a commodity product which can suffer wild swings in demand. However, it seems unlikely that this downturn will pro- voke a crisis to compare with that of the 1970s, when the industry continued to add capacity even though demand fell sharply after the first oil urice rise in 1974. Neither problem is so big now. Additional capacity is Deing created by making better use of existing plants, rather than by building new ones. The producers are acting more swiftly to cut costs. Hoo- govens plans to reduce costs by 15 per cent over the next four years and even nva, which is the most troubled of the big European producers, hopes to An 8 4 0 -4 -8 Iron and Steel production Annual Dercentaae chanae in EC V~VrU i CYÂ·UY break even this year, compared with a $1.6bn (Â£940m) loss in the last recession. First moves towards cross- border technical collaboration have taken place, but collabo- ration to encourage rationalisa- tion is still rare. Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the largest European steel group, believes the downturn will not be intense enough to force radical change. However, a set of sac tors will promote change in the medium run: S Publicly-owned steel compa- nies will have to seek alterna five finance for investment as state subsidy becomes less of an option. Companies will have to seek alliances to share the costs of development. By the mid-1990s, more of the industry will be privatised. Mr Mer says ni-Ivatr!nton w lbecomr e scan option for Usinor after the French presidential election in 1995, while Iva has plans for at least partial privatisation that year. * Europe will have to become more open to trade in steel Western producers are coming under pressure from eastern European steel. Both Usinor and Ilva are developing southern European strategies linked to the development or steel industries in Turkey, Greece and, in nva's case, Iran and Algeria. By the end of next year, there should be a new International agreement on steel trade which will further open the EC market. * The European car industry, one of the sector's main cus tomers, will be shaken up in the next few years as Japanese car-makers expand their activi ties in the EC. This could par- ticularly hit suppliers to car companies' which have been least exposed to Japanese com- -petition - Usinor, the main supplier to Renault and Peug- eot, and nva, which supplies 8C uer cent of Flat's steel. - The long products sector, which makes products such as railway tracks and construe lion beams, is a prime candi- date for radical restructuring. Eastern European producers specialise in this area, which accounts for about 60 per cent of their production. It is also the main product made by elec- tric arc mini-mills. This will force companies to adapt. Usi- nor and Arbed of Luxembourg have already formed a joint venture to market long prod- ucts. Thyssen has formed a ioint venture with Beltrame, the Italian mini-mill, to run its Oberhausen works. 0 The EC is becoming tougher on the industry. Sir Leon Brit- tan, competition commissioner, has taken a strict line on state aid and alleged cartels. However, a senior German steel executive warns: \"Compe- tition was never enough alone to rationalise the steel industry - it will need political direc- tion as well.\" As the German economy slows this year, the pressure for cross-border restructuring will grow. But the pace of change will probably be tortu ously slow. As Mr Mer says: \"Steel executives are not stu- old but they can be very stub nora.\"",

   "text_content" : "By Ian Davidson in Paris CHIEF negotiators from the leading industrialised coun- tries say they are now more confident of a successful con- clusion to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks. But the weekend review by the so-called Quadrilateral Group, made up of the US, the EC, Japan and Canada, pro- duced no breakthrough in the negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). And the US dele- gation made clear that it does not now expect the Uruguay Round to be completed by the year-end deadline set by the Group of Seven industrialised countries in July. After their two-day meeting, in Angers in western France, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade rep- resentative, Mr Frans Andries- sen of the European Commis- sion, Mr Eiichi Nakao of Japan and Mr Michael Wilson of Can- ada all agreed they were now more hopeful than at the start of the year. But Mrs Hills said progress in the Gatt talks would depend on reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and she did not expect this to start until next month. Thereafter, she believed, conclusion of the Uruguay Round would need a further four to six months, which would take the negotia- tions well into.1992. Nevertheless, Mrs Hills' remarks were free from the combative tone which has sometimes marked her com- ments on EC policies. After their meeting the four negotiators agreed that events in eastern and central Europe and the Soviet Union made a successful conclusion of the negotiations even more neces- sary than before. But Mr Andriessen admitted that the emergence of new states from within the Soviet Union was creating problems for the world trading system. Mr Andriessen, who came to the quadrilateral meeting straight from a fact-finding mission to the Soviet Union, said it was too soon to take any decisions on how much aid was required or to whom it should be provided, or whether the Soviet Union or its compo- nent republics should become full members of Gatt. * A Japanese-EC car accord places no formal limit on how many vehicles Japanese com- panies can build in the Com- munity, Mr Andriessen said on Saturday. Nor does the pact curb EC imports of Japanese cars built in the US, Renter reports from Angers.",

In his place as interior minis- ter will come Mr Rudolf Sei- ters, currently the minister in the Chancellor's Office, and a Kohl loyalist.

   "text_content" : "George Graham runs the rule over a Demoatic iter from owa, Senator To Harkin DEMOCRATIC party contenders for the US presidential election next year have been unusually slow to put their names for- ward, but Senator Tom Harkin confirmed his supporters' expectations yesterday by for- mally announcing his bid for the party nomination. The Iowan rarely leaves his friends or his enemies in any doubt on where he stands. An aggressive prairie popu- list - sometimes criticised as a demagogue - with strong farming and trade union con- stituencies, Mr Harkin proudly proclaims himself the heir of earlier left-wing Democrats such as the late Vice-President Hubert Humphrey or Mr George McGovern, the party's defeated presidential candi- dates in 1968 and 1972 respec- tively. He also claims lineage, how- ever, from such Democratic presidents as Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt. He argues that the Demo- crats' long losing streak in presidential elections is due to their efforts to look more like Republicans: \"The Democrats must come up with a candidate who is not afraid to stand up for traditional Democratic val- ues.\" On the campaign trail in his home state last week, the sena- tor told his own life story as his version of the American dream: the son of a coalminer father and a Yugoslav immi- grant mother, who paid his way through college with road- building jobs and an army scholarship, and who now sits next to a Rockefeller in the US Senate. The Iowan also recounts the souring of the American dream in the greedy 1980s: the story of his brother Frank, who was sacked from his factory job after V2 years by faceless inves- tors and ended, 54 years old and deaf, cleaning toilets at a shopping mall. His remedy is an interven- tionist programme based on infrastructhral investment - the sort of government con- struction projects that gave his father work in the great depression and helped pay for his education. \"If I am elected president, I will not be fine-tuning Reaganomics, I will put it on the trash heap of history. We will have a new economic pol- icy called resource-based economics,\" he says. He mocks the \"trickle-down\" policies of the Reagan era, arguing for investment at the bottom to be allowed to perco- late up: \"We have had some droughts in Iowa but I have never seen a drought like the one we had waiting for all that stuff to trickle down. There hasn't even been a thin drizzle I would have settled for a heavy dew.\" Mr Harkin has been heavily involved in farm legislation. In 1985 and 1987, he sponsored bills that would have turned the current subsidies system upside down by substituting rigorous supply management. His state depends heavily on farm exports but his ties to the labour movement help to make him one of the most protection- ist members of Congress. He is weak on the specifics of his economic programme, but it is clear where the money would come from. Playing on Iowa's tradition as an isolation- ist and dovish state, he asks: \"Do you want to continue spending $160bn of your money defending Europe against the Soviet Union, or whatever it is called now?\" Mr Harkin put down a marker last week, on the first ^c^'' II%4tjr )SIC Tom Harkin, in front of Old Glory, flourishes a suitcase to make ms point nat ueorge nusn pays too mucn neem To uwran uuz Â·Â· .. *1 . ; ..47 r a~\"' ii IcÂ·c~~ day of the autumn Senate ses- sion, by proposing the transfer of $3.1bn from the defence bud get to health, education, and low-income welfare. This was defeated, but the theme is likely to recur often in the coming year. While seeking the Demo- cratic nomination, Mr Harkin seems likely to embody the party's traditionalist wing against more revisionist candi- dates such as Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who want to get away from the Demc crats' tax-and-spend image, and favour a wider international role for the US. Iowa, because its February caucuses are the first in the US election cycle, usually carries disproportionate weight in the Democratic party selection. Some party officials argue that this has often favoured candi dates on the party's left wing. However, Mr Harkin being from Iowa, the state's choice this year may have less impact. Such potential candi- dates as Senator Bob Kerrey from neighbouring Nebraska could do well in Iowa, but many candidates might well concede the state's delegates to Mr Harkin, especially if popu- lous California, as Democratic officials hope, brings its pri- mary forward to March 3, near the start of the selection cycle. \"I would have to do better here [in Iowa] than anyone ever has,\" he acknowledges. Senator Harkin's self-portrait as the champion of the work- ing man against the patrician incumbent president - whom he rarely fails to label in full as George Herbert Walker Bush - could win popular support outside his home state. His stock of sharp-edged wise- cracks at the president's expense promises to enliven the campaign trail.",

Twelve of the 23 senators have said they will reject a 10-year extension for Subic Bay naval base when they vote today, the day the current lease expires. Approval requires a two-thirds majority. \"I propose we take the issue directly to the people,\" Mrs Aquino said in a national televi- sion address. She had said earlier that such a referendum would probably be held between mid-December and March, after the government had gathered 3m signatures to request a referendum, as required by law. The US forces might delay their departure from the base until the referendum's results were known, though US officials have said they would withdraw as soon as possible if the Sen- ate were to reject a new lease of the base."

   "text_content" : "By Uonel Barber in Washington MR ROBERT Gates, the choice of President George Bush as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency, today will face a political and legal mine- field as he seeks to persuade sceptical senators that he is the right man to be America's spymaster. During confirmation hear- ings before the Senate Intelli- gence Committee, he will be questioned under oath about several big scandals of the 1980s, including the Iran-contra arms-for-hostages affair, illegal arms shipments to Iraq and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Concern that Mr Gates might have been involved in these scandals has already forced a delay of almost four months in the confirmation hearings. Mr Bush has remained solidly behind his nominee, thus raising the polit- ical importance of the nomina- tion. These scandals have over- shadowed the more substan- tive issue of the CIA's future role in a world where the Soviet threat - focus of the agency's energies for more than 40 years - has dimin- ished, and where many outside experts are calling for a reor- ganisation of the CIA and its $30bn annual budget. For Mr Gates, an expert on Soviet affairs who is deputy national security adviser to the president Bush, the hearings will offer a second chance to claim the post he has desired for most of his professional life. A protegd of Mr William Casey, buccaneering CIA direc- tor under President Reagan, Mr Gates was nominated to succeed Mr Casey when he died in 1987. However, he with- drew his nomination amid doubts about his role in, and knowledge of, the Iran-contra scandal. Between 1984 and 1989, Mr Gates served first as deputy director of intelligence, then as deputy director, of the CIA. His occupation of these senior make many believe he would have found it difficult not to have known about the Iran- contra operation. Mr Gates could face difficul- ties if, as expected, retired CIA officers testify to the commit- tee on the operation. One such officer,) Mr Alan Piers, has already implicated higher- ranking CIA officials in a cov- er-up of the Iran-contra affair and in lying to Congress. The extent of Mr Gates's knowledge about the relation- ship between the CIA and BCCI is also expected to sur- face in the confirmation hear- ings. According to Mr William von Raab, former Commissioner of Customs in the US, Mr Gates called BCCI \"the Bank of Crooks and Criminals\". In response to questions by Mr von Raab, investigating BCCI, Mr Gates gave no hint that the CIA was channelling funds for various covert operations - including aid to rebels in Afghanistan - through the bank, which was recently shut down by authorities in various countries after the discovery of widespread fraud. Mr Gates can also expect many questions about the CIA's role in allowing the ille- gal export of ballistic missile equipment and technology to South Africa by International Signal & Control (ISC), the Pennsylvania company at the centre of a scandal uncovered after it had been taken over by Ferranti of the UK. The nominee is also likely to face charges that he manipu- lated intelligence to exaggerate the Soviet threat in the 1980s, which allowed the Reagan's administration to justify its $2,000bn arms build-up. He has often denied these charges. Fears that Mr Gates could be implicated in the Iran-contra affair were the main reason why senators agreed to a delay in the confirmation hearings. Democrats are already consid- ering a delay in a Senate vote so as to force the withdrawal of the nomination. Gates: Into a minefield",

   "text_content" : "By Lara Marlowe in Beirut A SENIOR US diplomat visited Beirut at the weekend for talks which included the issue of western, Arab and Israeli hostages in the Middle East, amid continuing forecasts that the liberation of a western cap- tive in Lebanon was imminent. Mr John Kelly, US assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, who has a his- tory of involvement in hostage negotiations, called on the Lebanese president, prime min- ister and speaker of parlia- ment. It is thought the next west- ern hostage due to be freed in a complex exchange involving Lebanese Shia Moslem groups, Israel, Iran, Syria and the United Nations, will be Mr Jackie Mann, the 77-year-old Briton and former pilot. Meanwhile Mr Farouq al- Sharaa, Syrian foreign minis- ter, travelled to Bonn to address the question of two Lebanese brothers whose free- dom is demanded by hostage- takers. An Israeli newspaper said Mr Uri Lubrani, the chief Israeli hostage negotiator, would meet Mr Javier Pdrez de Cudllar, UN secretary-general, in Paris within a few days. Mr Kelly's visit to Beirut on Saturday followed the depar- ture of his Iranian counterpart, Mr Mohamed Kazem Khonsari, who was said to have visited MR James Baker, US secretary of state, will today tackle an Israeli government seething with resentment arainst President George Bush when he arrives in Jerusalem at the start of a Middle East tour meant to smooth remaining obstacle to a regional peace confer- ence, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.

In cabinet yesterday, far- right ministers demandeid that Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, boycott peace talks until the guaran- tees are approved. Mr Behavam Ze'evi, one of the most extreme ministers, called Mr Bush a liar and close to an anti-semite. the kidnappers as well as the same Lebanese officials called on by Mr Kelly.

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By William Dullforce in Geneva A STRONG challenge to current policy prescriptions which encourage developing countries to give free rein to market forces is launched today by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). In particular, in its annual report the UN organisation which functions as watchdog for the relationship between the industrialised and develop- ing world warns against pre- cipitate financial deregulation. It calls for a new look at the liberal approach to domestic financial reform advocated for developing countries by the World Bank and the Interna- tional Monetary Fund (IMF). In a special section devoted to finance, investment and savings, Unctad's economists claim that fashionable sinan- cial recipes calling for the abandonment of \"financial repression\" are not promoting development. They deny the existence of a global savings shortage; they deplore the ten- dency to introduce in develop- ing countries an \"Anglo-Saxon\" banking sys- tem which gives a central role to capital markets; and they argue that government inter- vention in the allocation of credits is indispensable. Separately, the Unctad report castigates the EC and the US for what it sees as a historical reversal of their lit- eral trade practices at a time when developing countries have been deregulating their trading systems. While the report warns that failure to complete the drag- ging Uruguay Round trade negotiations would dash Third World hopes, it also notes that the current status of the talks promises to provide only lim- ited benefits for developing countries. Controversial as they may be, Unctad's economists insist heir prescriptions for develop- ng countries' financial poll- ies are not purely iconoclas- tc. Thus, Mr Kenneth Dadzie, Unctad's secretary-genera., recognises that developing countries need to upgrade the quality of government inter- vention, if necessary through drastic reforms, and to improve their banking systems by the establishment of invest- ment banks, while Mr Roger Lawrence, head of the team which wrote the report, stresses that the three crucial elements for promoting devel- opment remain domestic macro-economic reform, nego- tiated debt reduction and growth in export earnings. Unctad's 1991 report is a plea for a long-term approach in Third World financial systems rather than the short- termism implicit in simplistic liberalisation recipes, Mr Law- rence says. For the last few years the Unctad annual report has focused on the inadequacies of current programmes for reduc- ing Third World debt. This year the emphasis has shifted. Nevertheless, the secretariat warns that the vicious circle of overindebtedness, domestic financial disorder and low eco- nomic growth persists in many developing countries. Unctad continues to com- plain that the agreements reached under the plan pro- posed by Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, for reducing debts owed to com- mercial banks have resulted in only minor alleviation of the debt burden. It calls for more extensive relief from official debt. While it argues that evalua- tion of the Brady plan agree- ments can only be premature, the 1991 report acknowledges that in Mexico's case the debt agreement has created a \"cli- mate of greater economic con- fidence\" which has led to a return of flight capital and a sharp rise in foreign equity investment. The report welcomes \"bold proposals\" from the Nether- lands and the UK for relieving the debt burden of the poorest, mainly African countries. It touches a sensitive point within the developing world when it asks that the \"extraor- dinarily large\" debt forgive- ness agreed by creditors for Poland and Egypt be applied to middle-income developing countries on the basis of \"objective economic criteria, not political preferences\". But the thrust of the 1991 report concerns Third World finance and the efficiency of financial markets. Dismissing \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t the premise that there is a shortage of. global savings, Unctad's economists claim there is tse to curb Smiltaryn g tbat house- o hold ivelnot in real- ity beet and that the cost of ivestment goods is falling sharply thanks to rapid technical progress. Most importantly, they argue that as long as world production potential is not being fully utilised, invest-j ment can be stepped up through increased bank lend- ing without governments and households having first to cut their consumption, since the investment itself would create savings by generating addi- tional income. In this context Unctad approves a Japanese proposal for a new $20bn (Â£11.8bn) allocation of Special Drawing Rights through the IMF to be linked to develop- ment finance. A.afling for closer examina- tiof of the financial policies pursued by the developing countries themselves, the Unctad report argues that the liberal approach backed by the IMF and World Bank - dere- gulation of interest rates, elimination of directed credit allocation and easing of restrictions on external inance - has not succeeded in lifting domestic savings and investment. In successful developing countries such as South Korea governments con- inued to intervene directly in capital markets, pursued active industrial policies and directed credits. In particular, the Unctad economists argue that the \"Anglo-Saxon\" model of short-term bank lending and long-term financing through capital markets carries greater dangers for developing coun- tries than the Japanese or Ger- man bank-based systems.

   "text_content" : "A TTHE age of 78 many / a distintuished Jaipa n onee Industrialist would be happy to spend moast of his time on the golf course. Not Mr Elii Suzuki. He has just spent two months doing one of the most difficult jobs of his long career - preparing plans for reform- ing Japans ancial markets in the wake of the recent spate of scandals in the securities and banking industries. As chairman of a reform committee appointed by Mr Toshiki Kaifu, prime minister, Mr Suzuki had to tread a diffi- cult path between officials at the Ministry of Finance, who fought to defend their powers, and the ministry's critics, who argued the ministry itself was in need of overhaul. The two sides lobbied Mr Suzuki and his committee until the last moment, delaying pub- lication of the report by half a day as clerks tried to draft a final version. The key argu- ment concerned proposals for a watchdog organisation to take over from the Finance Ministry the inspection of securities and banking. Reformists, including some maembers o Mr Suzuki's com- mittee, insisted the new body should be independent, like the US Securities and Exchange Commission. But ministry off- das said the watchdog should e incorporated inside the Miin- The committee has settled on a compromise - a watch- dog which will be separate from the ministry but report- ing to the finance minister. To be called the Securities and rinancial Inspection Commis- sion, it will have investigative powers over financial compa- nies and investors and the power to confiscate documents. But it will not have the right to impose punishments; that will stay with the finance min- ister. The minister will nomi nate the commission's mem- bers, but will be barred from appointing present or past Finance Ministry officials. Critics say the Finance Min iatry has won and managed to keep its authority intact, since it will not lose the right to pun- ish wrongdoers. Mr Suzuki argues he has produced a workable solution - a watch iog which \"is separate from he ministrybut ble to' com- -unicatewith it\". Looking tired from bis efforts, he adds: \"In Jan wire have a saying that a dicut Dirth produces a healthy baby.\" Stefan Wagstyl on the difficult course charted by Eiji Suzuki Mr Suzuki is the former pres- ident and former chairman of Mitsubishi Kasei, the chemi- cals company and core member of the Mitsubishi industrial grouping. He is now the com- pany's senior adviser. He has held senior posts at Japanese employers organisa- tions since 1975, including the presidency of Nikkeiren, the Japanese Federation of Employers' Associations. Mr Suzuki is a firm believer in free markets, a principle he wants to see applied more extensively in Janpn's sinan- clal system. He argues that for too long the Finance Ministry has pampered financial compa- nies, putting promotion of the financial industry ahead of the need for open and fair regula- tion and investor protection. \"We need to make a liberal- ised market in which financial companies are free to go bank- npt,\" he says. The Finance Ministry needs to set clear rules for the opera- tion of the markets and then stand back. It should supervise at arm's length and should rely on full and frank disclosure by financial companies combined with a strong inspection sys- tem to detect wrongdoing, Mr Suzuki believes. In this way market forces would operate more freely within a clear framework of rules. There are risks involved in giving companies more free dom but Japan has to take them, he argues. \"Certainly it is dangerous. But if we go in the opposite direction [of more restrictions and more interfer- ence) we cannot create interna tional markets in line with those in the US and the UK.\" These principles are reflected in Mr Suzuki's report. The committee says it wants to create \"freer, fairer and clearer\" markets. As well as the establishment of the watch- dog, it recommends codifying unwritten ministerial adminis- trative customs into clear rules and regulations. It urges com- panies to assume a greater responsibility for regulating their own affairs - with a requirement for greater disclo- sure to make sure they do. The committee also supports liberalising stock exchange commission rates to force secu- rities companies to compete more fairly for business instead of currying favour with important customers by paying them compensation for trading losses - one of the abuses behind the current scandals. The report says the scandals, involving compensation for losses, links between securities companies and gangsters, and banks making illegal loans, did not happen by accident. The policies of financial companies and of the Finance Ministry created conditions which allowed abuses to develop.",

   "text_content" : "THE WEEKEND signing by South Africa's main political groupings of an accord aimed at curbing violence marks the beginning in earnest of the coun- try's peace negotiations, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg The accord is by far the most signifi- cant multilateral agreement signed by the government, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party. Although violence in Transvaal townships provided a sober backdrop, the pact has been welcomed by most South Africans in euphoric terms. Arch- bishop Desmond Tutu described it as a \"historic day, quite unparalleled in the annals of our land\". Political violence has been the single most divisive issue in South Africa over the past year. But the accord has lined up all the main protagonists on the same side, in favour of peace. The com- mitment to principles of liberal democ- racy and the nascent power sharing that the accord emoraces have aiso given it resonance far beyond the issue of violence. The main features of the accord are:. * A code of conduct for the police which holds them accountable to soci- ety, not the government. * A code of conduct for political par- ties which commits them to upholding a climate of political tolerance. * A network of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, under a peace committee, to help implement the accord at grassroots level. * Independent structures to address complaints about security force con- duct. * An independent statutory commis- sion to investigate and expose causes of violence. * Special courts to expedite handling of political violence cases. * Measures to assist socio-economic reconstruction at the local level.",

   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0916_0007_001",
   "text_content" : "By RaIph Atkins LABOOR will today argue that a real economic recovery will come' only when unemploy- ment falls, as the party increases its efforts to return domestic policy to the political FolloMwing Labour's slide in weekend opinion polls, Mr Nell Kinnock, party leader, and Mr John Smith, shadow chancel- lor, will seek to puncture Con- servative optimism over the economy and again call for a November general election. They will argue that a full recovery may not materialise until 1993. Mr Smith said yesterday that speculation over the election date was disrupting the econ- omy. Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, told TV-am that he was becoming increasingly persuaded of the case for fixed- term parliaments because of the uncertainty created by speculation. Party strategists are relying increasingly on a switch of attention to domestic issues to revive the party's standing in opinion polls - a message likely to be reinforced when the shadow cabinet meets tomorrow for the first time since before the summer. On BBC radio, Mr Smith joined other Labour leaders in trying to present an unruffled front. Speculation over election dates \"doesn't help the man- agement of the economy, or the proper ordering of our affairs\", he said. \"So if the Con- servatives are so confident about it, I think they should have the election now.\" Mr Smith's speech today in Newcastle upon Tyne will set out Labour's definition of a \"real\" economic recovery. Recovery must imply a return to the position before the reces- sion began, he will argue, for example by sustaining an annual growth rate trend of about 2% per cent. \"Real recovery is at the very least when the level of unem- ployment begins to fall And real recovery is only durable when levels of investment, ticularly in manufacturin, start climbing again,\" he say. Citing forbcasts from the National Institute for Ecd- nomic and Social Research and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, he will argue that \"it is quite clear that a full recovery from the recession would be far from secure even by the end of 1992\". Mr Kinnock will tell the West Midlands Confederation of British Industry that under the Tories a recovery would be consumer-led, leading to a third recession if the govern- ment were elected for a fourth term. Labour's alternative would be an investment-led recovery to overcome skills shortages and beat inflation.",

   "article_dc_title" : "Voting Reform Pressure Grows",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0916_0007_002",
   "text_content" : "By Philip Stephens, Political Editor PRESSURE on the Labour party to include abolition of the first-past-the-post voting system in its plans for consti- tutional reform will intensify today with the publication of a report by an influential think tank. The left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research calls in its report for a fundamental shift in the balance of political power in Britain, with a writ- ten constitution replacing par- liament as the ultimate source of authority. Its call, which will be reinforced at a conference in London later this week, co- incides with moves in the Labour party to ensure that the debate on electoral reform is a central part of its confer- ence in Brighton next month. .With Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, again trailing in the opinion polls, advocates among his senior colleagues of a move to embrace propor- tional representation are confi- dent that their case can no lon- ger be brushed aside. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health spokesman, has already claimed that a commitment to electoral reform by Labour is now only a matter of time. The institute, many of whose leading figures have close asso- ciations with the Labour party, sets out its list of radical reforms in what it calls a draft constitution running to 129 articles and six schedules. Apart from its calls for an end to the supremacy of parlia- ment and for the abolition of the royal prerogative, it demands a bill of rights, an elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords, and the introduction of fixed- term parliaments. The constitution envisages the devolution of political nower to elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and 12 English regions. But it is the call for the replacement of the current sys- tem for voting MPs into the House of Commons by the additional member system that will attract most interest in Labour ranks. It will increase the pressure on Mr Kinnock to adopt a more radical stance on reform, perhaps by promising a form of constitutional confer- ence immediately after the general election. It will also be seized upon by Mr Paddy Ash- down, Liberal Democrat leader, as evidence that pressure for change among opposition par- ties has become unstoppable. The additional member sys- tem, a hybrid that assigns some votes to parties and some to individual constituencies, would allow the House of Commons to maintain close links between MPs and their constituencies, but would dis- tribute seats much more pro- portionately to the number of votes cast for each party. It has already been studied closely by an independent com- mittee under Professor Ray- mond Plant of Southampton University charged by Mr Kin- nock with studying the impli- cations of electoral reform.

   "text_content" : "Philip Stephens on history's lessons for the timing of the election I T IS at times like this in the electoral cycle that Iprime ministers tiurni the history books. The lessonsi for Mi John Major are deciledly awkward.. The publication of two more opinion polls yesterday show- ing the Conservatives with a lead over Labour of four to five points intensified the spoculaW tion that he will be tempted into a November poll. The truth is that neither he nor his most trusted advisers have made up their minds. That in itself is significant. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, spent much of the weekend telling television viewers that his long-standing preference for a 1992 poll was as valid as ever. His theme was that, if the promise of eco- nomic recovery had brought such a strong revival in Tory fortunes, why not wait for the reality to reinforce the trend during the next six months? It is a judgment shared by many in the most senior ranks of the cabinet, notably Mr Nor- man Lamont, the chancellor. One of Mr Major's close confi- dants could point yesterday only to Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, as an enthus- iast for November. Yet there is no doubt that the mood of optimism among the voters that has reversed Labour's lead in the polls has also begun to infect the cabi- net. Six weeks ago one senior minister gave odds of 100 to 1 against an election this year. Yesterday the most he would say was that a November poll was \"not probable, not at all probable - but possible\". Conservative Central Office has dusted off its contingency plans to transform the public- ity campaign which opens this week - long-planned as a pre- cursor to the party conferences - into a full-scale election bat- tle plan. Ministers have been as sur- prised as anyone at the speed of the turnaround since July. They thought then that the summer lull in politics might add the traditional two or three points to the govern- ment's standing, leaving it neck-and-neck with Labour. No one predicted it would have a significant lead; or that sup- port for Labour would sink below 40 per cent. Recent headlines have tended to focus on the nersonal tenedfousonth prsna Past imperfect: Harold Wilson, left, moved too early in 1970, while James Callaghan dithered and delayed in 1978 lead that Mr Major has estab- lished over Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, in the rat ings, but the most surprising, and encouraging, signs for the government have come from the poll evidence on the econ omy. The NOP survey published in The Independent on Sunday on September 8 gave the clear est indication of the trend. Vot- ers said they had become markedly more optimistic about the outlook for their financial position over the next year. As importantly, the number who thought that the Conser- vatives rather than Labour would deliver the prosperity jumped equally sharply. Mr Major is as convinced as any- one that elections are won and lost on the economy. The problem is that a four- point or five-point lead is not enough to be sure of winning, particularly when it follows a period in which the voters have been particularly febrile. In 1970 Mr Harold Wilson made exactly that mistake, when he was persuaded by a batch of favourable opinion polls to bring forward the elec- tion from October to May. The lead vanished during the cam- paign, letting Mr Edward Heath into Downing Street. Mr Patten will be telling Mr Major that unless the gap with Labour widens significantly over coming weeks - and Tory support moves from its present level of between 40 per cent and 42 per cent to 44 per cent to 45 per cent - history could well repeat itself. The gloss of the prime minis- ter's recent globe-trotting could easily fade during an election campaign fought on domestic issues. With unemployment still climbing sharply, it is uncer- tain for how long the voters will be content with the prom- ise rather than the reality of economic recovery. Mr Major might yet be pun- ished for the recession and the poll tax. Mr Paddy Ashdown's newly confident Liberal Democrats could steal vital votes from the Tories in the south. But there are risks also in delay as Mr Major must have learnt in 1979, the year he entered parliament. Mr James Callaghan had considered an election the pre- vious autumn, but had first dithered and then delayed. The unforeseen - the \"winter of discontent\" - drove him from office. The prime minister, as he looks ahead over the next six months, must wonder whether Europe, the poll tax, rising unemployment - or simply something he has not thought of - might hand the initiative back to Labour. He has already voiced some regrets about not risking an election back in the early summer. He is impatient for his own mandate from the voters. Of course the fog could clear over the next few weeks. If the Conservative lead in the polls has edged down by the time of Labour's conference in Brighton in the first week of October, all talk of a 1991 elec- tion will again evaporate. If, on the other hand, the gap has widened to eight or 10 points, then Mr Major might find it impossible to delay, even if he wanted to. If the polls stay as they are - or perhaps add another point or two to the Tory lead - then his dilemma will become excruciating. The odds are still that in those circumstances he will wait. But, either way, he will find little solace in the history books.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Allson Smith LABOUR is to launch a fresh attack on the local govern- ment spending settlement announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, the enVironment secretary - with claims that his failure to secure enough money from the Treasury will oblige business to bear a don- ble burden to make up the shortfall. The move comes as the Department of the Environ- ment faces pressure from the business community to freeze the uniform business rate next year. Under the legislation that introduced the poll tax and the national non-domestic rate, the most by which the govern- ment can decide to raise the business rate in any financial year is the annual inflation rate at the preceding Septem- ber. For the current year, it was raised by the maximum - 10.9 per cent - and business leaders fear that with next month's figure likely to have fallen to around 4 per cent, the government is certain to increase it to the limit Mr Heseltine announced in July that the aggregate exter- nal finance (AEF) for councils - comprising government grants and the business rate - would be Â£33.1bn in 1992-93, an increase of Â£2.25bn over this year's AEF, including the reduction of up to Â£140 for each person announced in the Budget. Labour says that a business rate increase in line with infla- tion is likely to yield about Â£lbn of that total. Taking into account the extra receipts from the rise in VAT to 17'/ per cent, which financed the Budget reduction in bills and will continue to hit busi- ness, the actual increase in government grant is likely to be no more than Â£750m. \"The fine detail of Mr Heseltine's settlement shows that it is nowhere near as gen- erous as he claims,\" said Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman. \"In addition, it is business and the consumer who are having to pay more to save the govern- ment's face over the poll tax.\""

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "I By Richard Ton*lns, Transport Correspondent STRETCHES of the London Underground may have to close temporarily if the government fails to pump more money into the net- work, London Transport has warned. LT says it may also have to shelve plans for a new Under- ground station to serve the Channel tunnel train terminal being built at Waterloo. The warnings come as the Treasury weighs up competing bids for government cash in the run-up to the Autumn Statement on its public spen ing plans. Ls maintains that it needs to double the rate of investment in the Underground - now running at Â£870m a year - to reverse the deterioration of the network. Its claims received support in June when a report from the Monopolies and Mergers Corn mission blamed deficiencies in Underground services on \"chronic under-investment\" by successive governments. Until now LT has declined tc spell out the consequences if the Department of Transport alils to provide an increase in its grant But senior LT executives are threatening to embarrass the government with such a list if the allocation in this year's -puiblic spending round falls short of its aspirations. Included in the list will be: a speed restrictions and tem- porary track closures caused by the failure of tepairs and eplacements to keep up with the rate of deterioratior; * severe disruption to .er vices caused by deterioration of the track and by flooding from collapsing drains; * shelving of station-moderni sation plans and delays to the replacement of worn-out lifts and escalators; * postponement or cancella- tion of plans to extend and renew the Underground station at Waterloo to serve passen- gers leaving and joining Chan- nel tunnel trains. Senior London Undergroun- executives say they need to spend zÂ£bn before the year 2000 on upgrading the existing infrastructure and a further Â£5bn on the construction of new lines. The government damped hopes of a significant increase in London Transport funding earlier this month in its response to the MMC report. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said: \"It isn't reasonable to expect a quantum jump to be achieved in the short-term future. It isn't realistic.\"",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "Paul Cheeseright on one person's quest to transform the east Midlands landscape charged with a mission. It is to change the land- scape of the centre of England with 30m trees. \"We're not talking about wall-to-wall trees, we're talking about a wooded landscape,\" she says. This is the new national forest, the forest with no name, no land and no money. \"Up to now this has been something of a dream; the practicalities will be much more controversial,\" Ms Bell notes with the coolness of a politician at the start of a cam- paign. For she is now a politi- cian and a diplomat, not to mention a financier, a forestry expert, a lobbyist and an entre- preneur - whether she likes it or not. She was given the job of new national forest development director by the Countryside Commission, the organisation which oversees landscape con- servation for the government. The terms of her new post are more extensive than those usu- ally given to a planner. Town and country planning is Ms Bell's background, both in pri- vate practice and at the Co>. try Landowners' Association. But she has a leavening of pub- lic relations experience, and that comes in handy. Ms Bell's brief is vague: although nothing has been laid down for the forest, there are myriad individual decisions to grow trees. This is vision translation on the cheap. Unlike the developer Mr Paul Reichmann of Olympia & York, who is said to have spent more than Â£lbn in three years to realise his vision of a new office city in London's Dock- lands, Ms Bell has been given Â£350,000 a year for three years. What happens after that depends on what she does now. Over the next six months deci- sions will be taken on where the forest will be, what sources of private and public sector funding might be raised, and what sort of organisation should exist after the current development programme. Midnight oil will burn as business plans, environmental assessment and cost-benefit analysis are honed for public scrutiny. The forest office has been set up in Donisthorpe, Leicester- shire, an undistinguished vil lage close to where Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire meet. The office is in a Victorian house surrounded by some grand trees of its own. It is in the centre of what forest people call the area of search, the area spread over parts of the four counties where the forest boundary will be set. The office sounds more imposing than it is. There are Ms Bell and two assistants. There will be Ms Bell, three- other professionals, three assis tants and a one-day-a-week consultant when the forest team reaches full strength. Again, not exactly Reichmann esque in scale. Until Ms Bell and her team know exactly where they are going and how they are going to get there, there is a hiatus. The plan for a new forest was trumpeted last year. Since then nothing much seems to have happened. \"If there's a silence, people are fearful and rumour is rife,\" says Ms Bell. There are fears in the farming community about what wood lands might mean to them, dark hints about forest people buying land and pushing prices up, and concern that developers will be able to do what they want provided they agree to plant a few trees. So, notes Ms Bell, \"an enor mous part of the job is simply telling people what we are up to\". Like the politician on the road, she spends a great deal of time talking to small groups. One typical day this summer she was in the office before 9am, had a meeting to brief the new regional secretary of the country Landowners' Associa tion, whose support she needs and whose psychology she understands because once she worked for it herself. She fielded some newspaper enquiries, did some paperwork then dashed off across Leices- tershire to meet the county's Rural Development Commis- sion committee before return- ing to the office for some tele- phoning. Out again in the early even- ing to a meeting of the Ram- blers' Association, whose main concern is public access, and whose main worry is about Branch managern Susan Bell in the grounds of her office farmers obscuring footpaths. Ms Bell has done enough of these meetings to be well-re- hearsed. She runs through the his- tory: how the Countryside C*ommission had the dream in 1987, how five possible areas were selected, how the final choice was made, how the prol- ect has government backing, although \"the govemnment has made clear this is not to be a purely public-sector enter- prise\". She tells her audience how Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, describes himself as \"an enthu- siast, but a sceptic\". She explains that the area of search, some 450 square miles, will be narrowed down to the forest area of 150 square miles. As Ms Bell answers ques- tions, she is putting down markers and laying out princi- ples. Above all she is trying to keep happy a number of people and groups with different interests. \"We hope we will be seen as the farmer's ally,\" she tells the RDC committee, while assur- ing the ramblers, some of whom say they have never met a nice farmer yet: \"I would like the whole scheme to be geared towards public access, but that won't be achieved simply by demanding it.\" The area of the Midlands where the forest will be has fewer woods than other parts, and has been scarred by min- eral extraction. And there is more to come - \"British Coal is still buying land in the area,\" she warns. But she does not want the forest to be \"the biggest recla- mation project in the UK\". The forest could help economic regeneration by offering alter- native land uses to hard- pressed farmers, although, Ms Bell concedes, they are scepti- cal. \"What is it that would actu- ally trigger farmers and land- owners putting their land to woodland?\" she asks. The forest can produce tim- ber for commercial use. It can be like an ecological and envi- ronmental school. It will be there for recreation. But it is doubtful whether it can do any of these things without a well-funded organi- sation which, in addition to encouraging others to plant, can itself plant and generate income from it. Ms Bell sees the landscape as a mosaic, a recreational resource which can do other things. To craft that mosaic will take a generation. \"It is going to be a balancing act, but if we cannot accommo- date everybody's interests in 150 square miles of woodlands,"

   "text_content" : "By Lisa Wood, Labour Staff GOVERNMENT rules stipu- lating that only senior execu- tives or chairmen of chief exec- utive status can sit on the boards of Training and Enter- prise Councils (Tecs) are to be eased in a few cases. Tecs which believe there are special reasons for appointing people such as personnel direc- tors to their boards will be allowed to apply to the National Training Task Force for permission. When Tees were set up, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said only people of chairman or chief-executive status were eligible to sit on their boards. That was because he wanted Tec board members to have clout within their own companies and among their peers. Supporters of that view said that the influence of bodies similar to Tecs in the US had waned when the corporate sta- tus of their board members had fallen. Some Tecs, particularly in London, have found it difficult to attract chairmen and chief executives to their boards. Heads of large companies have been unwilling to take on such responsibilities. However, they EMPLOYMENT are unable to volunteer their personnel directors because of the government rules. That occurred with J. Sainsbury, the food retailer. Professional organisations, including the Institute of Per- sonnel Management (IPM), have urged the government to reconsider. Mr Brian Ward Lilley, direc- tor-general of the IPM, said: \"To argue that the personnel director of a large company has less clout that the chief executive of a very small com- pany does not make sense.\" He said he hoped that most Tecs would have at least one person- nel director on their boards. Personnel directors will not be allowed to chair Tec boards, however. Mr Howard said in a letter to Mr Eric Dancer, chair- man of G10, the group of Tec chairmen which acts as a link between the Tec movement and the government, that maintaining the top business leadership of Tecs was critical to their success. Tec chairmen will therefore have to be full-time chairmen or chief executives of private- sector companies with work- forces of more than 25 people and turnover of at least 5sm.",

   "text_content" : "WiHlain Dawkins opween distba across the Channel and at home T HE latest wave of rsot- ing in British cities has strong echoes in France, where the government has been wrestling with an increase in urban violence over the past year. It has responded by extend- ing central control over local- authority finance and housing in a partial reversal of the decentralisation of the past decade. All this makes an interesting parallel to the erosion of the powers of UK councils when Mrs Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, although the reason for centralisation in France is that the government is worried about local councils' inability to prevent such out. breaks. The government has also stepped up police numbers in the most sensitive areas, with an emphasis on UK-style pave- ment patrols, and has provided more training and leisure activities for the poorest subur- ban housing estates. It may be thanks to the urgency with which the gov- ernment has tackled the prob- lem that France has come through its long summer holi- day without the outbreaks that many were expecting after the riots in the spring. But nobody is betting that the problem has been cracked. Unemployment is at 9.4 per cent and rising - with higher rates in the worst-off suburbs. Racial tensions continue to simmer in a country with 3.6m resident foreigners and grow- ing concern over illegal immi- gration. The riot that sparked the government's concern took place just over a year ago at Vaulx-en-Velin, a housing estate near Lyons, when teen- agers burned down a shopping centre after a young motor- cycle passenger was killed in a crash with a police car. What was so worrying was that Vaulx-en-Velin, listed as one of the 400 dangerously poor sub- urbs with higher-than-average joblessness and immigration, had just undergone a much publicised facelift designed to soothe its social ills. In the ensuing re-think, the government appointed Mr Michel Delebarre as France's first minister of cities, charged Looking for trouble: a rioter on the streets of Paris, where the government has been seeking answers to the violence with improving the co- ordination of the FFr4bn (Â£4Om) the state spends annu ally on urban problems. He also tabled two laws, which received parliamentary approval in the spring, extend- ing central government inter- vention in urban policy. The first law shifts FFr900m of local tax income from rich areas to poor ones this year, rising to FFrl.5bn in 1993, to ensure that the poorest areas do not get poorer, a move which was criticised as reward- ing inefficient local authorities. The other scheme, nicknamed the anti-ghetto law, obliges all towns above a certain size to make available a fifth of their housing for poor families or pay central government to do so. That is in recognition of the need to integrate housing, in contrast to the islands of tower-block development that \"rance and the UK built in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet trouble broke out again last March, when youths clashed with police in Sartrou- vile, a district of one of the A TOTAL of 261 people have been arrested in connection with last week's riots on Tyneside, Northumbria police said yesterday. A 15-year-old boy will appear in court tomorrow charged with an arson attack on a Post Office in Scotswood, Newcastle upon Tyne, on Thursday night. However, the wave of vic lence appeared to have abated yesterday following a quiet Saturday evening. Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the Labour party, yesterday called on the gov- ernment to fulfil some of its promises on law and order. He said Labour was in favour of dealing harshly with those responsible for the riots. five new towns encircling Paris, after a young Arab was shot by a supermarket night guard. A month later, a wave of burning and looting swept Mantes-la-Jolie, another of Paris's satellite new towns. That violence was more wor- rying, because Mantes-la-Jolie produced the first suburban outbreak in recent memory to happen without a clear trigger. Ironically, the French govern- ment showed off the town as a triumph of urban planning to a visiting UK minister only last year. Its mayor, Mr Paul Picard, happens to be Mr Dele- barre's special adviser. The events at Mantes-la-Jolie prompted Mr Delebarre's team to come up with another urban package in what turned out to be a successful attempt to avoid another round of vio- lence as temperatures and tem- pers rose through the summer. The aim was to reinforce local police in vulnerable areas during the summer months and set up foot patrols in 40 high-risk suburbs by next year to improve community polic- ing. The state also increased sub- sidies to local authorities for youth training, pledged improve sporting facilities and launched a programme for 4,000 young people from the cities to take summer fanning jobs. The call by British police for the reinstatement of the Riot Act strikes another echo in France, where the police have a similar law at their disposal. French police can call a halt to a demonstration or disturbance, after which any- body who remains on the street can legally be arrested, as laid out in Britain's former Riot Act. However, the French police need the permission of the local preset, the state's repre- sentative in the dipartement, or local district, before doing so. In any case, causing a dis- turbance is an offence. A common complaint, in the French suburbs at least, is that the police have too much latitude and not enough staff. The Interior Ministry replies that it is satisfied with the powers available to its police force and that no legal changes are envisaged.",

   "text_content" : "By lan Hamilton Fazey, Northern Correspondent TOi'AL INTEREST charges paid by the 100 largest busi- nesses in Manchester rose last year by 41 per cent, according to an analysis of company results to be published today by the Manchester corporate finance department of KPMG Feat Marwick McLintock, the accountancy firm. The aggregate figures were \"841m last year and Â£596m in 1989. The change almost matches the drop in the compa- nies' total pre-tax profits, which fell by Â£231m to Â£1.82bn last year from Â£2.05bn in 1989. The results are based on fig- ures issued by companies at their year-ends. The businesses include 30 quoted companies based locally, 24 with owners else- where in the UK, 30 with over- seas owners and 16 unquoted businesses, including the Swin- ton insurance group and the Co-operative Wholesale Soci- ety. Their results of the analysis will be published for the first time today in the form of a company report called Man- chester plc, and annual reports will follow. The businesses have beer selected by turnover, which totalled more than Â£24.6bn. That rose 8.4 per cent last year from nearly Â£22.6bn in 1989. Operating profits fell from a total of Â£1.83bn in 1989 to Â£1.76bn last year as a result of a growing squeeze on margins. The analysts say, however, that inflationary pay rises were not to blame. Pay rises averaged only 5 per cent, so it was increases in other costs that depressed margins. Peat Marwick says that ris- ing interest charges caused extra pain because borrowings to fund investment had risen to record levels of nearly Â£1.20bn last year compared w\"ith Â£1.15bn in 1989. The combination of eroded profits and the rising cost of money cut interest cover - the ratio which indicates how many times profits will cover interest charges - from 4.4 times in 1989 to 3.2 times last year. A decline in the ratio of cur. rent assets to current liabilities from 1.3 to 1.2 showed a decline in liquidity. However, that fig ure would have been worse if more debt had been short-term. imnpoved stock turnover - 8.4 times last year from 8.2 times in 1989 - suggests reduc- tions in stock levels. But aver- age customer-indebtedness increased slightly from 102 days to 104 days. Peat Marwick says the health of businesses in Manchester will suffer if this later payment of debts becomes a long-term trend. Although current liabilities rose by 18 per cent, trade credi- tors increased by only 9 per cent, indicating a tightening of credit terms all round. That was translated into increased dependence on short-term loans, which rose by 42 per cent to exceed Â£3.6bn. Indeed, Manchester depen- dence on debt resulted in a reduction in equity gearing from 45 per cent in 1989 to 43 per cent last year, with long-term loans increasing by a third in two years. Efforts by the companies to reverse this trend have been evident this year in the widespread use of rights issues to swap debt for equity, as well as in un- bundling and sale of non-core business segments.

The continental cities are likely to benefit from their proximity to eastern Europe, according to the survey. Also seen to be in their favour is that their regulatory regimes are likely to become closer to London's.

   "text_content" : "By Ian Hamilton Fazey SOME regional managers of venture capital funds - whose activities are often an early pointer to economic trends - are beginning to look again for high-risk investments in busi- nesses such as housebuilding, which fluctuate with the eco- nomic cycle. Such \"cyclical\" businesses can be bought for seven times earnings or less. Mr Charles Richardson, director for north- ern England and Scotland with 31, the venture capital group, said similar businesses cost 15 times earnings or more before the recession. \"Timing is everything in investment activity,\" Mr Rich- ardson said. \"Now is the time to be bold.\" Fund managers say they believe the recession is over and that it is time to buy cheaply into small, well-man- aged engineering and construc- tion enterprises, as well as into fitted-kitchen and other home- improvement businesses which will grow quickly as the econ- omy recovers. Funds now searching for investments tend to operate in regions which have been least affected by the recession, such as northern England. Most investments are expected to involve either management buy-outs of subsidiary compa- nies from groups without the funds to expand them, or sup- port for experienced managers hoping to buy their way into struggling companies. Mr Geoff Burns, a director of the Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone financial services group, described the main obstacle now faced by fund managers as \"basic human fear\". He explained: \"Three years ago, anyone launching a man- agement buy-out where the parent refused the offer didn't worry about the sack - because they could walk straight into another job. Now jobs are scarcer, people are worried about the risk.\" Mr Richardson said that 3i's northern offices were also looking for strongly managed start-ups. 3i's experimental northern scheme to support small grow- ing businesses with venture capital asums under Â£100,000 as an alternative to bank loans has had a quiet summer. Inqui- ries have now picked up strongly, however.",

   "text_content" : "By Philip Coggan THE SPATE of thefts of high-performance cars, high- lighted by recent \"loyriding\" incidents, has led insurers to raise premiums for owners of such cars by up to 80 per cent. Norwich Union, the UK's largest motor insurer, plans to increase premiums for all motorists by a minimum of 20 per cent from October 1. Mr Peter Woolterton, the company's assistant general manager, said: \"Our statistics show that certain sports saloons, 'hot hatches' and other high-performance cars have particularly bad claims records and are prime targets for car thieves. From now on their owners will have to pay their fair share.\" The increases will be great- est in areas with bad claims statistics. For example, a 30-year-old motorist in Luton with a Peugeot 205 GTi will pay Â£955 for comprehensive cover, with a maximum no- claims discount, an increase of 74 per cent on the current pre- mium of Â£549. The same motorist driving a Ford Escort LX 1.4 in Gloucester will pay just Â£366. Most policyholders will also have to pay the first Â£100 of any theft claim unless the car was in a locked garage at the time of the theft. Other insurers have imposed similar excesses. Royal Insur- ance will not insure against theft of those cars left on the streets at night in certain \"high-risk\" areas. Last year, Norwich Union paid out Â£332m in private car claims. Theft cost the group Â£48m in 1990, up 66 per cent on the previous year. A number of insurance groups are increasing premi- ums. Eagle Star is raising them by 9.1 per cent on Octo- ber 1, after an 8.5 per cent increase in July. General Accident has pushed up premiums by around 25 per cent over the past year. Royal Insurance has just increased premiums by 10 per cent, following a 9 per cent rise in April.",

It Is, therefore, a vital medium for any businessman lai Japan: Dealing successfully with the media is' generally recognised as a subtle skill,i: and most large companies employ professional public relations peopld to advise them. But senior managers still like to retain a large say on how their company presents itself This process does not work for for- eign businesses in Japan, mainly because the media, published in Japa- nese, are inaccessible to the typical expatriate manager. Not only can he not himself judge how best to approach them, he is also poorly placed to assess the advice he receives from public relations professionals. The problem is intensified by some practices of the Japanese media which may seem strange and threat- ening to foreign business. Indeed, in the not too distant past, most Japa- nese media, like most Japanese organ- isations, were systematically hostile to foreign interests, and xenophobia lingers in some quarters. In the mid-1980s, when foreign financial institutions were fighting for nothing more than the opportunity to do business in Japan on a similar basis with their Japanese competitors, it sometimes seemed as if the media - and, in particular, Nikkei - were little more than the cheering section for the protectionist home side. More than one foreign businessman has -had the dismaying experience of seeing sensitive internal data given to the Japanese Ministry of Finance in confidence appear later in the Nikkei in a less than flattering context. The Japanese media, Nikkei included, also intimidate in much the same way as Japanese industrial com- panies do - by the sheer number and aggressiveness of their troops. Before going to Japan, US and European businessmen probably do not experi- ence being approached three or four times a week by journalists from dif- ferent departments of the same news- paper, all of them on rather unfocused but relentless and comprehensive fishing expeditions. And they proba- bly have never been disturbed at home in the evening by a knock at the door by a journalist wanting to discuss their companies' problems. At Nikkei and other Japanese media, these are the normal, everyday meth- ods of digging out news. Is all this part of the great Japan Inc conspiracy to dominate the world? After spending four weeks inside Nik- kei this spring, I am confident that it \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t i not. Do foreign businessmen have a hope of getting a full and fair hearing from Nikkei? Yes, increasingly so, subject to the unfortunate tendency of journalists there, as in most coun- tries, to favour the home side in a pinch. Nihon Keizai Shimbun Inc has been a totally independent, private, joint stock company for over 100 years. Only employees are allowed to own shares. When an employee retires, he has to sell his shares back to the company treasury at par value, and the directors then offer them to other employees at par value. In addition to the flagship Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Economic Daily), the company publishes three other specialised business newspapers in Japanese, the Nikkei Weekly (for- merly called the Japan Economic Journal) in English, plus various mag- azines, directories and books. It oper- ates a real-time electronic financial markets information service in Japa- nese and English as well as a huge economic and financial database in both languages. It also owns a net- work of television stations in Japan. The flagship paper has a circulation of over 3m copies per day, compared with the FT's 300,000. Nikkei reported pre-tax profits of Y21.3bn (Â£93.01m) on revenues of Y241.3bn in 1990. The group's policy after the second world war, mirroring that of Japanese industry in general, has been to promote fast growth rather than high profits. This policy has, of course, been facilitated by the absence of external shareholders demanding better profit performance, but it has also been extremely suc- cessful. Group revenues doubled between 1977 and 1986 and doubled again between 1986 and 1990. The most striking feature of Nikkei's editorial department is its size (some 1,300 journalists), com- pared with the FT's 350. The hyper- competitive environment of Japan's media industry forces all major play- ers - and Nikkei is certainly one of them - to spare no effort in digging out exclusive stories. he typical Nikkei journalist also faces an endless succes- sion of deadlines through the day - for the group's electronic news services and, in some cases, its speci- alised papers as well as the morning and evening editions of the main paper. That, incidentally, is one reason why he often seems to behave like a vacuum cleaner, sucking up every bit of information he can glean. Even if he may not get an exclusive story for the main paper from an interview, he can usually get something to submit to at least one of the group's outlets. The lessons for the foreign busi- nessman - and some have learned them well in recent years - are many. For one, you have to devote to Nikkei journalists the same levels of time and energy that they are ready to give to you. You probably have to take them into your confidence more than you would other journalists, but they will be responsive. You may suspect that what you tell a Nikkei journalist is going to be transmitted to your com- petitors and relevant government offi- cials, and you are probably right But don't be shy or offended. Feel free to retaliate and pick his brains for his assessments, which will proba- bly be acute, of what your competi- tors are up to and how the winds are blowing in MITI or MoS. Japanese still look on this sort of exchange of confidential information between peo- ple who are obligated to each other as normal, although values are changing and it may soon come to be consid- ered as unethical as it is in the West It is thus frustrating that, just as you have got to know and trust a Nikkei journalist, he is transferred to a different section. They jobs rotate, on average, every two years. You have no choice but to get to know the successor. The advantage is that you can quite quickly accumulate a large number of Nikkei contacts spread throughout the editorial department. Nikkei journalists are, in general, very young. They start straight out of university in their early 20s, and most are forced to give up reporting and take up desk-bound editing jobs in their early 30s. They are inclined, like most young people, to be brash, eager to make a mark and not too interested in the less sensational subtleties of an issue you may be trying patiently to explain to them. But, unless your grievance is a solid one, don't bother appealing to a higher authority. Senior executives of some of the biggest companies in Japan admit that even they cannot pick up the phone and ask Nikkei's president or editor to stifle a reporter's story. Similarly, Japanese companies also fed unable to resist pressure to allow Nikkei the opportunity to write about their developments before announc- ing them to other media. This is plainly unfair to competing media. But compnies know that Nikkel is vneied to g generous coverage to exclusive stories, and very short *brft to press releases. It has virtually become accepted jpractce that big company announca ments 9ppear in Nikkei in the form of a \"leak a day or two before the for- mal announcement is made. Foreign coaes gnore this custom at their Whatever efforts the foreign busi- esman makes, there Is no guarantee it his company will be treated with fairness consistently. Nikkei has long been oacially committed to liberalisa- tion of industrial and financial mar- kets in Japan, but it is also part of the society in which it operates. It may be financially and manageri- ally independent but, for a long time, it preferred the comfort of sticking close to the self-serving establishment consensus to the stress of standing up for unpopular principles. Only in the past few years has it become strident, not only in its edito- rial comments but also in its news coverage, in criticising protectionists of any stripe that remain in the country. Nikkei Journalists are now expected to give a fair hearing to for- eign viewpoints and, by and large, they do. But journalism is a strange busi- ness. Senior writers and editors may well have a clear policy, but the junior reporters who are actually cov- ering the stories may see things in a different way, and, because of time pressures, can often slip their biases and prejudices past their bosses. At the moment, there is an anti- American streak among many young Japanese business and political reporters. They are cocky about Japan's economic success and look on Americans as lazy whingers. Nikkei editors are appalled by this simplistic view, but they admit to problems keeping it out of their papers. Nikkei is, in many ways, a para- digm of Japan. For most of the period after the second world war, its only internal policy was to grow, its only editorial policy was to support any- thing that contributed to the coun- try's economic growth. The consensus within Japanese society on this stance was nearly total, making news judgment simple. Today, the consen- sus is breaking down, as external interests and issues force themselves onto Japan's agenda. Meanwhile, Nikkei has, especially in its electronic media, extended its reach around the globe, making it much more important that its report- ing and analysis is consistently fair and accurate. The group's editors are well aware of these new challenges and are rising to them with predict- able vigour. The result is that their newspapers are getting better and bet- ter. They are also getting easier for the foreign businessman to deal with.",

   "text_content" : "I Diane Summers on equality of recruitment T he smple declaration in Job advertisements and recruitment literature that an organisation is an \"equal opportunities employer\" is still seen by many as suff- cient, somehow, to make the equality actually happen. The point has been taken up this week by the Commission for Racial Equality with the publication of its latest best practice guide to monitoring and achieving racial equality in employment.* Many of the principles explored in the guide can be applied equally to the issue of sexual equality. The CRE's main argument is that, once an organisation has accepted that it must have an effective equal opportunities programme, monitoring is the only way of finding out whether the policies are suc- ceeding in practice. Says Mary Coussey, director of the commission's employ- ment division: \"Monitoring is essential to an equal opportu- nity policy and for the effective use of scarce human resources. And just as the use of targets is a feature of business plans, so equality targets are a state- ment of what progress to expect and to work for.\" The words \"monitoring\" and \"targets\", particularly when associated with issues of race and sex, persist in having neg- ative connotations for many employers. The CRE, recognising this, has also published a compan- ion booklet which aims to counter some of the most fre- quently made objections to the idea of keeping a records of ethnic origin. The commission points to a Policy Studies Institute finding that as many as a third of pri- vate-sector employers discrimi- nate directly against Asian and Afro-Caribbean job applicants. Says the CRE: \"No major employer can reasonably be satisfied that direct or indirect discrimination is not occur- ring.\" Even where a senior man- ager, personally, is not discrim- inating, some of his or her employees may be operating their own informal racial barri- ers against ethnic minorities. On a practical level, the CRE provides in its best practice booklet a step-by-step guide to the collection and analysis of ethnic origin data. It takes in * pluning and consultation with the workforce on the col- lection of data. This needs to be carried out at the earliest possible stage to clear up mis- understandings and ensure co-operation. SEthnic classification. Col- lecting information in too broad categories may disguise the greater disadvantage sus- fered by some subgroups. The CRE suggests a minimum of five ethnic categories for moni- toring purposes: white, Afro- Caribbean, Indian, Paki- stani/Bangladeshi, and other. * Data collection on existing workforce. A particular day, week or month should be cho- sen for data collection. The CRE has found the method that works best is a combina- tion of self-classification - where employees themselves state on a form their ethnic origin - and management \"top-up\", with supervisors chasing up replies. * Application forms. All applicants, including those who send CVs or letters, should fill out an application form, so that data can be col- lected on a consistent basis. Record reasons for rejection at each stage of the selection pro- cess and keep all papers on file for about 12 months. Finally, the CRE emphasises that collecting ethnic origin data is not an end in itself - the information needs to be analysed and reviewed. As a rough rule of thumb, negative replies to two questions, in par- ticular, should prompt reme- dial action. First: \"Is the proportion of ethnic minority applicants what you would expect when compared with relevant bench- marks and equality targets, or are there major differences between white and ethnic minority groups?\" Second: \"Are success rates for ethnic minority candidates at least four-fifths of the rate for white candidates?\" *A Measure of Equality: mon- itoring and achieving racial equality in employment.

   "text_content" : "GENERAL election fever subsided somewhat in the UK last week as unemployment figures for August registered another big rise and the infla tion figures came in a bit worse than the markets had expected. A rash of rights issues, prof- its warnings and bankruptcies overshadowed government claims that the economy was back on course and the pre- dicted second-half recovery well on the way. But more news about the real economy today should help clear the pic ture. August's retail sales volumes will be taken apart for signs that a recovery has begun on Britain's high streets, in spite of ceaseless efforts by retailers to discount goods and stimu- late trade. Ms Ruth Lea, Mitsubishi Bank's economist, supports the government's claims that retail sales are now on an upwari trend, boosting hopes of a con- sumer-led recovery. July's vol- umes were revised up to a sharp 0.7 per cent increase, after June's buoyant 1.5 per cent rise. She projects a 0.3 per cent increase for August, slightly above the consensus of market forecasts compiled by UK Metail sales Volume (average 1685-100) 123 122 121 120 119 118 Souro: Dtstrnmm MMS International, the finance research company. Industrial production output is also on the up, suggesting an underlying improvement on the supply side. Though manu- facturing output in July is pre- dicted to be flat, after declining for a year, the overall produc- tion index is predicted to rise following a jump in oil output in the North Sea. In the US, the Federal Reserve's easing of monetary conditions on Friday after the sharpest fall in retail sales for seven months should help the recovery along. There was no inflationary danger as inflation has been on a downwards path since peaking last autumn. A modest recovery in the manufacturing sector is expec ted in the output data for August, .while the for ward-looking NAPM index \"has already picked up sharply and suggests a steady improve ment in output growth,\" according to Mr Neil Mackin- non, economist at Yamaichi International, the Japanese securities house. But he pointed out that growth in the US economy remained \"unbalanced\" with consumer spending in the dol- drums. In Japan, real gross national product data for the second quarter is expected to show weakness in personal con- sumption, to be offset by buoy- ancy in exports. Other important events and statistics, with median market forecasts from MMS in brack- ets include: Today: Switzerland, Bank Holiday in Zurich. UK, August retail sales (down 0.2 per cent), July industrial production (0.5 per cent), manufacturing out- put (flat), July unit labour costs (9.3 per cent, three-month average). France, August pre iminary consumoer prices Index ( (0.8 per cent). Swe- den, Auusttrade balance. DenmaiAugust CPL _nada July inventories to shapments ratio, July unfilled orders.

   "text_content" : "GERALD RATNER will certainly regret his recent throwaway comment on the quality of one product sold by his jewellery group when inter- ims are announced next week. His less-than-flattering joke about a sherry decanter turned some people away from Rat- ners, although some probably went next door to his separate \"upmarket\" stores. The group as a whole is expected to announce on Mon- day a plunge to a Â£15m loss, compared to a Â£9.3m profit last time. Heavy losses in the UK are likely to be the main rea- son behind the plunge. Kingfisher is expected to show on Tuesday a decline from Â£65.4m to about Â£60m, mainly because of a sharp drop in profits from property devel- opment. However, deepening losses at Woolworths and Comet will also contribute to the fall. Tesco, the same day, will perhaps thave he best news in the food and retailing sector with profits forecast to rise 33 per cent to Â£230m for the first half. However, the rights issue in January means earnings per share are expected to increase just 15 per cent to 8.1p. On Tuesday Fisons, the pharmaceutical and horticul- tural products group, is expec- ted to report interim pre-tax profits of Â£105m, up 16 per cent from last year, giving earnings per share of 11.7p, up 12 per cent on the previous interims. Guinness, the international drinks group, is likely to report on Thursday interim taxable profits of Â£350m compared to last year's Â£322m. The expected 8 per cent increase, while not as sparkling as the 33 per cent rise during the comparable period, was achieved against difficult trading conditions, which included the Gulf War. It is no secret that trading has been rough for Hawker Siddeley, making for slim chances that there will be any lift in interim profits to be announced on Thursday. The City is looking for pre-tax prof- its of around Â£60m, although some analysts are taking their forecasts down further. This is substantially down from the Â£94m realised at the last interim, stripping out heavy contracting losses suffered then. The UK recession is expected to have taken a further toll on APV, the maker of food manu- facturing equipment which saw a sharp deterioration in the second half of last year. A 40 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profit to Â£15m includ- ing further restructuring costs is on the cards. Evidence of more pain in the construction sector can be expected next week when it is the turn of Rugby on Monday and RMC on Thursday to announce interim results. The first half, as has been shown by recent figures from broadly based contractors, housebuilders and developers, was dreadful - particularly the first three months of the year when bad winter weather further restricted output. Forecasts for Rugby, one of only three British cement man- ufacturers, suggest the com- pany will be fortunate to break Â£20m for the first half com- pared with Â£34.5m last time. Profits for RMC, the world's largest ready-mixed concrete company, are forecast to be between Â£65m and Â£75m com- pared with Â£109.3m in the first half of 1990. Recession aside, Morgan Crucible, the industrial materi- als group reporting on Monday, could show interim pre-tax profits up slightly to Â£29m.",

   "text_content" : "T his has been a green summer in New York. Not green in the European envi- ronmental political sense, but in the more traditional way of viewing gardens. Included among the masters of 20th-cen- tury Modernism, like Picasso, Balanchine and Le Corbusier, is the 82-year-old Brazilian landscape architect, Roberta Burle Marx. By employing ingredients from all the other arts - light, colour, motion, sound and structure - in the service of garden design, he made the kind of creative leap, without reference to the past, that makes an art form totally new. He is clearly the Le N6tre of our times. This summer, as its first exhibition ever on a landscape architect, the Museum of Mod- ern Art sponsored Roberto Burle Marx: The Unnatural Art of the Garden, a small display of his early drawings along with plans, models and photo- graphs of ten major landscapes out of the almost 3000 he has designed, some only on the drawing board. The most impressive exhibit of all was the slide lecture delivered by Burle Marx in person that gave a rare aperfu into the way sim- ple yet fortuitous events ignite genius. For Burle Marx, who was born in SAo Paulo and now lives near Rio de Janeiro, it was a visit at age 19 to the Dahlem Botanic Garden in Ber- lin where he first saw a collec- tion of rare Brazilian plants. A plant collector from age seven, he now houses at his home in Campo Grande almost 3500 dif- ferent native plants. Dedicated to saving the flora of the Amazon Basin and the first to use these species in designed gardens, Burle Marx in no way tries to recreate or even to mimic their natural habitat. Instead, the brilliant tones and lush foliage became for him what the curator of the show, William Howard Adams, rnlle tho \"rnaw manriala\" Atf hii rt justqai a reinforced Firsb ierves how a 0ant grs in ue before it .become s an actor,\" as he describes i, i# his gardens. A painter, muralist, sculptor, architect and set designer, as well as an exemplary botanist, he draws on all these talents. :Ie begins with multicoloured garden plans, many with kid- ney-shaped planting beds that resemble the later cut-outs of Matisse or the paintings of Jean Arp. Long known for such public landscapes as the wavy mosaic of the red, white and black tiled promenade that mirrors the crashing surf along the Copacabana Beach, he emerged in the exhibition as the con- summate creator of garden set- tings. There is something finally ecological in the spread- ing of his agaves, water lilies, bromeliads and palms, particu- larly at one garden overlaying the ruins of a coffee plantation at Fazenda Vargem Grande. Now the old coffee bean bath is incorporated in a series of pools and cascades, his \"liquid sculptures.\" The catalogue ($19.95), writ- ten by Adams, expands an the various themes and carries an important message about gar dens in the New World. (Sched uled to tour internationally, the show will open next at the Mendosa Foundation, Caracas, Venezuela, in January 1992.) Two of Roberto Burle Marx's garden plans in gouache on cardboard also figure in an exhibition at the Max Protetch Gallery simply called Green, which includes drawings and models by a dozen architects, landscape architects and art- ists who design gardens or gar- den structures (until Septem- ber 28). What makes this show of 26 pieces challenging is its diver- sity as a travelogue of ideas and places. One need only see the realty of summer roof gar- iens on thie Mannhat skyif to appreciate Rogeir Ferrl's fan taPy prodipol of a tree-liki tower sproutn leafy fronds -V James Wines's design for * Japanese cultural centre si Paris where, a series of glam enclosed terraces and outdool gardens blur the distinctioi between inside and outside.

With one of the largest her- bariums in the world, many specimens hand sewn to their mounts, it is also a formidable research institution with scien- tists working in the Amazon Basin recording disappearing plant specimens and studying methods by which local herbs and roots used medicinaply can be applied to current medical research. Their extensive coih- munity garden programme that has transformed vacant, lots into flower and vegetable gardens has made New York a greener place to live. Paula Deitz Colin Amery is away.",

   "text_content" : "PHILADELPHIA Now 43 and with a chronic knee injury, Mikhail Baryshni- kov has given up the big classi- cal roles, but he is clearly not ready to stop dancing. During his years at American Ballet Theatre, he used to go out on tour during layoffs with a small group of dancers from that company and elsewhere, with a mixed repertory. Since he quit his post as artistic director of ABT, he has formed a small ad hoc touring group called the White Oak Dance Project - after the estate on the border of Georgia and Flo- rida belonging to Howard Gil- man, a long-time Baryshnikov supporter, where the company rehearses. It has just com- pleted its third tour, with a penultimate performance at the Mann Music Center in Phil- adelphia (so far, it has not played New York City.) The personnel of the com- pany, a dozen or so dancers from ballet and modem dance companies, especially that of Mark Morris, has changed from one tour to another. All the choreography has been by Mor- ris, including two works made especially for White Oak, Motorcade (to the Saint Sadns Septet for piano, trumpet, and strings) and, replacing it in the most recent tour, A Lake (to Haydn's Horn Concerto No 2 in D major). Going Away Party, an instant classic when it was first given by the Monnaie Dance Group/Mark Morris in Brussels in April 1990, was in the repertory for the first White Oak tour. This time, the performance benefited from the presence of more members of Morris's own company than before, especially Morris him- self in his role of odd man out. Baryshnikov was miscast in that role: he didn't quite look as if he belonged in Texas. Morris brings to it an exqui- sitely judged elegiac touch, without disturbing the balance of the affectionate and the rib- ald. Baryshnikov danced in all the other pieces on the pro- gramme. He has made Morris's early solo, Ten Suggestions, completely his own, starting with a crisp double tour en l'air and deftly sketching the moods and fancies suggested by such props as a hoop, a chair, a length of ribbon, a topee - and by the Alexander Tcherepnin \"Bagatelles\" to which the piece is set. In Deck of Cards, another of Morris's pieces to country-and-Western music, Baryshnikov brings a fanatic gleam to a song about a GI who offers a Biblical inter- pretation of his pack of cards. In the other solo that makes up this work, Morris appears in travesty, a performance as powerful as his impersonation of the tragic queen in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. The opener, Canonic 3/4 Studies (1982), is a series of movement jokes to a collection of favourite piano waltzes. The little pas de trois that rings the changes on the way the cava- lier alternately lifts the two danseuses reminds me of Ash- ton's Tweedledum and Tweedle- dee. Baryshnikov proves to be a master of deadpan comedy here, which cannot be said for all the company, some of whom telegraph the jokes. A Lake, the new piece, does not have the striking original- ity of Morris's masterpiece L'Allegro, II Penseroso ed II Moderato - it's in a rather Paul Taylorish vein, in fact. But Morris's musicality shows itself in such felicities as a moment in the first cadenza, danced by Baryshnikov, when the horn sounds like a faint echo and two women are lifted in suspended jetis, echoing one of his movements. The adagio, in which one dancer after another falls in a swoon, to be caught by others, is beautiful and moving. The fleet and witty Kate Johnson, formerly with the Taylor company, who has been on all three White Oak tours, again proves herself an ideal partner for Baryshni- kov. David Vaughan"

   "text_content" : "ALTE OPWR, FRANKFURT Thp loth mPnturv nrnduced at least five oneras neat romoones oasa. Oiut I tided ito throe' acts and an UffIllica -Ais nopetheless a\" d opera, doxiiitated by tableuof Meyerbeeran design and proportion, skilfulW interwoven wi*th pas- sages -of warm, reti ed lyricism. In te Genoa competition, Verdi's aroval is said to have swung the jury in Franchetti'o favour. Toscanini conducted some of the opening run and also the 1895 revival. The opera was subsequently heard in German in Hamburg and Prague, and Titta Russo sang the title part in Monte Carlo, Buenos Aires, Philadelphia and Chicago. Listening to this disciplined, poetic perfor- mance by the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra and Budapest Radio Choir under Mar- cello Viotti, it was easy to understand the work's early popularity. It shares some of the Mediterranean sea air and tragic grandeur of Simon Boccanegra. It is an open invitation to spectacle (Verona and Earl's Court please note). There is also a well-characterised exotic element in the Act three Mexican setting, with a fiery soprano aria for the Indian princess Anacoana. Franchetti moves commandingly between gentle arioso and dramatic crescendo. Indeed, the instrumental and choral writing repeatedly seizes the imagination, with rich polyphonic harmonies and grateful woodwind obbligatos. Why, then, has Cristoforo Colombo suffered such long neglect? Its festival character no doubt has something to do with it: Franchetti imakes no attempt to \"sell\" the opera with a btqmantic sub-plot, but it makes heavy demands on casting, and only Coltumnbus and the bass role of Don Roldano (the Spanish knight who acts as the hero's evil counterpart) have a decent even- ing's work. Most of the action consists of well- populated set-pieces, and unlike Boccanegra or the Foscari doge, we never really pierce the historical figure of Columbus, despite a long and moving death scene at the tomb of Queen Isa- bella of Spain. The Frankfurt perorimance found Renato Bruson in genero*ui. Tltce, though unable to slice through the e binbles as Russo might have done. But the casting was right: there is no melodrama in the part, and Bruson did not try to inject any. He did, however, capture Colum- bus' disillusionnmet when the New World turns out to be a fals utopia. As Roldano, Roberto Scandiuzzi made a suave villain. Marco Berti, an elegant young tenor, sang the part of Guevara, Columbus' loyal captain. The soprano writing is all light and linear: Gisella Pasino's Anacoana had a welcome dash of temperament, while Rosella Ragatzu caught the visionary quality of Isabella's Act one prayer. But the outstanding contributions came from chorus and orchestra. The Hungarians sang with the kind of voluminous ease and transpar- ent delicacy for which East European choirs are justifiably renowned. The orchestra, clearly engaged by Franchetti's generous scoring, was no less impressive, and Viotti presided with an attractive blend of dynamism and support. Andrew Clark",

   "text_content" : "mvAIL AseRT HALL iery P~rp season borrows an opera or two from one of the u companies - some- tfies walked through, some- 4t1in iemi-Â«tavf; but it is unusual for a Prom opera to serve as preview for a forth- 'coming production. On Friday Sir Charles Mackerras con- *ducted his Welsh National Opera forces (not even walking iuch, just standing and sit- ting) in Mozart's Idomeneo, ,which opens at the Cardiff 'New Theatre this Wednesday. Rewarding but protracted, it ran almost half an hour over time, even without the ballet music. For one thing, Idomeneo got his final aria, \"Torna la pace\". Presumably a late decision, since the programme-text omit- ted it, but a. welcome one: the opera always seems incomplete without it, even if Mozart him- self cut it from the 1781 premi- Ore. Dennis O'Neill's proudly jtallanate tenor was fully equal .to it, and earlier he had made an heroic assault on the fear- some \"Fuor del mar\", incurring only a couple of scratches. It was an unaccustomed pleasure to hear this role delivered :so robustly (and with ipxemplay diction). It was a less goqd idea t4' give Arbace his long, thankless aria too, which Anthony Roden add , gnfully but with- out much allure. Young Paul Charles Clarke made a promis- ing impression as the High Priest, and Ashley Thorburn as a pre-recorded Neptune. Suz- anne Murphy sang a commit- ted, interesting Electra. As Ilia, the very yopng.Rebeda 1Evans replaced Amanda Ro6croft (out of action with glandular fever) and triumphed. Her large soprano, beautifully, used, her sterling breath-control and not least her spirited character were assets to the whole opera. Too often, lUas are content to flute gently and sweetly, especially when their Ida- mantes are sopranos too; with a tenor Idamante, as here, an Ilia needn't overdo her frail femininity. In fact John Mark Ainsley's Idamante was a gen- tle soul, though sung with refined confidence notably \"Non ho colpa\", where he orna- mented the reprise to splendid effect. Their duet was melting and rather slow, like much of the later music. With the ten- derest intentions, Mackerras seemed to make the greater part of Act 3 one long rollen- tando: over-stately, I thought, and - at least for a concert performance - riskily undra- matic. Still, the conductor's scrupu- lous, searching,. way with all the recitatives was a particular glory of the performance. They are a glory of the opera, of course (and one of the reasons why it is awkwardly long); never . before had Mozart invested recitativo and arioso passages with such expressive richness. Mackerras made his orchestra live up to those unusual demands, and even long-standing Idomeneno lov- ers will have had their breath taken away at some of the poi- gnant turns he revealed. The chorus was excellent, as always: \"Oh voto tremendo\" was tremendous. David Murray",

   "text_content" : "WATRMILL TliATRWK, NWBURY, BRKSHIRK The tale of how this- 1716 comedy has been brought back to the stage is itself romantic. Rummaging In a secondhand bookshop, the actress Joanna Dunham came across a bat- tered 1753-copy of volume H of the miscellaneouis works of Jbseph Addison (he of The Spectator). It included two plays, Cato and The Drummer. Cato, a serious neoclassical drama that was a great hitin its day (exciting Whigs and Tories alike in its parallelto the recent political crisis involving the Duke of Marl- borough), has often been republished. It is, however,a dodo. It was The Drummer, a farcical comedy, that caught Dunham's interest. When first presented at Drury Lane in 1716, The Drum- mer was given a prestigious cast - including Mrs Oldfield (the original Mrs Sullen of The Beaux' Stratagem) and Colley Cibber (the great player of fop .roles, reviser of Shakespeare, Poet Laureate and prime target of The Dunciad). But only Addison's Spectator colleague, Richard Steele - then manag- ing Drury Lane - knew who had written it. Addison was shortly to marry the widowed Countess of Warwick 'and to become Secretary of State. Probably- as Dunham argues, he kept his authorship of The Drummer secret in case it should fail and endanger his ambitions. As it happened, not only The Drummer but also Addison's health failed. He abandoned his post as Secretary of State, his marriage seems to have been unhappy and in 1719, aged only 47, he died. The Drummer, however, soon came into its own. Successfully revived (with his name) in 1722, it was often given until at least 1762 and was translated into French, Italian and Ger- man. In our time, however, it has been neglected. The play is like a comic ver- sion of the end of The Odyssey. Sir George Truman, who is believed to have been killed in the wars, returns in disguise to his country home. Among the suitors who pester his faithful wife (\"the mirror of widow- hood\"), Tinsel is a marvel- lously self-regarding fop (\"Do you laugh to show your wit or our teeth?\") while Fantome, less socially ept, is trying to scare Tinsel away by pretend- ing to be the ghost that haunts the house. (The Haunted House is the play's subtitle.) The play is always lively, tells its story well and has many fine scenes. It does not abound in quotable lines - that is not its style - but at least six of its ten roles are good ones, written to com- pliment expert character act- ors. The great merit of Wendy Toye's staging is its vigour and the faith it places in Addison's unexaggerated words. The audience is happily held from first to last and laughs easily throughout. There is too much scenery, and some unnecessary scene-changes occur. (Addison, a classicist, observed the uni- ties.) The Swingle Singers muzak, used before and between scenes, is a pain, and the little bop done to this on one occasion by Vellum (John Conroy) is worse. But the play is never trashed, and most of its actors do it proud. I single out one: Judy Buxton, for the musical clarity of her diction and decorous vivacity of her characterisation.

   "text_content" : "PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr James Baker, the US secre- tary of state, are patient and Sdogged men. They have both invested considerable time and effort during the past few months in seeking to organise a Middle East peace conference aimed at securing peace and security for Israel and some form of self-determination for the Palestinan people. It is a worthy aim, based on UN resolutions, supported by virtually the entire interna- tional community. No one has underestimated the immensity of the task, but in the wake of communism's collapse in east- ern Europe and the revolution in the Soviet Union the chances of progress must be better than at any time in the past four decades. The changed and generally more constructive attitude of possible Arab participants to a peace conference illustrates how important and radical those changes in the interna- tional environment have been. The release of hostages in Leb- anon is further tangible evi- dence. Mr Bush might expect his best friend and closest ally in the region, Israel, to be the most supportive of his endea- vours. But Mr Bush's hastily summoned press conference last week, when he threatened to veto congressional approval of an Israeli request for $10bn in loan guarantees, showed instead just how thinly his patience is being stretched by the attitudes of the govern- ment in Jerusalem. Requests ignored For 15 years successive US Administrations have been asking Israel not to build vil- lages or towns and settle its citizens on the Arab land occu- pied during the 1967 war. Israel has chosen to ignore those requests while continuing to receive more than $3bn in annual aid from Washington. President Bush, enthused by the willingness of Syria and other Arab nations to attend a peace conference in October, has again urged Israel to stop building in the occupied terri- tories. Israel increased the pace of building. Mr Bush then asked Israel to delay making its formal request for US guar- antees for the $10bn it esti- mates that it needs to borrow in the next five years to settle up to Im Jews arriving from the Soviet Union. Israel ignored him and made the request. Lobbying campaign Mr Bush then asked Con- gress to delay consideration of the request for four months, citing the possible damage it might do to prospects for con- vening a Middle East peace conference. American Jewish organisations responded with a vigorous lobbying campaign in Congress amounting to a direct challenge to the President's authority and drawing from him the veto threat. If this is how Israel sees fit to behave towards its friends who are sin- cerely seeking to be helpful, then it should not be entirely surprised if there is increased sympathy for its enemies. Mr Bush has already had to suffer repeated assertions by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, and other members of his cabinet, that there is no chance of Israel trading land for peace, as called for in UN resolutions. It is an assertion which strikes at the core of the peace process and inevitably adds to the diffi- culties of persuading Arab leaders to come to the confer- ence table. To provide at this sensitive moment loan guaran- tees for settling Soviet Jews would inevitably be seen by Arabs as further evidence of Israel's intent to continue set- tling Arab land and of US con- nivance in the process. Mr Bush appears determined not to be cast in this role. The US and Europe have their own vital interests in the Middle East which, it seems, may be diverging ever more emphati- cally from the intentions of the present Israeli government. The US will not allow this divergence to pose a threat to Israel's basic security, but Mr Shamir should be made to understand that there are lim- its beyond which the US gov- ernment will not be pushed. There will be little interna- tional sympathy for Israel if it intensifies its confrontation with Mr Bush. It should, on the contrary, take the opportunity today of the seventh visit by Mr Baker to Israel since the end of the Gulf war, to help remove the remaining obsta- cles to a peace conference.",

   "text_content" : "THE latest proposals for constitutional reform in the United Kingdom put the Labour party on the spot, at a time when it is slipping in the polls. Last week the Liberal Democrats produced a broadly attractive set of ideas for the codification and restructuring of Britain's unwritten constitu- tion. The list includes the devo- lution of powers from West- minster to the regions and localities, a bill of rights, elec- toral reform, and freedom of information. This morning Labour is chal- lenged by more revolutionary proposals from the Institute for Public Policy Research, which describes itself as the \"influen- tial left of centre think tank\". They are put forward in \"The Constitution of the United Kingdom,\" a short paperback. The IPPR is not the Labour party, but it is closely associ- ated with it. The chairman is Baroness Blackstone. The sec- retary is Dr John Eatwell, eco- nomic adviser to Mr Neil Kin- nock. Its trustees include Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general trade union. Labour would do well to acknowledge the central propo- sition in the IPPR book. This is that, in Dunning's celebrated motion of 1780, \"the power of the executive has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished\". These words describe the fundamental flaw in Britain's system of govern- ment. An abiding commitment to crude parliamentary sover- eignty and the exercise by min- isters of the royal prerogative has led to what Lord Hailsham called, nearly two centuries after Dunning, the \"elective dictatorship\". Papmer revlS:Ii The IPPR would, in effect overthrow that dictatorship by means of a paper revolution. The new written constitution wwid rplace the supemay of pr lat as the tufhnata oorce of authority. The mon arhy would stay as a dignlld bead M cstate, but the royal pre regative waoul m longer eiast The Commons would be elected for flxed four-yeaw Im ma an e addlitional men her sylem of voting used to aO u . The Lords would be apimaodb a Seate elected by h stagle trauerable vote. Legislative power would be shared between parliament and regional assemblies for Scot- land, Wales, Northern Ireland and the 12 English regions; these would be financed by a share-out of the proceeds of a centrally-determined income tax. In short, the institute has postulated a complete and abrupt change of the way in which Britain governs itself. Its aim is to stimulate debate by presenting a draft constitu- tion. Against this background the various proposals can be seen as try-ons: not one of the 50 persons involved in debating and drafting the report agrees with everything in it Sham proposals Taken as a whole, however, the IPPR constitution exposes Labour's existing constitu- tional proposals as a sham. Mr Kinnock's party would devolve legislative authority to Scot- land and the regions and replace the Lords with an elected body, but the central pillars of power - a sovereign Commons elected by first-past- the-post and a cabinet able to rule by crown prerogative - remain in place. The Conserva- tive position, which is that there is no problem to address, is understandable but it is not intellectually respectable. There is no popular agitation in favour of constitutional change, but the current cli- mate of ideas would support a serious debate. The east Euro- peans and Russians are in a ferment of constitution-build- ing there must be some fall- out in the United Kingdom. The IPPR has made a solid contribution, but it has left oe important question unan- swered: bow is the revolution to be enginered? The istitute envisages a constitutial con- vention followed by a referen- dum, but that begs the ques- tion of whether parliament should, or would, asctkin the procss Thmen ev if a referen- dam gave a poilthe answr, the existing arliment would still be required, like the Supreme Soviet, to liquidate Itself In favur at a succeuor body.

Anxiety about the plight of those -people dependent upon the underbelly of the credit business - usually individual money-lenders operating fromi pubs and clubs and by word of mouth - has'prompted a year- long investigation by the Ofice of Fair Trading. The OFT has been trying to establish the nature and extent of extortionate credit in the UK and to see what further mea- sures could be introduced to stamp it out. Its findings are due in the next two weeks. The loan sharks that have been the subject of this inquiry are distinct from the legiti- mate, licensed money-lenders that deal with customers who might have difficulty borrow- ing from the banks. Most of the loan sharks' cus- tomers have little idea of the real cost of borrowing, even when it is extortionate, because they focus only on the regular cash payments.. Beyond the banks and finance houses, as many as 3m people on low incomes rely for small, short-term loans on licensed money-lenders charg- ing high annual percentage rates. (The APR is the standar- dised method of calculating debt service payments, includ- ing charges, as the equivalent of the annual interest payable on a fixed capital sum. All lenders must by law quote the APR for their loans. This is calculated by formulae avail- able from the OFT.) A recent survey in Birming- ham of licensed companies which collect debts on the doorstep found APRs averag- ing between 300 and 400 per cent. The legitimate, collectable credit sector in the UK is domi- nated by quoted companies such as Provident Financial Group of Bradford, Cattles (Holdings) of Hull and London Scottish Bank of Manchester. High overheads and high bad debt ratios mean that profit margins are generally unexcep- tional, even though APRs charged range from about 90 per cent to 200 per cent. S & U Stores of Birmingham, another quoted consumer credit spe- cialist, imposes charges nearer 400 per cent on some loans. London Scottish has 1,600 part-time collectors and makes cash advances averaging Â£200 to people usually rejected by banks and finance houses. Mr Neil Copson, a director, quotes average APRs of 90 per cent - \"the rate for the job\" in a high- risk business. He rejects the description of his business as a lender of last resort: \"We only accept 15 per cent of applicants and the rest then work their way down the list of lenders; the lower they go the higher the risks and so the bigger the cost.\" No such calculations trouble those operating outside the law and the licensing system, how- ever. Horror stories abound of people borrowing from loan sharks at penal interest rates to pay off other loans. Some *' '*Â»2-WW\"<7 *??\".* T *T-'''? l:*\"\\*''*: l.'i'*\"\". \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t have borrowed just to pay the poll tax. Incidents of illegal harassment by lenders are widespread but hard to prove. Old abuses persist, such as the retention and cashing in of allowance books by lenders so as to ensure repayment. The director-general of fair trading has cited cases of loans at annual percentage rates as high as 14 million in the case of small loans with repayments arranged at high frequency. Mr Kevin Mitchell, senior trading standards officer in Birmingham says his team has often encountered deals with APRs of over 1 million per cent. In Nottinghamshire Mr Alan Street, head of trading stan- dards has a seven-man team to combat illegal lending and credit abuse, which he says is rife: \"You borrow Â£50 cash and agree to pay back Â£100 at Â£5 a week. They keep Â£5 as the first payment, so you get Â£45 and owe Â£95. What sort of a deal is that?\" But the government faces a dilemma in considering an issue which is as old as money- lending itself. How can the bal- ance be protected between bor- owers and lenders' rights and obligations in any new propos- als aimed at eliminating the worst offenders? And where, in the continuing absence of any widely applicable judicial rul- ing, is the line to be drawn between extortionate and acceptable interest rates? The legitimate consumer credit business is controlled via a licensing system operated by the OFT. Last year nearly all the 25,367 consumer credit licences applied for were granted while 63 were revoked. The OFT says it has no record of how many of the 290,000 businesses given licences between 1976 and the end of 1990 are still trading. Though no amount of legisla- tion will stop the loan shark, illegal lenders face fines and possible jail sentences. They may also have their loan busi- ness completely written off. Most licensed operators remain in business because they strike bargains which are deemed fair by their custom- ers. A licence, however, does not guarantee borrowers free- dom from excessively expen- sive loans. Mr Chris Baines of the Bir- mingham Settlement, a charity tackling inner-city deprivation, has on his books allegations about a local, licensed credit broker charging an APR of 4,800 per cent. Four years ago, the same business was expelled from the Consumer Credit Association for imposing similar rates. The fact that the broker in question is still licensed and in busi- ness, though operating under two new trading names, must cast doubt on the policing abil- ities of trading standards depa tments a rd'se OFT.,d tone rei isbit :xarerot rteki nn thnek e are fe amendA t o Mr MEdward Leigh, s commornplace rarely seem to have ost factualhad-pressed borrow AltheOFT has acknowlendings o extort sonate credit are not yet 'known; there are few expetative as thato beit ill recom- pmenda to Mr Edward Leigh, consumer Credit Acti minister, sig- nificant; firther protection for tho give most hard-pressed boan armouryow ers.a The OFT has acknowledged that some credit remains so rexpeditsive as to be socially harmful. Nonetheless it appears reluctant to upset the can ask ental code on credit eand alteshrined 17 years ago in a Consumer Credit Act, intended to give borrowers an armoury of safeguards. The most likely move will be a change in regulations mak- ing it easier for extortionate credit deals to be challenged in the courts. At present, only borrowers can ask the courts to reopen and alter agreed deals but few appear aware of their rights or want to risk alienating lenders they may need in future. There is widespread backing from consumer and credit organisations for measures which would allow the OFT and trading standards officers to take the initiative in chal- lenging a credit bargain in court. A proposal that lenders involved in proven cases of extortionate interest charges could sethe d loan cancelled could also be taken up. Suggestions forsed killing off the extortionate rates include a universal cap on interest rates or a requirement for lenders charging particularly high rates to secure a special licence. But the danger is that inter- est charges would gravitate towards any imposed maxi- mum and that some legitimate lenders would, given their costs, be squeezed out of busi- ness. In parts of the US and in Ireland, where rate ceilings exist, the majority of lending at the bottom end of the credit market has gone underground. Other suggested remedies extend to the provision of state funds for social lending, though on more generous and broader terms than under the present social fund, which makes loans to those on bene- fit in order to buy fundamental household items and clothing. Moves to encourage the spread of credit unions, in which loans funded out of members' contributions are made at low or nil rates of interest, have also been suggested. Mr Les Cottrell collects small loans struck at interest rates touching 100 per cent on the shabby doorsteps of Mon- sall, Manchester. He has no doubt that his licensed employer helps provide a valu- ablfrom people service to those customers which mainstream lenders will not touch. \"The majority of people, whatever their circumstances, make a deal and stick to it. It would be disastrous if they were stopped from borrowing from people like us. It would just mean many more would be at the mercy of those who will always get round the law\".",

But times have changed. Look at the first two of the four conditions the Dutch propose for membership of the fastgroup of early Emu members, and a sneaking doubt arises. Condition one is a high degree of price stability, measured by a level of inflation close to that achieved by the member with the best performance on prices. Next year, German is likely to be around 5 per cent while France and Britain achieve 3 per cent levels. Is that close enough?

   "text_content" : "Andrew Fisher talks to VW's director for the environment A t the Frankfurt motor show, where glamour and performance vie with ecology and safety as sell- ing points for new cars, one of the most sought-after execu- tives last week was Mr Ulrich Steger, Volkswagen's new director for the environment. As the first European car producer - and the first big German company in any sector - to appoint a board member with solely \"green\" responsibil- ities, VW is acutely aware of the contradiction between Ger- mans' love of cars and their equally passionate care for the environment. Today's new models are mostly safer, more economical and less inimical to the envi- ronment, and car makers put a lot of effort into getting this across. Not everyone is con- vinced. Greenpeace erected a hoarding opposite the show entrance. \"The killers of our climate,\" it says next to the names of German car makers. This extreme viewpoint is one with which Mr Steger will have to deal, though not all critics of the car are so outspo- ken. He says he is known any- way as \"stubborn and fond of conflict\". The 47-year-old busi- ness school professor was Social Democratic economics minister in Hesse when the state had a red-green (SPD- Green coalition). This political background will come in use- ful, too. What does he think about Germans' attitudes to cars and the environment? And what can he achieve in VW, which is committed to making profits, however pronounced its envi- ronmental conscience? Sipping a glass of Sekt above the VW stand, he has a quote from Frankfurt-born Goethe ready to hand: \"Mankind is a contradiction\". Thus \"we have environmental awareness on the one hand and the pleasure of driving fast on the other\". He describes environmental protection as an innovative challenge. \"It does not mean sacrificing quality, safety, and, perhaps, driving pleasure.\" Mr Steger is keen to draw environmental activists into a proper debate, so they share responsibility for deciding how future vehicles should be pow- ered and do not just attack the car. VW's new Golf is more economical than its predeces- sors and is safer. Its manufac- ture includes fewer environ- mentally harmful or wasteful materials and processes. VW has also pledged to take back the new Golf free of charge for recycling at the end of its life. This, says Mr Steger, should enhance its second- hand value. Thus consumers can work out that it pays to take care of the environment. There is also an eco-Golf, still in the test phase, with fuel savings of 25 per cent achieved by a device which automati- cally switches off the engine when the car is immobile in stop-start urban traffic. Such efforts show how far Golf: toewer harmful materials VW and others have felt obliged to go to satisfy calls for more environmental responsi- bility in industry. Mr Steger, whose new job covers only the VW marque and not the group's Audi, Seat and Skoda subsidiaries, believes produc- ers must adopt a more all-em- bracing approach to the envi- ronment if they are not to be confronted by stiff new laws. In turn, he expects this to bolster his status in VW. \"The strength of my position is the basic understanding at VW as the leading car producer in Europe that it also has to be number one in environmental protection if it is to remain successful in the long term.\" One law that would be anathema to car executives, but which is again being dis- cussed, is a speed limit on Ger- man motorways. The car industry argues that the ability to drive at high speeds spurs companies to superior techno- logical efforts. This, companies claim, is appreciated by pur- chasers. Mr Steger is circumspect on the issue. On a speed restric- tion, he does admit: \"It must come.\" He then says, as his corporate line, that \"my per- sonal opinion is different from the official position of the car industry\". Like its rivals, VW is work- ing on new concepts to save fuel, ease urban congestion and promote safety. One exhibit in the study stage is the Chico, powered by a combi- nation of electric motor (for short rides) and petrol-driven propulsion (for greater dis- tances). Mr Steger also intends to become involved with local authorities to help them develop integrated transport policies - involving buses and trains as well as cars. Again, the feeling is that without such efforts, the car will become - and, to some environmental- ists, already is - the scapegoat for urban transport ills. Within VW, the new board member intends to promote greater environmental aware- ness across the board, an example being the use of more energy- and materials-saving processes in the production stage. \"All companies, not just VW, have to learn how to deal with environmental matters efficiently.\" Much of his task will be educational, he says. \"If I'm very good, my job will be superfluous in 10 years.\"",

I do not wish to suggest in any way that her piece was factually incorrect; it was not. I do feel however that it was balanced against MEPC and Alban Gate in a way which was both unjustified and potentially misleading. No one denies that the mar- ket is in bad shape but there are signs of improvement, and this has been shown by the recent considerable interest from occupiers now that the project nears completion and can be seen in all its glory. It is of course our challenge to con- vert that interest into lettings. Let me finish by posing a question. What would you rather be offering to the mar- ket today - a standard specifi- cation City office scheme sur- rounded by many others of a similar nature, or Alban Gate at 125 London Wall, which has: * A strong image (a true land- mark); * A variety of floor sizes (from 5,000 to 30,000 sq ft); * An interior committed to providing the occupants with an interesting working envi- ronment; * A \"state of the art\" techni- cal specification.

   "text_content" : "Peter Bruce on th e f'ti i ftionaligtti s i east Europe on the push for devolution in Spain Sers a And th6pctae was Joined this year by some unusual guests: two Lithuanian MPs and the deputiy mayor of Ju- blana, capital of the newly. inpendent Yugoslav republic of SlOVea... The event illustrated how the collapse of the Soviet Union 'and the secessionist movements in Yugoslavia is helping to arouse political stir- rings in 'the far corners of Europei Ripples from the east are prqmpting leaders of the countryfs 17 autonomous regIons: to hammer ever more loudly on the door of the cen- tral government in Madrid, demanding more money and a faster transfer of political power from the centre, and in some cases calling into ques- tion the country's very unity. So far, the response from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's Social- ist prime minister, has been to do very little - understanda- bly perhaps. For the process threatens to weaken the brittle and haphazard system of regional government that has underpinned Spanish democ- racy since 1978. The latest clash between the centre and the regions is mainly a row about money. But even in this sense, it con- fronts Madrid - struggling to reconcile stubbornly high infla- tion with a desire to bring the economy closer into line with those of its European Commu- nity partners - with a delicate dilemma. The government is already spending vast sums on the regions in order to buy internal peace ; indeed, the Bank of Spain bluntly blamed spending by the autonomous regions for the fact that the 1991 budget deficit had overrun by close to 50 per cent by June. But there is more to the regional leaders' demands. Fol- lowing EC recognition of the Baltic republics and amid growing sympathy for the plight of Croatia, mainstream leaders from Catalonia and the Basque Country have revived calls for \"self-determination\", implying the right to opt for independence. \"The August revolution [in the Soviet Union] affects every- one,\" insists Mr Miguel Roca, leader in the Cortes (parlia- ment) in Madrid of Spain's third largest party, the Catalan nationalist Convergencia i Uni6 (CiU). \"We are in atten- dance at the burial of central- ism. It is dead. The problem here is whether the Socialists \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t realise what has happened. The issue may be philosophical at the moment but in a few years it will become practical.\" Maybe it will not take that long. The Socialists have half the seats in the Cortes. Should Mr Gonzalez lose one more in a general election - the next is due in October 1993 at the lat- est - he might have to depend on parties such as the CiU or the Basque PNV for support in Madrid. The current debate has been building for years. Both Catalo- nia and the Basque Country enjoyed some autonomy before Franco took control of Spain in 1939 and imposed rigid central- ist rule nationwide. They demanded the return of their autonomous status as soon as he died in 1975, with rapid results. Devolution quickly came to be seen as the key to democracy and by the time the Catalan government, the Generalitat, had been restored in 1977, most Spanish regions were pressing for powers from Madrid. The result was the hastily negotiated 1978 consti- tution, which laid the founda- tions for a semi-federal state and saw Spain through an attempted coup and into the EC. The problem is that the document is vague in some key areas - notably on limits to regional autonomy. Between 1979 and 1981 four regions - Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia (which also has its own lan- guage) and Andalucia - were rapidly granted autonomy. The remaining 13 took a slow route, being allowed full autonomy only after five years. In no case was autonomy to be taken as implying independence. Spain had thus become a bastard federation - Aragon had slightly more status than an English county council and the Basques and Catalans just less than a German Land. The Basque Country collects all its own taxes, while the Catalans cannot but want to; the Cata- lans have wider powers to use their language than the Basques. The untidiness of these arrangements reflected size- able disparities between the regions. In many regions there had never been any demand for autonomy or any strong sense of separate identity. Some, like the Madrid region, were wholly artificial cre- ations. Country-wide devolu- tion was an attempt to forge, out of utterly different circum- stances, a seemingly coherent policy for all Spain. It was an arrangement imposed from aoove. That is why the politics of autonomy in Spain has been so easily ruffled by eastern Europe. The so-called \"slow track\" regions are now free to opt for full autonomy, and want greater powers. Catalonic and the Basque Country are complaining about delayed implementation of their auton omy statutes. The worry for Madrid is that it will soon be having to contend with 13 or more separate sets of auton- amy negotiations in which regions compete to achieve similar powers. The creativity of the Spanish government is thus about to be seriously stretched. Mr Gonz- 4lez needs to keep the Catalans and the Basques feeling special - they can both claim to be nations with unique cultures and they are Spain's most industrialised regions. But he also made a vague promise in his State of the Nation address last March to negotiate a pacto auton6mico with the 13 \"slow route\" regions in order to find an orderly way to increase their powers. For this promise to retain bete the centre e the to expire- a d ns hi 4tar woVpe time. M i ihvigtociaw back its 1991 budget overrun and is p a\"lulng Atigt budget next Dutthe qegions are becom- ing more and mor expenyve. Tnuanfers from the centre to the reginse grew by 21 per cent in theirt half 1ftthls year and spending by the regions them- selves has grown to the equiva- lent of 9.4 per cent of gross domestic product from less than 1 per cent in 191. The regional authorities have also been borrowing heavily on their own account; their total debt has grown from $1.2bn in 1984 to $llbn now. Small won- der that Madrid has been vigor- ously pressing the EC for the creation of a new compensa- tion fund to channel more Community money its way. The pressures on Madrid are enormous. This year the gov- ernment will pay out about $Sbn to subsidise regional pub- lic television channels; it is spending heavily on infrastruc- ture projects ahead of the 1992 Olympics to be held in Barce- lona, and pumping $8bn into Andalucia to prepare for the 1992 World Exposition in Seville. If this is political bribery, it may no longer be working. In May the Socialists lost Seville and Valencia in local govern- ment elections to regional par- ties; the regionalists also made impressive gains in Navarre and Aragon. The true extent of the pres- sure on the government may become clearer later this month as a result of initiatives by radical parties to the left of the nationalist governments in Catalonia and the Basque Country. The Catalan Esquerra Republicana plans to force a debate in the regional parlia- ment on independence. In the Basque Country, radicals plan to place motions before all town councils calling for inde- pendence. In all probability, the votes will not greatly upset the sta- tus quo. But they will raise the intensity of autonomist feeling throughout the country. Spain is already a difficult enough place to govern and Mr Gonz- Alez will probably do the sensi- ble thing and keep his head down. It is the best way he knows of deflecting any inten- sification of regionalist pres- sures.",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "Frm Mr Alex Zeytounian. Dear Sir, Ariane Genillard's report from Nagorno-Karabakh (\"Deadlock in an embattled enclave\", September 11) reads like a propaganda handout from the Azerbaijani govern- ment. The views of the Arme- nian majority are virtually ignored. This is perhaps not surprising since her visit appears to have been organised by the authorities in Baku. Firstly, the Karabakh Armenians have always advo- cated a peaceful solution to the crisis based on the principles of democracy and self-determi- nation. In 1988, the regional parliament voted to leave the control of Azerbaijan after decades of colonial misrule. But, instead of dialogue, the regime in Baku chose to reply with anti-Armenian pogroms in Sumgait, Kirovabad and Baku and blockades against Karabakh and Armenia itself. Armenian self-defence groups came into existence after two years of appeasement by Moscow of anti-Armenian violence and threats by Azer- baijani leaders to drive the Armenian majority out of their homeland. The Soviet army's response to this was to drop all pretence of \"neutrality\" and to openly collaborate with Azer- baijan. Since May, Soviet and Azerbaijani helicopter gun- ships and tanks have uprooted 10,000 Armenians, murdering over 120 in the process. An international delegation led by Baroness Cox which vis- ited the region in May and again in July found evidence of systematic violation of human rights against Armenians in Karabakh and adjoining Arme- nian districts of Azerbaijan. Emptied Armenian villages had been taken over by Azer- baijani settlers. Armenian concerns over Karabakh should be seen in the context of the complete colonisation of Nakhichevan. This is located inside Armenia and, like Karabakh, was handed to Azerbaijan after the Stalin-Ataturk pact of March 1921. Armenians see the take- over of Nakhichevan and the aggression against Karabakh as part of a pan-Turkish cam- -paign that has already resulted in the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in Turkey. Nagorno-Karabakh has as much right to self-etermina- tion as Azerbaijan itself. Fail- ure to uphold the democratic rights of the Armenian major- ity means condoning the forc- ible change of boundaries and encouraging continued blood- shed and suffering.

   "text_content" : "From Mr Martin AngeL Sir, The 1988 Housing Act and the introduction of Busi- ness Expansion Scheme assured tenancies have helped to create a new market in houses and flats to let. Through BES alone, in excess of 10,000 homes are estimated to have been provided. The availability is considera- bly swollen by large numbers of owner occupiers and devel- opers who cannot sell (at their perception of value) in the cur- rent depressed housing mar- ket, opting to let their property instead. Suddenly, and for the first time since 1939, prospective tenants are finding a choice of properties at competitive rent- als. However, when the market for sales improves, it is reason- able to assume that much of this short-term stock will be withdrawn. When the BES schemes are five years old, most investors will want to realise their investments, but perhaps they could be persuaded to postpone sales if rental income were allowed to be tax-ftee, even if only for two or three years. This would help to underpin what is still a fledgling market and is important not least because the development of a broad and sustainable rental market would enable signifli- cantly greater mobility of the country's workforce.

So there is no doubt that there will soon be a big boom. The only question is: when will it happen? The future of video communication started with the fiut video link between Leipzig and Berlin. But that was back in 1936, more than 50 years ago. Has mankind made a lot of progress in the meantime? Yes, because we have developed the video phone, video communication systems for professional applications and conference studios, stationary and mobile, and of all sizes. Video messages can now be tranitted worldwide. National and international video communication netrworl are becoming denser and more efficient all the time. And step by step video communication is making increasing inroads particularly with large companies. But the big boom in video communication is still to come. Will video coamunniation spread quickly and powerfully, just like a big bang? With ISDN? With direct-dial broadband networks? With CCITT standard H.261? Perhaps one of the new technologies Philips is working on will provide the final breakthrough. For example video transmissions from PC to PC.

   "text_content" : "Affairs. The hope is to end a running battle for the IEA's soul between its present direc- tor, Graham Mather, and its two founder presidents, Lord (Ralph) Harris and Arthur Sel- don, with Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool egging on the latter group. The trustees have expressed their confidence in Mather. But at a meeting next week they hope to appoint additional dis- tinguished and reassuring members who would enable the two founders to resume their association. Damage will, however have already been done in strength- ening the misconception that free-market ideas are are best discussed in terms of the inter- nal politics of the Conservative party. Press comments have already linked the longstand- ing complaints to the Charity Commissioners of Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours that the IEA is a Conservative front organisation with the com- plaints of Lord Harris - an enthusiastic Thatcher sup- porter and Bruges Group chair- man until last week - that the IEA is too close to John Major. It would take months to investigate all the allegations and counter-allegations that occur when internal dissen- sions arise among a small group of previously like-minded people. Briefly, several different squabbles have come together. One is the concern of Arthur Seldon, the editorial director for several decades, to maintain stan- dards. The studious and thor- oughgoing Seldon needs to be distinguished from that prince of intellectual entrepreneurs, Ralph Harris. Seldon's per- sonal leanings have been Lib- eral, although more towards Lord Grimond than anything more recent. As a longstanding believer in exchange rate disci- pline, he has never shared the Thatcherite enthusiasm for I lo not want discourage irists, gos- columnists d the like; t moves are oot to itore peace the trou- think tank, Economic floating rates. But Seldon has always been worried that Mather - who will have to spend the rest of his life aton- ing for the fact that he read Law rather than Economics as an undergraduate - would be too interested in matters of political concern to concen- trate on fundamental long-term issues. Seldon's broadsides are said to have begun even before Mather took office; and I am reminded of Bruno Walter's habit of starting rehearsals by saying: \"Already it is too loud\". The warnings about the dangers of being bogged down in immediate issues and in the \"politically possible\" have been very necessary, but as much towards Harris as towards Mather. For one to call the other too political is like the pot calling the kettle black. For instance, Mather has been accused of publishing papers in favour of a citizen's charter, which are in fact The intensity of the dispute reflects the squabbles surrounding Mrs Thatcher's departure based on lectures he started giving in 1987. Lord Harris, even though he sits on the cross benches, is the founder of the Conservative No Turning Back group, which frequently met in the IEA as the TV cam- eras discovered during the Tory leadership contest. My impression is that there has been pretty much the same spread between topical publica- tions and more recondite inves- tigation under both regimes. Mather is criticised for asking John Flemming, the former economic director of the Bank of England, whether it was worth pushing the case for an independent central bank - as if this were giving the Bank of England a veto, rather than an unfortunate faFon de parler in which most of us engage in probing policy advisers. The dispute could not, how- ever, have reached its recent intensity without the artificial- ly-linked syndrome of issues related to the UK exchange rate, the political future of the EC and Mrs Thatcher's depar- ture from Number 10 Downing St. These were highlighted by the letter of the \"Liverpool Six\", headed by Professor Pat- rick Minford early this year, pushing for interest rate cuts even at the expense of the UK's ERM commitment. The background to the letter was the failure of a now defunct IEA \"Shadow Mone- tary Policy Committee\" to agree on a letter which all members could sign. Minford's fury was particularly kindled by an interview which Mather gave to the Daily Telegraph, in which the latter criticised the letter for risking unsettling the markets to no good purpose. Tempers were not helped by the interpretation of these remarks as a rebuke to Min- ford for writing the letter rather than a personal expres- sion of economic opinion of the kind in which Harris has never been slow to indulge. I must, however, declare an interest. As the author of an IEA study, How to End the Monetarist Controversy, I hoped I could help to bring out the common ground between those who preferred an exchange rate target and those who wanted to target the domestic money supply - an issue depending on time and place rather than eternal veri- ties. Minford was however determined to block my mem- bership of the Committee. As a check on any bias of my own, I therefore contacted Peter Jay, whom no one would accuse of being a member of John Major's kitchen cabinet, and who out-Thatchers Thatcher in his opposition to fixed exchange rates and EC \"federalism\". His immediate reaction was that although he did not agree with everything written, there had been a \"use- ful widening of the publishing\" agenda under Mather and that it was absurd to build huge personal animosities on differ- ences on monetary and exchange rate policy. Neither of us should have needed to wonder if it would have been easier to bring together Serbs and Croats than the advocates of internal and external monetary constraints."

   "text_content" : "By Angus Foster in Hong Kong THE UNITED Democrats of Hong Kong, outspoken critics of China, appeared early today to have swept to victory in yes- terday's first direct elections to the colony's law-making coun- cil. The party, led by lawyer Mr Martin Lee, won five of the first eight seats announced. Of the other three, two were won by candidates closely linked to the party and campaigning on similar pro-democracy and anti-China platforms. The United Democrats, which gained prominence for attacking China following the 1989 Tiananmen Square kill- ings and for urging full democ- racy in Hong Kong, looked set to win about 10 of the 18 seats on offer. Other liberal candidates are likely to win most of the rest, according to exit polls. Pro- Beijing and pro-business candi- dates appear to have done badly. But Britain and China, keen to defuse calls for more democ- racy, will point to a lower- than-forecast turnout rate as evidence that Hong Kong peo- ple remain ambivalent about faster political reform. Although nearly 60 per cent more people voted than in any previous district-level election, the overall turnout of just under 40 per cent was below expectations. The rest of the 60 seats in the council have been filled by indirect election by trade and business associations or by government appointment. The pro-democracy grouping liberals will form Hong Kong's first opposition political force. They will use their grassroots credentials to call for wider social issues to be addressed and to criticise the Hong Kong and Chinese governments. The council, in the past little more than a rubber stamp, is expec- ted to become more vocal and influential. Only one of four pro-China candidates, who have the back- ing of Chinese organisations in Hong Kong, stood a chance of victory, according to the exit polls. The low turnout was blamed on apathy and confusion about what the elections will mean. Executive power will remain in the hands of the colonial gov- ernment and a close group of advisers. Because only a minority of the seats in the council were directly elected, the voters were in effect elect- ing an opposition rather than a government. Mr Michael Suen, secretary for constitutional affairs, hinted at the expected Chinese response, saying the turnout \"may be interpreted in some quarters that Hong Kong is not interested in democracy\". Mr Lee, who seemed certain of victory in the East Hong Kong Island constituency, said the turnout was \"very respect- able\". He said 20 per cent of registered voters were no lon- ger able to vote since they had emigrated or moved house. Mr Lee has been branded by Beijing as a subversive, in common with several other UDHK members. China and Mr Lee will now have to decide whether to continue to ignore each other or forge an uneasy truce. Under an agreement reached between China and Britain, the proportion of directly elected seats will slowly rise to fill half the council by 2007. The United Democrats have called for more democracy as a safeguard against Chinese interference in Hong Kong after 1997 when the colony will transfer to Chinese control, although Beijing has refused to consider further changes.",

Two opinion polls giving the Tories a lead of four and five percentage points have per- suaded even those ministers pushing for a general election next year that a November poll is now possible.

Mr Chris Fatten, Tory party chairman, was not at yesterday's meeting.

I'd wait to see what happens over the next few weeks. rd be encouraged because the trend has moved our way very significantly but there is a lot of good news still to come. I believe the economy is going to get a lot better.\" Tory morale has also been boosted by reports, which party officials refused to con- firm, that the wealthy Latsis shipping family have donated a substantial sum, perhaps as much as Â£2m, to the party. Labour tried to look unrattled by its decline in opin- ion polls, the result of an improved showing for the Lib- eral Democrats. Party leaders and strategists were adamant that when attention refocused on domestic issues the party would regain its lead. The prime minister had ben- efited from prominence on the international stage and diver- sions created by the Soviet Union and Middle East, Labour said. \"We were nine points ahead before John McCarthy [the British hostage] was released. People have not sud- denly turned against us,\" said one senior official. Labour also complained that Mr John Major's \"dithering\" over the election date was creating damaging uncer- tainty. However, party leaders were on the defensive over the poor personal standing of Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, compared with Mr Major. \"It is almost one of the sea- tures of British politics thiat a Labour leader, particularly one who's effective, comes under particular attack,\" Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, said on BBC radio. Apart political broadcast directed y Mr Hugh Hudson, the film-maker, on September 25 is expected to focus on Mr Kinnock in the hope of repeat- ing the success of a similar broadcast in the 1987 election. The shadow cabinet will meet tomorrow for its first strategy session since before the summer. In speeches today Mr Smith and Mr Kinnock will launch a counter-offensive against Tory claims that an economic recovery is begin- ning. The Harris poll in yester- day's Observer put the Conser- vative's on 43 per cent, Labour on 38 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 16. The ICM poll for the Sunday Express put the Tories on 41 per cent, Labour at 37 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 17."

   "text_content" : "By Robert Taylor in Stockholm THE SWEDISH government of Prime Minister Ingvar Carls- son is to resign today after the country's ruling Social Demo- crats yesterday suffered their worst result in a general elec- tion since 1928. Sweden appears set for a period of acute political insta- bility. The balance of power in the new parliament will be held by the populist, right- wing New Democracy party which took 6.6 per cent of the vote, according to television projections based on more than half the results. The arrival in parliament of New Democracy, with 24 seats, is sensational. The anti-tax, pro-alcohol party was formed less than six months ago. The election ended the domi- nance of the Social Democrats who have governed for 53 of the past 59 years, and the results showed a sharp swing to the right. But it will be diffi- cult to form a strong non- socialist government that can hope to last a full three-year term while Sweden has to negotiate entry into the Euro- pean Community and when the economy is in deep recession. Mr Carl Bildt, the Moderate party leader, will try to form a four-party non-socialist coalition, although their com- bined vote fell just short of an overall majority. Difficult nego- tiations between the parties lie ahead if he is to succeed. Mr Bildt's ally, Liberal leader Mr Bengt Westerberg, said fre- quently during the election campaign that he did not want to join any non-socialist gov- ernment dependent on the sup- port of New Democracy. Mr Bildt said he viewed the result as a \"mandate for change\". However, Mr Carls- son, who blamed the defeat on Sweden's economic problems, appeared last night to hold out the possibility of a coalition \"with the Centre and Liberal parties if Mr Bildt could not form a coalition. Mr Carlsson's Social Demo- crats took 37.9 per cent of the vote - down from 43.2 per cent three years ago - and 139 seats in the 349-strong parlia- ment. With the Left party, the former Communists, who polled 4.7 per cent and will have 17 seats, the left is likely to have a parliamentary block of 156 seats. The non-socialist block made up of traditional parties Moderates, Liberals, Centre and Christian Democrats - polled 46.2 per cent between them and looked set to have 169 seats, a handful short of an overall parliamentary major- ity. Mr Bildt's Moderates polled 21.7 per cent of the vote, against 18.3 per cent in 1988, and will have 79 seats. But the Liberals suffered a drop in Sealing his fate: Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson casting his vote yesterday their vote to 9.2 per cent from 12.2 per cent and secured 34 seats while the Centre party's share fell from 11.3 per cent to 8.0 per cent. The party will have only 29 seats. The Christian Democrats enter parliament for the first time in an impressive perfor- mance with 7.3 per cent of the vote and 27 seats. The Greens polled less than the 4 per cent needed to secure representation so the party will leave parliament after only three years. Turnout by voters was 85 per cent - the lowest since 1964.",

   "text_content" : "By Alan Canm in Opio, France GROUPE BULL of France, Siemens of Germany and Oli- vetti of Italy have started work on designs for a multi-million- dollar computer network to span Europe. The intention is to provide both an information technology infrastructure for the Continent and a boost for Europe's ailing computer com- panies. A memorandum of under- standing between the three companies was signed on August 31, and work on the detailed design has already started. The companies are anxious to persuade the Euro- pean Commission, which has yet to approve or agree funding for the project, that they can work together effectively. They are also anxious to head off attempts by other computer companies, based abroad but with a large Euro- pean presence, to secure the project. These include Interna- tional Business Machines, the world's largest computer man- ufacturer, and Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of Gen- eral Motors. The agreement to collaborate on a project of this scale is unprecedented among Euro- pean companies although they already work together in a series of research ventures. Mr Francis Lorentz, chief executive of Groupe Bull, told a meeting of processing profes- sionals from the US, Europe and Japan that collaboration on the network was an exam- ple of the way European com- puter manufacturers would have to learn to co-operate as well as compete if they were to return to financial health. He also hinted that within a few weeks Bull would announce collaboration with another large information tech. nology company. However, he ruledout any suggestion of a merger or acquisition. There is speculation that the company will be from the US as 5 per cent Group Bull's stock is already held by NEC of Japan. The plan for a European computer network - essen- tially a system of large comput- ers connected by telecommuni- cations links to provide a common nformation highway - was originally t forward by the Europen Commn s some years ago, but there has been little progres since then.

   "text_content" : "\"There's nothing to do here. They get fed up with just hang- ing around. Bound to want some excitement. And how else can they make any money?\" Thus the father of one of last week's rioters. Not an excuse, but an explanation of sorts; they've got to be stopped, but perhaps they aren't really to A lot of brokers and invest- ment bankers in London and New York and Tokyo must know just how the young car thieves and ram raiders of Newcastle and Oxford feel: there is all this glittering machinery, but it is hard to find an honest way to pay for it. Anyway, they mutter, the authorities are at bottom to blame for neglecting the infra- structure; they should have cracked down when it first became clear that once respect- able markets were becoming casinos. Note that markets now racked with scandal are the ones which suffered specu- lative excesses. That, perhaps, was the feel- ing that inspired the Tokyo authorities in drafting their new market regulations. There is a new SEC-like body to enforce good behaviour, with adequate powers of investiga- tion, but penalties that amount to a light slap on the wrist. However, it has been set up outside the formerly all-power- ful Ministry of Finance, much against its wishes. This completes the humilia- tion that began when the Bank of Japan tacitly declared its independence, and reversed the ministry-approved policy of cheap credit and so caused the losses for which select inves- tors were compensated. The Americans have a more robust attitude to wrongdoers, and there is now something of a reign of terror in the invest- ment houses. One after another, senior managers who are even suspected of stretch- ing the rules are being sacked by image-conscious manage- ments. Meanwhile, Congress is after the official supervisors. Com- mittees are competing to draft tighter laws, and one has now demanded to see the diaries and logs of every official in the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency and the deposit insurers who had any contact with BCCL They will get them, and publish them, no doubt. The softly-softly approach in London makes an odd contrast with all this activity. The aim, no doubt, is to protect confi- dence in the integrity of the markets, not to mention the prestige of the regulators. There is a riot squad of investi- gators at work, but they are invisible. This seems to me to By Anthony Harris be a high-risk strategy. The lack of high profile policing may help to explain the very thin trading which is making it so hard to earn an honest liv- ing, as it undoubtedly helps to explain why Tokyo is finding it so hard to recover. In any case, it is not just the supervisors who should be squirming through an inuisi- tion. The policy-makers have got away too lightly since Mr Nigel Lawson, by resigning for highly respectable reasons, made himself a scapegoat. Nobody has yet offered a plau- sible explanation of how the authorities managed to repeat The Americans have a more robust attitude to wrongdoers, and there is now something of a reign of terror in the investment houses. the mistakes of the early 1970s, which must be within the working memory of all the senior officials involved. That was a softly-softly epi- sode, too. The property market was obviously out of hand, inflated with easy credit, and the Bank did send out some letters. The lenders were fatally slow to respond, and in the interval those of us who were trying to act Cassandra were accused of hysteria. \"I can't think why you get so worked up,\" a senior director chided me at the time. \"After all, it's all in real values.\" The Treasury has its own hab- its of sloppy thinking and, on one subject, seems equally incapable of learning it is the failure to distinguish between investment and current spend- ing. Corporate treasurers are regularly pilloried for this fail- ure (especially when they declare capital profits as cur- rent income); but at the national level, it is taken for granted. Indeed, the whole questionable programme of pri- vatising utilities with virtual monopolies rests on this error: it is only private bodies whose investment is not constrained by the government's current spending. The latest example is the London Transport capital bud- get This is still a public ser- vice, so we are told we cannot afford the investment needed to make the network safe and efficient. However, the report from the Monopolies and Merg- ers Commission suggests that London cannot afford not to spend this money. Continued neglect will mean disruption at least, and possi- bly something like paialysis, as run down equipment finally breaks down; a waste, of money, and a heavy cost to the economy. Mr John Major, who may well be in power for some time, and whose heart seems to be in the right place, should be thinking through these prob- lems. He should ask his advis- ers to dig out the OECD studies which suggest that investment in the infrastruc- ture and in education have a higher rate of return than virtually any other kind - and for a good basic reason: this is the only form of capital which is infinitely adaptable to changing circumstances and technologies. It wins votes, too. Privatisation, now proposed for some trunk roads, can be a help in the right circum- stances, but that is no excuse for neglecting fundamental needs, or for subjecting the public sector to rules which make no sense in a private enterprise. The UK's most successful competitors certainly have highly effective companies; but thanks partly to Japanese tuition, the UK also has a growing number. Some, but not all, also have better- ordered financial markets. What really distinguishes them from the sluggish British and American economies, however, is much higher spending on infrastructure and education - and higher taxes to pay for it. This is really where we came in, though it looks quite differ- ent; for the persistent faults of British policy, which look sim- ply like bad accountancy (which also explains a lot of corporate sin) result in the end not just in financial strain and recession, but social strain and riots."

The EMS has been domi- nated by the D-Mark and the Bundesbank for as long as any- one can remember. Early ideas that the Ecu (European cur- rency unit) should be \"at the centre\" of the EMS were sup- planted by the reality of the D-Mark acting as the system's counter-inflationary anchor. It was a role that at first irritated the German monetary authorities but which later became a matter of pride for Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president. A fleet- ing visit to Frankfurt last week was sufficient to raise ques- tions as to whether this state of affairs can continue. One veteran observer of the European monetary scene said conditions in Germany now reminded him of Britain in '988, when the Lawson boom was under way.

   "text_content" : "By David White, Defence Correa ondent FERRANTI International is close to agreement on trfasferring its missile activities t.to te UK's General Electric Copapny as set. tlement for an outstanding sinan- dal claim. The transfer of activities belonging to Ferranti's aerospace systems division would resolve a dispute between the companies over the Â£270m GEC paid last year for Ferranti Defence Systems. The deal depends on a commit- ment from the United Arab Emir- ates on the final stages of a Isecet contract for air-launched 'bombs and missiles. This con. tract, worth more than Â£300m, is Ferranti's principal source of giuded-weapon business. 1G! C's purchase in early 199 of Ferranti Defence Systems, such as airborne radar, was crucial to the rescue of Ferranti after it was hit by a Â£215m fraud. But under the deal GEC was able to put the price to arbitration, claiming the ,Ferranti assets were overvalued. Last Friday, GEC announced 800 redundancies at the former Ser- ranti unit. The outstanding claim is believed to be around Â£45m. The proposed deal would save Ser- ranti from pressure on scarce cash resources and enable it to exit an export contract which has run into a payments deficit. GEC declined to comment on the negotiations, but it Is believed to have been near agree- ment for about two months. The company has been in dis- cussions in the UAE over pay- ments on the third phase of the Ferranti project. In the aftermath of the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, controlled by Abu Dhabi and its ruling family, there have been fears about how much the UAE is prepared to set aside for this and other defence con- tracts. The proposed handover to GEC follows the recent sale by Ser- ranti of the warheads and explo- sives operations of its Marquardt subsidiary in California to a spe- cially-formed company, MA Acquisition, for $15m (Â£8.8m). The UAE project was inherited by Ferranti from International Signal and Control (ISC), the US group it took over - with disas- trous copsequences - in 1987. Other mlisile contracts listed by ISC proved to be non-existent. Neither Ferranti nor GEC has been prepared to divulge infor- mation about the UAE deal. Both companies say the customer has insisted on secrecy. As prime contractor, GEC would be expected to maintain supplies from the Ferranti group but could involve other contrac- tors.

   "text_content" : "Nikki Tait reports on plans to overhaul the Philips white goods business by its US owner, Whirlpool National washing habits are of considerable con- cern to Mr Jan Prising, 18 months into the job of overhaul- ing Philips' European-based white goods business for its US owner, Whirlpool Corporation. He says: \"We believe that (the British) will accept top-loading washing machines instead of front-loaders. Or that the French will accept front-loaders instead of top loaders.\" This is startling considering the numerous cramped British kitchens, with appliances squeezed beneath precious sur- face space. But before such quibbles can be raised, Mr Prising, a Whirlpool executive vice-president visiting the US to attend a group board meeting, hastens to his broader point: \"So this is what we have been looking at - more common- ality, more standardisation, and a more common marketing approach.\" Only then does caution strike. \"Of course, this globalisation should not become a buzz-word; we have to consider that there ae still local idiis ctions.\" From Whirlpool s-jidint of view, Mr Prising had better be right. This marriage between America's largest manufacturer of large appliances and the for- mer Philips-run operation has been years in the making, and much is at stake. The US company first acquired 53 per cent of Philips in 1988 for $470m. It bought the remaining 47 per cent for about $610m (Â£361m) last June. As a result, about one-third of the group's $6.6bn sales were derived from Europe last year. Reasons for a substantial investment in Europe are simple. US HOME APPUANCES 1990 market shar* Whirlpool 32.8 GE 27.0 Electrolux (WCI) 17.2 Maytag 14.6 Raytheon 5.8 Others 2.6 *CIe w..nere and dep, refIeraee, Source: Appliance magazine Whirlpool shares the US market with four others -General Elec- tric, Maytag, Raytheon and Elec- trolux - and shows minimal growth. This year it declined sharply because of the recession. Analysts say competitive pres- sure in the US could Increase, although Mr Dave Whitwam, Whirlpool's chief executive, dis- putes this. The European market, by contrast, is divided among dozens of manufacturers and offers healthier, if scarcely buoy- ant, prospects. Mr Whitwam says: \"Europe will grow at a more significant rate in the white goods business than the US over the 1990s. Europe will see average annual growth of 2 to 4 per cent; the US perhaps 1 to 2 per cent.\" So, if this is to be a major motor for the group in coming years, how is Whirlpool tackling the former Philips business? The question is intriguing because Philips is overhauling its remain- ing businesses, slashing jobs and shaking up its lethargic corpo- rate culture to reverse years of lacklustre profitability. Presum- ably, Whirlpool inherited the inefficiencies which lay behind the Dutch company's decline. Analysts view the European challenge as a matter of margin improvement. Attention centres on Germany, which has powered the business lately but may be losing steam. Mr Nick Heymann, at County NatWest, says: \"It's a question of whether cost reductions from dis- tribution, marketing and so on, can offset local market weak- ness.\" To an extent, Whirlpool con- curs. Mr Whitwam has said that the aim is to increase margins on the former Philips business. But both he and Mr Prising empha- sise that this is not the entire game plan. Mr Whitwam says: \"What attracted us to the Philips white goods business was the base which it provided. It had a pan- European manufacturing system, pan-European distribution and pan-European brand awareness. What we are now doing is restructuring that to deal with the realities of the 1990s.\" It is less easy to elicit details of progress on this strategy, though the y has explained its brandi . These include a new \" l Whirlpool\" brand, without a hhen so the Philips name can be dropped when Whirlpool becomes accepted. In early 1991, marketing sup- port was restructured from country-by-country into two units - one to handle the Ger- man-origin Bauknecht brand, and the other for the Philips Whirl- pool, Ignis and Laden labels. The aim is to push this further. Mr Prising believes that the products can be standardised to a great extent, making few conces- sions to national prejudices. He maintains that up to 80 per \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t cent of prpduct lines could be unique to'one country but that this could be cut \"considerably\". Distribution, too, has moved from a national to a Europe-wide set-up. And Mr Whitwam points to duplications which could be eliminated, such as research and development. Mr Whitwam contrasts the manufacturing possibilities with Whirlpool's recent restructuring in the US. \"We've taken off 20 per cent of the manufacturing floor- space in the US. We will do that in Europe if it's necessary to maintain or improve our competi- tive position, but today we don't have any of those opportunities identified.\" He adds: \"The European busi- ness was more efficient than most people give it credit for - it had been through a significant rationalisation before we bought it. It was a business which had a healthy plant and capital struc- ture; the tooling and all those things were up-to-date.\" Both men are unwilling to set deadlines for completing the overhaul of Philips. Mr Prising talks about the problems of changing attitudes within Philips and the rapidly changing Euro- pean environment. Mr Whitwam is more helpful: \"Jan's process probably has an end-date about 12-18 months from now.\"",

   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "By Simon Londonl CREDIT LYONNAIS has raise-d w250m (Â£148m) of capital through an issue of variable rate notes, the first for nearly a year and a move which bankers hope will re-open a valuable source of capi- tal for international banks. Until last year the VRN mar- ket was one of the few reliable sources of capital for interna- tional banks, with $8bn issued over two years. However, con- cern over the deteriorating credit quality of many banks caused investors to desert the market. The last new issue was In October 1990. The Credit Lyonnais issue, arranged by Merrill Lynch Inter- national, underlines the determi- nation of banks to raise capita: in spite of difficult market condi- tions. The terms are the most generous seen on a VRN issue. Banks are under pressure to build capital resources to comply with the Basle accord on interna- tional bank capital adequacy from January 1993. The agreement sets a mini- mum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent. Half of this capital must be Tier I, comprising com- mon equity and preference shares. The rest can be Tier IE capital including subordinated instruments such as variable rate notes, reserves and certaiL provisions. Last week National Westmin- ster bank raised Â£140m and $200m of core capital through Issues of preference shares in the UK and US markets. The interest margin on vari- able rate notes is reset at regular intervals through an auction process. At each auction, note- holders either specify the inter- est margin at which they are pre- pared to hold the paper or opt to sell the bonds back to the \"*emarketing agent\", an invest- ment bank which manages the auction process. However, the cost of capital to the issuer is subject to an upper limit. If too many investors try to sell the bonds back to the remarketing agent the auction process is suspended and the notes pay the fall-back margin. The undated Credit Lyonnais issue pays an interest margin of 0.85 per cent over the three- month London interbank offered rate. If the auction process is suspended the notes revert to a fall-back margin of 1 per cent over Libor. The issue is cumulative - if interest payments are suspended they mount up for payment at a later date. The bank will pay interest on any suspended inter- est payments."

Mr Jim Cole, the Dowding chief executive, said Torday's Diesel Marine International (DMI) and Elfab Hughes engi- neering companies would fit well with existing businesses and that the loss-making Old- ham Signs would be sold. Dowding said that on Friday it bought 5.9 per cent of Tor- day's shares in the market at 63.5p. A spokesman for Torday said the board would meet this morning to consider the offer. He said that DMI, one of the world's largest refhrbishers of diesel engines, and Elfab Hughes, a maker of valves for the petro-chemical industry, were both profitable. County NatWest, the com- pany's brokers, expects Torday to incur a loss for the full year. At the interim stage it reported a pre-tax loss of Â£684,000 compared with a Â£1.52m profit in the compara- ble period in 1990. Pre-tax profits at Dowding and Mills fell 9 per cent to Â£5.11m in the six months to December. Mr Cole said Dowding had approached Torday last Octo- ber to talk about buying DMI. Dowding was told the com- pany was not for sale. In April, some institutions were surprised when Sir Mich- ael Carlisle, a non-executive director, sold half his stake in Torday & Carlisle at 150p only weeks before the company warned that losses would increase in the second half. The Torday spokesman said Sir Michael had no knowledge that a profits warning was to be made.

   "text_content" : "David White charts the history of Fe ranlti's largest remaining missiles contract T HROUfGH .all its trou- Wbes, Ferranti Interna- l has Wtried to main- tawi secrecy about one of the world's most puzzling arms coltracts. The fear has been ,that a burst of'publc.ity cuild cause the contract, involving a unique range of air-launched weapons for the United Arab Emirates, to fall through, severely damaging Ferranti's recovery efforts. The first official mention of the contract, worth more than Â£SOOm, came last year when Ferranti referred to \"a major and profitable contract to pro- duce a family of missiles for an overseas customer.\" Shrouded in mystery, the project known as Al-Hakim is the biggest single development and production contract held by Ferranti since it sold off the \"jewels\" of its business - including airborne radar - to GEC early last year. The project is almost Ser- ranti's only business remain- ing in missiles, following the RAF's decision to withdraw its ageing Bloodhound air defence missiles from service this year. Ferranti's ambition to develop its interests as a mis- sile manufacturer were central to the idea of taking over Inter- national Signal and Control (ISC) of the US in 1987. Buying ISC, which was built up and sold to Ferranti by Mr James Guerin, exposed Ferranti to a fraud costing it an estimated Â£215m. Now Ferranti is on the verge of transferring Its missile busi- ness, with tli UAE contract, to GEC as settlement for the excessive price GEC reckons it paid in its Â£270m purchase of Ferranti Defence Systems. The transfer depends on GEC being able to secure UAE finance for the third and most ambitious phase of the project. The early stages were funded by prepayments made to Ser- ranti in 1967 and 1988, but a cash deficit subsequently built up. Defence experts are astounded by the scale of the project for a small country like the UAE - a large number of weapons, including some with a capability beyond any that Britain's Royal Air Force pos- sesses. Even the project's title is a mystery. Ferranti says it has never known it as Al-Hakim. Under ISC, which is believed to have concluded the deal in 1984, it appears to have gone by the name of Alpha. Engi- neers at Dassault, the French aircraft company which has the task of fitting the weapons on the UAE's fighters, refer to it as the GMX project. The programme caused a James(;uerin: sold ISC to Ferranti in 1987 row between the UAE and the French because of the diffi- culty of incorporating the weapons on Mirage 2000E jets. French policy is to export air- craft with all weapons included. The UAE turned down alternative French weap- ons, and Mirage deliveries were delayed. Earlier this year two Mirages in desert camouflage belonging to the UAE's air force, were seen at Dassault's test centre at Istres in southern France being fitted with special laser \"pods\". The system being developed by Ferranti is described as more sophisticated than the AS.30 laser-guided air-to-sur- face missile which the French air force employed in the Gulf war. The RAF has been seek- ing a \"stand-off\" anti-armour weapon but has so far failed to obtain Treasury approval to fund development. The first two phases of the UAE programme involve 500- pound and 1,000-pound guided bombs, similar to some of the bombs used by allied forces to attack Iraqi military installa- tions. The third phase, adding a rocket motor, is thought to be similar to the US Maverick missile, made by Hughes Air- craft and Raytheon. This has been supplied to several other Middle East countries includ- ing Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt. U K Ministry of Defence officials raised ques- tions about the ISC/ Ferranti project in 1989. It is thought that ISC may have invented an additional, non-ex- istent contract with the UAE in parallel with the genuine deal - one of the series of pho- ney contracts involved in the fraud. According to a former senior official, the MoD intervened in early 1989 to alert the UAE authorities to its worries about the project. In particular, it was believed that South Africa was involved in developing the rocket motor for the missile. Ferranti representatives have, however, denied any South African connection. The programme has since been quietly going ahead, with deliveries proceeding for the first two stages. The weapons involve production both in the UK and in the US at Ferranti Aerospace Inc. Export licences are understood to have been issued by both governments. GEC has remained silent about its interest in taking over the project. However, the missile activities now concen- trated in Ferranti's Aerospace Systems division would clearly help the GEC-Marconi defence group to build up its own mis- sile business and its capacity to design whole weapons. Traditionally a supplier of guidance systems, GEC-Mar- coni is now seeking to enter the business as a prime con- tractor. In an alliance with Matra of France it is competing against British Aerospace to produce a new air-to-air missile for the RAF. It would also be a prime candidate to develop a stand-off anti-armour weapon if and when the UK decides it can afford one.",

   "text_content" : "Elys drops 36% to Â£203,000 ELYS (Wimbledon), the department store retailer, recorded a 36 per cent decline in profits in the half-year to August 3, citing the severe recession in the south-east of England and the increase in the rate of VAT as the mair causes. On a marginal increase in turnover from Â£5.58m to \"5.72m, pre-tax profits fell from \"318,000 to Â£203,000 in the period under review. Mr John Moyle, chairman and managing director, said there was still little evidence yet of an upturn in the non food retail sector. He warned that if there was no recovery in retail spending in the tradi- tionally stronger second half, there would be a substantial drop in this year's profits. Earnings per share declined to 11.2p (17.2p), the interim div- idend is however, maintained at 1.5p. Beradin advances to Â£56,000 Beradin Holdings, the rubber and palm oil producer, lifted pre-tax profits from Â£44,000 to Â£56,000 in the first half of 1991. Although the oil palm fresh fruit bunches crop fell to 7,576 tonnes (8,970), turnover in the period rose to Â£267,000 (Â£241,000). Estate profits were sharply up at Â£72,000 (Â£30,000), but a fall in interest receivable to Â£11,000 (Â£26,000) helped keep operating profits down to Â£96,000, a rise of only Â£15,000. Earnings edged ahead to 0.24p (0.2p) per share. Willis Corroon expands in US Willis Corroon, the insurance and reinsurance broker, has announced the acquisition of Facciani & Company and Sac- clani & Company of Nevada, actuarial and consulting firms based in Cleveland, Ohio and Nevada at a cost of around Â£3.5m. The deal is expected to strengthen Willis Corroon's presence in the mid-west. Berry Starquest net assets at 177.5p Net asset value per share at Berry Starquest, an investment trust managed by GT Manage- ment, stood at 177.5p at July 31 1991, compared with 190.6p a year earlier and with 143.2p at the January 31 year end. Profits before tax at the interim stage came through at Â£169,000, unchanged from the figure a year earlier. Earnings per share were, however, up slightly at 2.3p (2.1p). Again there is no interim dividend. Â£8m buy-out at Deans Farm Eggs Dalgety, the food and agribusi- ness group, is selling Deans Farm Eggs to a management team led by Mr Peter Dean, its chief executive. Total consideration for the net assets is Â£8m, of which Â£5m will be paid on completion and the remainder over four years. Thomas Walker falls 81% to Â£55,815 Pre-tax profits of Thomas Walker, maker of smallwares for the clothing industry, fell 81 per cent from Â£289,176 to Â£55,815 in the year to June 30 1991. Earnings per share declined to 0.38p (3.36p) and the direc- tors are recommending a reduced final dividend of 0.7p (1.22p) making 0.875p (1.48p) for the year.",

   "text_content" : "By Judy Dempsey TWO OF Austria's largest savings banks, Osterreichische Linderbank and Zentralspar- kasse, have agreed their long- awaited merger. The link will create the country's largest financial institution, with combined assets of US$40bn. It is also likely to make the country's banking system more competitive, on both the domestic and international markets. The new bank, which will be called Z-Landerbank, Bank Austria, and which will have more than 400 branches, will start operations on October 7. Domestically, the bank will dominate the retail market and the combination of the two will produce 1m customers. More than 36 per cent of Zentralspar- kasse's total liabilities con- sisted of savings deposits, com- pared with LInderbank's 17.9 per cent. Internationally, it will con- centrate on building up a pro- file in eastern and western Europe. Foreign business makes up almost 40 per cent of LAinderbank's total assets, com- pared with 19.5 per cent for Zentralsparkasse. The delay in finalising the merger, first mooted in 1988, hinged on reaching agreement on the allocation of shares. The Republic of Austria had held a 51 per cent stake in Liii derbank, but this will be reduced to 25 per cent because Landerbank will own half the new bank. In the case of Zentralspar- kasse, whose supervisory board is controlled by the City of Vienna, 58 per cent of the voting capital will be held by Antellsverwaltung-Zentralspar- kasse, the holding company of Zentralsparkasse, and 26 per cent of the voting capital by the Republic of Austria.",

The bank says the funds are aimed at western institutional investors, and will focus on those enterprises in central Europe already exporting to hard currency countries. The first fund, CA Hungary Investment Partners, which will initially amount to $75m, will invest in small and medi- um-sized unlisted companies and ventures in Hungary. Mr Robin Nydes, of Creditan- stalt Investments Interna- tional, says he is optimistic despite economic uncertainties such as last year's 5.6 per cent fall in GDP, an annual infla- tion rate of 30 per cent, and the collapse of trade with Com- econ, the former socialist trad- ing bloc. The CA Central Europe Fund, which is open-ended, will invest in medium to large companies or ventures. It will include the six countries of eastern Europe, Austria, Ger- many and Switzerland. The CA New Europe Equity Partners, which will range between DM50m and DMI00m, ($57m) will invest in estab- lished, but unlisted companies in Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. These companies will be selected for their inter- national growth potential. Mr Terence Webb, who is overseeing this fund, said it had been operating since last January because of rising interest among institutional investors. Despite the instability in the Soviet Union, the consensus among Creditanstalt and mer- chant bankers in London is that the rewards in investing in eastern Europe may begin to outweigh the risks.",

Royal, however, which has an 18.8 per cent stake in AMB, is struggling with losses and is assumed to be looking for a buyer for its holding.

In July, Northwest reached an interim agreement with Trump's banks, led by Citicorp, to operate the carrier for a fee for about 10 years. Mr Richard Cozzi, president and chief operating officer at the Trump Shuttle, said the end of discussions \"will have no impact on the operations of the Trump Shuttle\". Trump Shuttle said other parties had expressed interest in acquiring or managing the shuttle, and that airline offi- cials were optimistic that an arrangement could be reached quickly.

After starting with a daily volume of 7,098 contracts, it climbed to a daily volume of more than 12,000 contracts at the end of last week, and recorded a high last Tuesday of 14,454 contracts. By contrast, Liffe has indicated that its Italian bond futures contract was expected to show a daily volume of between 1,000 and 2,000 contracts initially. \"It is always very difficult to project volumes, but we know there is a need for a hedging instrument given the very strong cash market,\" the exchange said. Demand has been strong for an Italian futures contract in order to help traders and inves- tors hedge their positions, although there has been some speculative interest from local traders. In addition, the launch of the new Matif contract has been helped by the recent heavy volumes in the underly- ing cash market. Italy had one of the best-per- forming government bond mar- kets last week and showed record trading volumes, helped by keen buying interest from foreign investors. Foreigners have been tempted back into the Italian bond market on news that withholding tax pay- ments will soon be reimbursed.",

   "text_content" : "GILT yields continued their rall of recent weeks as more news emerged of lower infla tion in the UK. The gilt market was espe cially cheered by the announcement of the sharpest reduction in earnings growth across the British economy for nine years, a signal that core inflation is on the way down. Specialists in the gilt market took the view that, due to the disciplining effects on the economy of the exchange rate mechanism, this would not be a temporary fall, but that Britain would be locked into low growth in inflation f6r the foreseeable future. Buoyed by this outlook, investors pushed up prices for most classes of UK government bonds, with yields declining during last week by about 30 basis points (0.3 per cent). Compared with January 1991, before the recent gradual reduction in the base rate from 14 per cent to 10.5 per cent, yields for five-year gilts have declined particularly sharply, from about 10.7 per cent to around 9.4 per cent. Yields on 10-year bonds have slipped from 10.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent, while yields on gilts maturing 20 years from now have come down frop 10 per cent to about 9A.4 per cent. The yield curve during this period has evolved from being sharply inversed to its current flattened shape. Were it not for the fact that gilt investors have found gilts maturing around the end of this century rela- tively unattractive - the sac- tor responsible for the \"hump\" in the yield curve - then the slope in the curve would be virtually non-existent beyond the five-year stage. A big question for gilt inves- tors is how long the rally in the market will last. There is a substantial school of thought which says that the yield dif- ferential between UK and Ger- man 10-year bonds, which has narrowed by about 50 basis points in the past month and now stands at about 120 basis points, is unlikely to fall much more. According to this argument, yields of UK government bonds will start to rise again in the near future, possibly after the next general election, assum- ing one takes place soon. If this were to happen, it would be similar to the pattern of events in the gilt market immediately UK glls yhllds Restated at par (%) v.V 9.7 9.5 a a -0 10 years 20 30 Source: WaduBg Securiss before and after the 1987 gen- eral election. There was a further burst of speculation in the City last week that the Conservative party would be well positioned for victory in an early poll. That helped the general drift upwards in bond prices. However, it was the data on inflation that underpinned the downward movement in yields. According to Mr John Shep- perd, a bond specialist at S.G. Warburg, Britain is exper- iencing \"fundamental changes in the inflation outlook\". This assessment was backed up by three pieces of economic data: * Prices of manufactured goods at the factory gate rose by just 0.1 per cent last month, bringing the annual rate down to 5.6 per cenit last month, after 5.9 per cent in July. Excluding food, drink and tobacco items, where price movements are volatile, the rise was 4.8 per cent, the lowest since 1988. * The underlying yearly increase in the index of aver- age earnings across the econ- omy in July was 7.5 per cent, compared with 8 per cent in June. This underlines the downward movement in the rate of earnings growth which set in near the beginning of this year. *The annual rate of rise in UK retail prices last month was 4.7 per cent, the lowest level for three years. However, this owes more to the dropping out of the year-on-year calculations of last summer's petrol price rises, than to an across-the-board slowdown in prices this year. Peter Marsh",

   "text_content" : "AUSTRALIAN government bonds staged a minor rally last week as the secondary market digested a surprise 100 basis points cut in official cash rates at the beginning of the month. The benchmark Common- wealth November 2001 10-year bond ended the week at 10.63 per cent, falling 12 basis point- on the previous week, while the five-year bond closed at 10.37, down four basis points. The three-year bond, at 10.04, was also down four basis points. The rally was aided by a series of figures which indi- cated that the economy was close to emerging from the recession. The latter caused a contraction of 2.4 per cent in gross domestic product in the 12 months to the end of June. However, analysts are divided about whether the improvement heralds a resumption of the long rally in Australiar government secui.- ties, which has seen the 10 year bond yield fall nearly 4 per- centage points since early 1989. The long rally has been underpinned by a steady improvement in the inflation outlook, as the consumer prices index has fallen from more than 7 per cent to an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent - well below the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. In the latest phase, which began in late June, the yield on the 10-year bond fell from 11.31 per cent on June 26 to a low of 10.4 per cent shortly before the federal budget in early August. However, the rally appeared to run out of steam after the budget, and the 10-year yield climbed back to 10.75 per cent, reflecting the financial mar- kets' disappointment with the lacklustre performance of Mi John Kerin, the Treasurer. Analysts say Mr Kerin was probably hoping the 10-year yield would fall below 10.4 per cent, indicating a significant reduction in inflationary expec- tations and justifying a 1 per cent cut in official cash rates to 9.5 per cent. Mr Kerin's decision to ease monetary policy in spite of the rise in yields confused the mar- kets, especially since the Trea- sury held a A$1.5bn bond ten- der on the same day. In the event, the March 1994 and September 1995 bonds were well received, with weighted average yields of 10.06 per cent and 10.32 per cent, but the November 2001 bond was sold at a higher than expected average yield of 10.704 per cent. The tender was the third since April, when the govern- ment was forced by decreasing revenues to return to the domestic bond market after a two- year absence. The Trea- sury is expected to seek to raise about A$llbn this sinan- cial year. The outlook for the market is unclear. Mr Todd Richie, senior economist in the Com- monwealth Bank's financial markets group, thinks the eas- ing in monetary policy was probably ill-timed. If it triggers strong economic growth from mid-1992 onwards, with a com- mensurate increase in infla- tionary pressures, that would rule out a further significant rally in bond yields, he says. However, Mr Antonio Dot- tore, Citibank's senior econo- mist, says low inflation, politi- cal stability and a relative lack of exchange-rate risk has prompted strong overseas demand for government paper, especially from Japan. He fore- casts a sustained rally, with the 10-year bond falling by as much as 100 basis points. \"There is a lot of demand out there, and in terms of risk, this is a pretty good place to park your money,\" he says.

   "article_dc_title" : "Doubts Remain Despite Fed Easing",
   "_id" : "FTDA_1991_0916_0022_004",
   "text_content" : "ON FRIDAY the US Federal Reserve finally did what the markets had been anticipating, and politicians urging- it fur- ther eased monetary conditions with a half point cut in the discount rate and a quarter point reduction in Fed funds. However, the economic sta- tistics surrounding its action were sufficiently gloomy for the more pessimistic Wall Street analysts to wonder whether it might have to trim rates once more before the cost-of-money cycle turns upwards again. The Fed's eas- ing took the discount rate from 5.5 per cent to 5 - the lowest level since 1973. This rate - at which the Fed lends from its discount window to banks - has a largely symbolic impor- tance, sending a signal of the Fed's intentions to the market. The discount rate had to be lowered as part of any easing package because it tradition- ally stands beneath the key Fed funds rate, the benchmark for short-term rates, and, until Friday, Fed funds too had been at 5.5 per cent. These cuts in turn triggered a half point cut by the banks in the prime lending rate, which at 8 per cent is at its lowest level since 1987. The cut in the prime will have a knock-on effect on a wide range of con- sumer and commercial loans. The Fed said it had taken its action \"in light of the weak- ness in the money and credit aggregates, the improving inflation environment and con- cerns about the ongoing strength of the economic expansion\".

The danger to the economy is that the burst of industrial expansion seen over the summer, which was due in some measure to an inventory rebuild, will not be sustainable without a recovery in consumer spending. Friday brought some gloomy figures on this front. Retail sales dropped 0.7 percentage points in August, the largest drop since January, when the nation was glued to its televi sion sets for the Gulf war. The fall was about twice as large as anticipated. It was concentrated in the automotive and housing related sectors, but also spread into general goods and clothing. Vehicle sales figures also released on Friday showed no sign of a pick-up in confidence during the early part of Sep- tember. Figures for the first 10 days of the month showed car sales down 23 per cent from the same period of 1990, and selling on a seasonally-ad justed basis of 5.4m units a year, compared with 7.lm. Perhaps most disturbing, however, has been the recent performance of the money sup ply, to which the Fed has been playing close attention in recent months. M2, the Fed's main monetary target, dropped by a remarkable $9.7bn in the week ending September 2, leav ing it at the bottom of the cen tral bank's target range for monetary expansion. However, this may be less worrying than it appears. Many analysts attri- bute the drop to depositors shifting their funds to take advantage of more favourable returns in bonds and mutual funds. However, although reports of a bank-imposed credit crunch may be over-stated, consumers are worried about losing their jobs and the depression in the housing market, and are in no mood to extend their alreadcy substantial indebtedness. Friday's cuts may turn out to be the bottompof the interest -ate cycle, but the Fed may feel the need to trim another quar- ter point off Fed funds over the coming months. Its fears of sparking renewed inflation will have been calmed by the latest consumer price index, also released on Friday, which showed a modest 0.2 per centage point rise in August, slightly below the Wall Street consensus. All this would appear to be good news for the bond mar ket, so its reaction to Friday's news at first sight seemed per verse. Prices dropped and yields rose, with the Treasury's benchmark long bond ending the week with a yield of around 7.93, compared with 7.92 on Thursday night. That, however, appeared to be normal profit-taking, and during the week the long bond's yield shed 7 basis points. Despite the gloomy fig ures of the past few days, feel ing on Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook for the next 12 months although the caution is increasing and a vocal minor ity is extremely bearish. However, unless the econ- omy snaps back sharply over the next few months, the Fed may remain biased towards easing, or at least stay neutral in its monetary stance. That, coupled with good news on inflation, might yet bring the long bond down towards 7.75 per cent. Martin Dickson",

   "text_content" : "TIIE PROPOSED $60Qm loan to finance the North Sea developments of Agip (UK), part of the Italian state-controlled oil group, has been sub-underwritten and is expected to be launched for syndication next week, despite the earlier reservations expressed by some banks. Agip, like other Italian state-controlled entities, has faced a degree of resistance from financiers in the wake of the debacle surrounding Federconsorzi, the troubled Italian farm services co-operative. However, quality names are not turned down quickly during such quiet days in the syndicated loan business, and the Agip deal, first announced a month ago, has been sub-underwritten. Joining the four arrangers - Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada, Socidtd Gdndrale and Swiss Bank Corporation - are Banque Nationale de Paris, Bayerische Landesbank, NCNB National Bank, Rabobank, Union Bank of Switzerland and Westdeutsche Landesbank. The $600m limited recourse loan, to be used to finance Agip's share of the cost of developing the Tiffany and Toni oilfields, will begin at a margin of 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), rising to 42.5 after the beginning of 1994, and to 50 from 1997. The facility is structured in such a way that the loan, due to be repaid by the end of 1999, will at first be backed EUROMARKET TURNOVER ($m) Primaly Market Straights Con FRN Other US 954.5 0.0 173.0 15,906.5 Pmre 955.1 0.0 0.0 10,315.0 Other 728.6 0.0 302.5 9,182.8 Pm 2,430.3 0.0 157.3 784.7 seconir Market USS 16,675.7 711.7 6,272.1 11,391.4 Pmn 23,062.3 678.7 9,713.3 9,863.4 Other 29,224.7 906.7 3,005.5 59646.8 Pm 35,752.2 962.6 3,620. 54,423.2 Cedel Eurocder Total us$ 19,496.9 32,586.0 5204.9 Pm 21,377.4 33,211.2 54,588.6 Other 327122 70,285.4 102,997.6 Pm 38,42.3 65,288.8 104,131.2 Week to September 12, 1991 Source: ABD by a guarantee from Agip International, whose parent is the Italian state-controlled ENI group. In due course (expected to be two years after signing), the loan will convert to one with recourab only to the project itself. The interest margin will rise to between 82.5 basis points and 100 basis points, depending on the cashflow from the project. * Chelsea Building Society raised some eyebrows with its decision to offer a commitment fee of just 12.5 basis points more than Libor on its proposed 125m five-year revolving cash advance. The margin on the loan, when drawn, will be 30 basis points, and bankers were quick to point out that it was not enough to offer a commitment fee of less than half the lending margin. However, the Chelsea hopes to overcome the lenders' lack of enthusiasm with a promise to ensure that at least 60 per cent of the facility is drawn down at all times. The deal is brought by Schroder Wagg, which pointed out that the terms were roughly in line with similar recent building society transactions. * Philip Morris responded to leaks in the market last week to confirm that it was talking to its banks about refinancing credit facilities amounting to $12bn. At the same time, it wants to raise a further $3bn. However, several bankers discounted the suggestion that a deal was imminent. Talk about the financing first circulated two months ago, and the company has until March to carry it off. After that date, it would have to reclassify the existing $12bn as a short-term liability, rather than a long-term one. As expected, though, news of the company's plans caused a jittery moment or two for executives in companies which, like Cadbury Schweppes, are often talked of as possible Philip Morris takeover targets, and helped to push the share prices of some brand-rich companies marginally higher.

The rest can be poon-core orr i nU capital, comprising subordinated debt instruments, reserves and general Banks in different countries face specific problems In meeting the Basle targets. For example, Japanese banks can count 45 percent of unreal- ised pins in holdings of securities as Tier II captaL As the Tokyo stock market ha fallen, the bank' capital ratios have deteriorated, forcing them to curtail new lending and raise Tier II capital from elsewhere - mainly by issuing subordinated debt No-one is expecting a repeat of the unregulated flood of subordinated debt Issues by Japanese banks which hit the international bond market last autumn. The Japanese finance minis- try is keen to maintain an orderly flow of deals. However, further weakness of the Tokyo stock market next year could leave the banks with few alternatives. At the end of last September, two of the 22 largest Japanese financial insti- tutions had Tier II capital ratios suffi- cient to meet the final Basle targets. This year's interim results will be watched closely. In the US, the big banking mergers of the summer between Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, and Security Pacific and BankAmerica, were driven by the need for greater effi- ceancy. However, underlining the drive for efficiency are concerns about capital; Improved profitability is essential its banks are to attract capital in the long run. Improved margins allow income to be retained and capital gen- erated without recourse to the mar- kets. Cut dividends are a sign of the ugent need to retain income. Even so, capital-raising debt issues have proceeded all year, with $2.5bn common stock, $2bn preference shares and $3.5bn subordinated debt issued by US banks this year. This does not include the $lbn capital raised by Citi- corp from share placements with Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, a Saudi prince, and a group of US institutions. Europe can boast many of the world's best capitalised, most profit- able banks. But there are still plenty of European institutions eager to launch what bankers describe as \"opportunistic\" capital issues. Even banks which meet the Basle ratios now may not do so by January 1993 if they continue to expand lending. Hence banks such as National Westminster, which has a Tier I capi- tal ratio of more than 5 per cent, comfortably within the Basle target, bas made two ree share issues. Banco Santander, which has a Tier I ratio of close to 6 per cent, has also raised preference capital in the US this month. So the amount of fresh capital which has to be raised from all sources during the next year depends, among other things, on the rate at which banks expand lending. Every $100m in new corporate loans requires Pm more capital. It is arguable that the recession in the US and many European econo- mies has deferred the question for the time being. Despite fears of a credit crunch, demand for loans from banks has been relatively low. The slow- down in bank lending has been dra matic. 0 The big five Japanese city banks showed negative asset growth of nearly 4 per cent in the year to March, having shown growth of between 16 and 20 per cent for each of the previous four years. * The big eight US banks have shown average loan growth at or below 4 per cent every year since 1986. * The big four UK clearing banks shnowed average loan growth of just 1.25 per cent last year, against 16.3 per cent in 1989 and 20 per cent in 1989. None of these figures, supplied by IBCA, the credit rating agency, are adjusted for inflation. How much of the slowdown in lend- ing is attributable to recession and how much is attributable to banks unwillingness to lend remains unan- swered. The real test could come as the UK and other economies pull out of reces- sion. Will the banks be sufficiently capitalised to fund economic recovery and still stay within the Basle tar- gets? Will new sources of capital be available to them? The answer to both questions is probably \"yes, but at a price\". Throughout the worst fears of a credit crunch, the Basle group of cen- tral bank regulators remained ada- mant that their original capital ade- quacy targets would not be relaxed. The original ratios have not been changed, and new instruments designed by financial engineers have been ruled unacceptable. Ready sources of capital which satisfy both the regulators and investors are few. Most banks are now perceived as less profitable and of lower credit quality than a few years ago. As a result, the cost of capital has risen. If banks wish to maintain profitability, which is in turn essential to attract more capital, this increased cost will be passed through to borrowers.

   "text_content" : "Structural changes to, the economy since the downturn of the early 1980s have led to a more resilient industrial base that is now being tested by the recession. Yet Wales has attracted more than its share of investment projects in growth sectors, writes Anthony Moreton A RELATIVELY little-noticed paragraph in the papers in the middle of last month could be a signal of profound changes in the fortunes of Wales over the next decade. The item said that Matthew Epstein, a 43-year-old from New York, was to become the next director of the Welsh National Opera Company. Without disrespect to him, it is doubtful if, outside the con- fines of the world of music, Mr Epstein's is a name that com- mands immediate recognition. Not for him to jostle on the plinth alongside Beatle Paul McCartney or media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Within music, it is a differ- ent matter. Mr Epstein has been artistic consultant to the San Francisco Opera, the Chi- cago house and to Carnegie Hall; for nearly 20 years he has been with Columbia Artists Management. In the Big Apple he is a very big fish indeed - and he has just arrived in Wales. That a man of his stature at the height of his artistic pow- ers should have chosen to come to Wales reflects the standing the country has in the world of music. Unfortunately, that percep- tion of the principality as a place to be is not widely held outside that sphere. And that is one of the most important problems Wales now faces. Too many people in the rest of Britain, perhaps most of them, believe Wales is still a place where coal remains king and steel mills belch forth their dirty emissions as they did 30 years ago, let alone 100. Mr David Waterstone, a Scot who spent seven years in Car diff as chief executive of the 'elsh Development Agency; used to say that the greatest problem facing Wales today was changing its image. The arrival of Matthew Epstein will contribute just a little towards that. Outside the arts, Wales has left the era of heavy industry behind it. Coal has all but dis- appeared, with only four pits left at the end of this year; steel remains a potent force but in a much more modern, less labour-intensive form; cop- per, lead, zinc and other metal forming industries have gone completely. In their place have come financial services, elec- tronics, food processing, phar- maceuticals and merchant banking. High stack has beer replaced by high tech. The message of the changing nwrrcn ct ~Ammnr~a m~mra~onu~r cÂ·n rlworno~ hs b-n fnpMctt by hlig Mch! face of Waies will be thrust home to an international audi- ence this autumn when Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, travels to Japan and the Pacific Basin with Professor Eric Ash, rector of London Uni- versity's Imperial College of Science and Technology, to launch Imperial Park, a joint venture between the two organisations to set up a sci- ence park at Newport. The science park is part of a giant Â£250m development, Celtic Lakes, being undertaken by building group Trencher- wood Commercial and a local concern, Bassaleg, to create the largest business park on the western side of Britain. The 170-acre development, on land originally earmarked for Toyota's motor plant and larger than Bristol's Aztec West, is expected to lead to the creation of 8,000 jobs by the turn of the century. This devel- opment is seen as a suitable gateway to the new Wales. Dr Jones sees collaboration between the WDA and Imperial College as setting the ground- work for the emergence of a Silicon Valley in Britain. \"America's great lead in this area came through universi- ties, industry and the commu- nity acting together,\" he says. \"We want to do the same thing in Wales and our association with Imperial College, one of the world's leading science institutions, gives us that opportunity. \"Foreigners have fewer hang-ups than Britons in com- ing to Wales. They do not see it as a dark, nasty place but as somewhere with its own cul- ture and identity.\" In cultural terms, too, Wales is changing. Welsh culture has always been stronger than in any other part of the UK because of the strength of the Welsh language. About 18 per cent of the people still speak it and in many parts it is impos- sible not to hear it. The Welsh Language Board, set up to establish a future framework for the language, has presented proposals for a new language bill which would put Welsh on an equal footing administra- tively with English. Mr John Elfed Jones, the board's chairman, who is also chairman of the controversial Welsh Water, says that the pre- vious Act in 1967 did not give equal validity to the two lan- guages but that the time has come for a change. \"The people of Wales still cannot live, can- not marry, cannot die in Welsh,\" he says. \"We want equal validity and status for Welsh. \"Legislative and executive obstacles to its use should be ended. Provision for a greater use of the language in the pub- lic sector is necessary and a statutory body should be set up to care for its interests.\" With the exception of the CBI, which says it would add to costs, the Jones doctrine has considerable force within Wales and it would appear the government is not unsympath- etic towards its general thrust. But elsewhere, traditions emain unchanged. Politically, Wales remains a bastion for the Labour party. Three of the party's six leaders since 1945 have represented Welsh constituencies. With a general election approaching, it is unlikely that Labour's enormous strength in the coun- try will be eroded. The attempt by the Conser- vatives to confine Labour to its heartlands in the industrial valleys seems to have failed. Riding the crest of early Thatcherism, the Tories cap- tured a third of the principal- ity's 38 seats in 1983; since then, it has been downhill at an accelerating pace and there is little time to stage a recov- ery. Labour has the young MPs of cabinet material; it has the more efficient organisation. That will take some overturn- Mr Peter Walker, the previ- ous Welsh secretary, used to talk about bringing unemploy- ment levels in the depressed valleys of south Wales down to those in the south-east of England when he launched an initiative to rejuvenate the area three years ago. His pump-priming and per- sonal involvement achieved a lot and the quality of life undoubtedly continues to improve. In regional terms, though, as Mr Dennis Thomas, of Univer- sity College of Wales, Aberys- twyth, points out, Wales is bot- tom of the pile in many areas and has actually been going backwards rather than for- wards. More men earn under Â£130 a week than in any other part of Britain; gross domestic product per head is lower than elsewhere as is personal income and personal dispos- able income per head. Whereas men earned 95.7 per cent of the British average in 1980, the figure had dropped to 87.5 per cent a decade later. Among women the drop was not quite so severe, perhaps reflecting the way in which it has become easier for a woman to find work, with so much of it in the 1990s becoming part-time. Another academic, Dr Kevin Morgan of University College, Cardiff, believes that Wales could learn from the more advanced regions of Europe, especially Baden-Wirttemberg, the German Land (or province) whose capital, Stuttgart, is twinned with Cardiff. It is important with the European open market fast approaching that policy-makers in Wales \"recognise that new geo-politi- cal alliances are being estab- lished in Europe below the level of nation-states.\" Wales is not ignoring these moves. It has forged close links with Baden-Wiirttemberg as well as with Catalonia in Spain, Rhone-Alpes in France and Livorno in Italy. Perhaps those links are, imperceptibly, paying dividends. This year's Cardiff Festival of Music, which opened on Sat- urday night has a Czech theme. Internationalism is in the air. New York's Matthew Epstein should feel quite at home."

In fact, in the last year alone 147 inward investment projects have been announced involving new investment totalling Â£585 million. Bosch, Panasonic and Hitachi are just three of the many leading international manufacturing companies now based in Wales. Wales' impressive communications links-motorways, ports and the Cardiff/Wales airport-make it an ideal manufacturing centre for the whole European market. BA has chosen Cardiff/Wales airport for its new Â£100 million engineering and servicing centre. But it's not just good communications that attract companies to Wales. It's advantageous in so many ways. Wales offers a skilled, productive and adaptable workforce. And many excellent sites, available for manufacturing and offices.

   "text_content" : "The economic recession is difere om a 80s, writes Anthon Moreton JUST AS most people were thinking about their summer holidays at the start of last month, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh Secretary, pulled a big investment rabbit out of his hat. Trico, one of the world's leaders in the manufacture of windscreen wipers for cars and lorries, was to close its factory in West London and move to a site at Pontypool in Gwent, creating another 540 jobs in Wales. Mr Hunt has been regularly dipping his hand into the hat and bringing out goodies this year. On a single day in July he unveiled 14 industrial pro jects involving an investment of Â£33m. They ranged from Fibrax investing Elm at Wrexham to expand its rubber- moulding plant, creating 33 jobs, to Peer investing Â£0.7m in setting up an office furniture factory at Blaenavon, creating 48 jobs. \"Wonderful news,\" he called the package which a cynic might have observed came just before official statistics showed unemploy- WEEKLY EARNINGS* (C) WALES aU Wales UK % of UK MALES: manual 1980 111.3 111.7 99.6 1984 148.9 152.7 97.5 1989 209.8 217.8 96.3 1990 224.7 237.2 94.7 MALES: non-manual 1980 132.5 141.3 93.8 1984 192.1 209.0 91.9 1989 280.9 323.6 86.8 1990 306.2 354.9 86.3 MALES: all 1980 119.1 124.5 95.7 1984 165.8 178.8 92.7 1989 238.6 269.5 88.5 1990 258.6 295.6 87.5 FEMALES: manual 1980 67.7 68.0 99.6 1984 94.0 93.5 100.5 1989 131.8 134.9 97.7 1990 143.5 148.0 97.0 FEMALES: non-manual 1980 78.5 82.7 94.9 1984 116.7 124.3 93.9 1989 180.5 195.0 92.6 1990 193.0 215.5 89.6 FEMALES: all 1980 75.4 78.8 95.7 1984 111.1 117.2 94.8 1989 168.0 182.3 92.2 1990 180.3 201.5 89.5 Average gross earnings for ulMlne employees on adult rase In April Source: New Earnings Survey 1990: Welsh Economic Trends . ~ II .. . .1 ... .. .... 1 ment going up again to a seasonally adjusted 9.1 percent as vacancies notified to Job- centres fell. Not all the redundancies which have led to the rise in unemployment are recession- related. The decision of Thorn Electric to shut its Merthyr Tydfil plant, where it has over 500 workers, arose through changes in the lighting indus- try rather than a drop in con- sumer demand, and Hoover's laying off of more than 400, also in Merthyr, was an attempt by management.to win back control of its functions against a militant engineering union. The seeming paradox of Wales is that it continues to attract newcomers in encour- aging numbers at the same time that it lays off workers in even larger numbers. There is no doubt that the recession, which reached Wales about a year ago, rather later than in the rest of the UK, is still affecting the economy. It is a different recession, though, from that at the start of the 1980s. That was a structural upheaval; this time, it is con- sumer dominated. \"Ten years ago the narrowly- based Welsh economy wa bit more severely than elsewhere in Britain as the traditional industries collapsed, says Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the Welsh Development Agency. \"This time a broader-based economy is more resilient and Wales is coming through the downturn better than many other UK regions.\" Mr Dennis Thomas, lecturer in economics at the University College of Wales in Aberys- twyth, believes evidence of resilience has to be treated with caution. \"Some parts of the country have done extremely well, based on the inflow of investment, espe- cially around Cardiff in the south-east and Wrexham in the north-east. But large areas of Wales have still to benefit and prosperity has been unevenly distributed. \"Some forecasters who were optimistic about Welsh pros- pects in the 1990s have begun to have doubts. Their view that Wales would emerge better placed than in the mid-1980s, and also better placed than other regions of Britain, are beginning to be questioned. The recession has bitten deeper than expected.\" Such caution is sensible as only the most tentative signs exist that the economy is pulling out of the recession. The latest CBI quarterly industrial trends survey for Wales, published at the end of July, warned that recent interest rate cuts had \"not yet brought the boost in optimism that companies need to ensure a sustained economic recovery\". It went on to add that the report was the 10th successive quarterly survey to show a weakening of business confi- dence. Its one note of optimism was that \"the decline has slowed since its worst point at the start of the year\". The government's index of industrial production and con- struction in Wales indicatse much the same state of affairs. First quarter 1991 figures, the latest available, showed a fur- uwyn Jone: \"Wi- t ioSni tiIihi i hroug uiifthMlMI many dler UK nrgIno UK 6SS WHAKLY EARIMU Manual Non.Manual All Manual Non-Manual All Malu Maim Mala Females Females Fmnales South-East Â£255.3 Â£404.0 Â£344.4 Â£164.9 Â£244.6 Â£232.5 ast Anglia Â£237.2 Â£333.9 E281.1 Â£141.9 Â£198.3 Â£185.6 South-West E227.0 Â£326.6 E277.3 Â£141.8 Â£199.5 Â£186.2 West Midlands Â£229.4 Â£322.3 Â£269.3 Â£143.1 Â£195.0 Â£181.1 East Midlands Â£231.6 Â£322.8 Â£269.7 Â£140.1 Â£198.9 Â£181.6 Yorks & Humberside Â£230.7 E316.8 Â£266.9 Â£140.8 Â£193.5 Â£181.2 North-West Â£233.1 Â£322.6 Â£274.7 Â£143.8 Â£199.8 Â£186.9 North Â£231.6 Â£314.5 Â£265.2 Â£141.0 Â£192.5 Â£180.2 Scotland Â£231.7 Â£327.4 Â£276.4 Â£141.2 Â£200.6 Â£187.2 Wales Â£224.7 Â£306.2 Â£258.6 Â£143.5 Â£193.0 Â£180.3 UK Â£237.2 Â£354.9 Â£295.6 Â£148.0 Â£215.5 Â£201.5 Full-Ume e*mployess on adult rates, April M Source: New Earnings Survey, 1990 ther fall compared with the last three months of 1990. The fall was almost imperceptible - 0.1 per cent - raising hopes that the downturn may be bot- toming out. The air of general pessimism was also reflected by Dr David Phillips, director of the Cardiff Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who reported that \"trade in both the service and manufacturing sectors in Wales has become even more difficult for most companies. Small firms have been most affected, showing a sharper decline than companies employing over 200 workers.\" If Wales is about to come out of recession, as Mr Stuart Lindi say, a partner in the Cardiff office of Touche Ross, believes: there are still dangerous times ahead. \"Wales has changed its nature considerably in the past decade,\" he says, \"and encour- aged the growth of self-employ- ment and small firms. \"For these people the end of recession and the start of the upturn can be a dangerous time. Small businesses tend to see light at the end of the tunnel, put in a burst of expansion and find they are doing too much for the climate of the time. They have got in front of their financial abilities and can have an extremely difficult time negotiating this period.\" Although Wales had one of the fastest growing regional economies in the second half of the 1980s, it still has inherent weaknesses. Mr Thomas points out that growth has not been translated into greatly increased prosperity and the economy is characterised by a low level of activity. \"Wales has fallen well behind the British average on earnings over the last decade,\" he says, \"and the fall in unemployment has not been as great as in many other regions.\" There continues to be regional unemployment black- spots, he says, especially in some of the valleys of South Wales and the smaller towns of mid and north Wales; agricul- ture is depressed; there is a relatively low proportion of the workforce in the higher pay- ment sectors such as financial services and information tech- nology; and the private sector is still investing inadequately. All this will have to change before it can really be said that Wales is out of the woods.

   "text_content" : "IN. , 10ays' time Wales meets -. Cj~ieCty (Londonwhen Mr Ei'DidH t, Welsh Secretary, cser House at which he jirll extol the virtues of the ripalit, andin particular st , as a financial It is a measure of the way in which South Wales has become a home for financial services companies that this dinner shoulidhave become an annual levent. Ten years ago it would have been laughable to have bracketed Cardiff and the City in the same breath; today, Wales has a flourishing sinan- cial industry. It still has a long way to go before it can claim to be a lead- ing financial centre. But it has made important steps along the path. Mr Peter Walker, Mr Hunt's predecessor, used to like to point out that the sinan- cial services sector employed two or three times as many people as coal and steel com- bined. Today, that statement raises no eyebrows. A financial services initia- tive, launched by the Welsh Development Agency with the backing of the government three years ago, has played an important part in the growth of the sector. This has seen a small financial industry that contained names such as the Bank of Wales, a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland, Princi- pality Building Society and Chemical Bank expand in all directions. Next Friday six days before the Lancaster House dinner, the Principality, a medium- sized society, 24th in the build- ing societies league, is to host a dinner in Cardiff's city hall to mark the attainment of a Â£lbn assets base. In the next few weeks the society will move into a new purpose-built headquarters in the city. Six weeks ago, at the end of July, Venture Link Investors, a Maidenhead-based concern, launched a f3m venture fund aimed at equity funding for unquoted companies and prod- uct development finance. A few days earlier NCM, the Dutch insurance company, had completed the takeover of the Export Credits Guarantee Department offshoot in Cardiff. New names abound. Axa, the French insurance company, Aegon Life, a Dutch life assur- ance concern, and Das, a Ger- man insurance concern have all joined the community recently. For Aegon, the Car- diff office is only its second in the UK outside central London. CbsudnI 31 In kiCwum ur merg~r cor Axa has chosen Cardiff as the centre for its UK general-insur- ance operations. It bought Westgate Insurance, a local company, a decade ago, changed the name to Axa last year, and used it as a vehicle to develop general insurance in Britain and has seen its pre mium income rise to around E80m, of which motor business, the company's largest, accounts for half. The move to Cardiff has been so successful that Axa has built up a staff of some 250 in the Welsh capital and is now looking for bigger premises within the city. Nor is Axa alone. Willis Wrightson Wales - part of Willis Corroon, one of the world's big four insur- ance-to-financial services groups - has seen its business rise to the point where it has nad to move into larger offices within Cardiff and Chartered Trust, a wholly-owned subsid- iary of Standard Chartered, has set up a new computer cen- tre to serve not just itself but also its parent bank. Since Mr Walker launched the financial services initia tive, other names that have arrived include N.M. Roths child, National Provident Insti tution, D.C. Gardner and BNP Mortgages. Earlier arrivals include TSB Trust, which established it- general insurance division in Newport in 1987, and the AA which set up one of its three main Insurance booking cen- tres in Cardiff in 1977. Nor is this the end of the story. Oth- ers are in the pipeline. Credit Lyonnais is looking at the options of opening an office in Cardiff, possibly next year, and tie Prude t al is thought liRely to choose the city as one of its main centres in a shake-up of its own regional operations. Most of the newcomers have, not altogether surprisingly, chosen Cardiff but there have been new arrivals across the whole of south Wales, from Newport in the east to Swan- sea in the west. They have been attracted by reasonable office rents, a good supply of office buildings, available labour and lower wage rates than in many other parts of Britain. Many of these compa- nies have come to south Wales because they want to escape pressures such as high labour turnover and escalating prop- erty costs which are an inevita- ble concomitant to operating in the home counties. But now things are changing as the recession bites. Many of those pressures remain but as ihe shake-out in the financial sector in London and the south-east of England gathers pace, the comparative attra-- tions of South Wales begin to recede. There is some evidence that the flow of business to Wales is beginning to slow. Not only is the south-east now a stronger competitor. Bristol, just across the Severn Bridge, is also emerging as a viable alternative for a com- pany relocating out of the south-east. Bristol has sud- denly found itself with surplus office space and labour and as a\"tily with- a strong financial tradition it must now become a serious competitor to Soutn Wales for any company looking to relocate. The merger in the US between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Harover Trust also poses a question-mark. Chemical Bank has built a highly-successful back-office operation processing accounts and data functions since it arrived in Cardiff in 1983. The merger means that all the com- panies' worldwide operations will be under review and there is a possibility, albeit slight, that the Cardiff business could be affected. Mr Phil Morgan, director of the financial services initia- tive, believes the changes tak- ing place in world banking offer opportunities as well as threats. \"The move to increas- ing size by the European sinan- cial organisations and the desire of American and Japa- nese banks to set up in Europe before the end of next year offers considerable scope for South Wales. \"These banks and insurance companies may still want their head offices to be in London but they will be looking else- where for their support operations. South Wales is excellently situated to win the back-office support work that these concerns will want,\" he says. All the majors in almost every field are now in Wales, NMr Morgan adds. \"The impor- tance of that is that in almost every sector today it is impos- sible for the small concern to give the depth and range or acilities necessary for invest- ment and other decisions. -\"With all te big named resi- dent in Wales the country is in a strong position to do every- thing that a company can want. That is a very big step forward for the economy.\" Anthony Moreton",

   "text_content" : "\"WE DON'T se Wales just on questions of price,\" says Mr Philip Head, the new chief executive of the Welsh Devel- opment Agency. By this he means that com- aes are not being drawn to Wales solely because of the help on offer. : But although the compara- tive cheapness of setting up in Wales may not be everything, ft certainly helps if a compaiy e can keep Its costs low what is, in effect, a Parts of Wales are develop- ment areas and others have intermediate status. This means they qualify for govern- ment help. Nowadays, this means regional selective assis- tance. As the name implies, that is more discriminatory than the old regional grants. But the help can still be sub- stantial. One agency worked out that for its area (not Wales), selective assistance could amount to 30 per cent of a start-up cost. South Wales and other parts were also coal and steel areas. Help. is available from the European Coal and Steel and Coal Community Fund. Some areas of Wales are designated Objective 2 under the Euro- pean Regional Development Fund, and thus qualify for infrastructural assistance. There can also be help for training from the European Social Fund. Last, but by no means least, there is the WDA itself It is split into several divi- sions. Welsh Development International is the inward investment arm of the WDA. It had a record year in 1990-91, attracting 147 projects which should generate Â£585m of capi- tal investment. Other sections are involved in rural development, land rec- lamation, investment manage- ment and business services. Most significant of all, for pur- poses of attracting new compa- nies and helping others expand, there are wide prop- erty activities. The WDA manages a portfo- lio of around 18m sq ft of industrial and commercial property. In the 1990-91 accounts this was valued at nearly Â£300m. As with government assis- tance, the nature of the WDA's factory and office building is changing. There is a greater drive to involve the private sector. Welsh Property Venture (WPV) was established in 1989 to promote joint venture oppor- tunities between the agency and private developers. In its first full year it exceeded its target of 500,000 sq I Philip Hee: \"We onl MI ism on prwo- ft of building starts and 400,000 sq ft of building completions. The leverage ratio was 1:4.3, i.e. Â£1 of public sector money for every Â£4.30 of private money. The WDA still has its own direct build programme and in 1990-91 it completed 1.2m sq ft of industrial and commercial floorspace, both commercial and bespoke. The agency makes money from its property activities. Of its total funds of Â£153m in 1990-91, around Â£85m came from the government. Much of the rest was from property, through rents or disposals. But the fact that the WDA can offer cheap factories either for sale or rent, as well make investments, represents another set of incentives for companies. The average rent per sq ft on property let by the WDA during the year was Â£3.10, which is cheap compared with other parts of the UK. What Mr Head means by say- ing price is not the only deter- minant is that, even with sub- sidy and assistance, if other conditions are not right, com- panies will not be attracted. \"Toyota, one of the biggest manufacturing investments in Britain in recent years, chose Derbyshire. Wales only got the engine plant. Honda went to Swindon. Neither of these is an assisted area,\" Mr Head says. He feels that assistance is important at the margin in choosing between one place or another. What matters is the total package on offer. Many of the old industrial areas are assisted but they also usually have a pool of skilled labour. Wales has traditionally been a low wage economy com- pared with other parts or Britain. Now that the work- force is not so heavily union- ised, industrial relations are better and the labour force is well-suited for incoming manu facturing concerns. Single union deals and shift working are increasingly the norm. Cheap, skilled and compliant labour is probably uas bnpa- taut as grant aid in pulling in comipanies. But there ae other factors. Even without assis- ince, Ireenfld sites are sheap. With the 14 running beyond Cardiff, communica- uone with London and Heath- ruw airport outside London are Equally important is that Wales can be sold as a separate country. Foreign investors can be persuaded of its distinct cul- tural and national identity: it is more than just a region of Britain. With its own secretary of state and the Welsh Offce the administrative circuits are shorter in Wales, as they are in Scotland compared with say, the north-west and north-east. Arguably the most impor- tant draw of all is that an organisation like the WDA exists. The WDA pulls together the various attractions. It points out what is on offer. Above all, the WDA actively promotes and sells Wales. It has representatives in the US, Japan and Germany, and is about to open an office in Brus- sels. Inward investment has become a very competitive business with not only Scot- land and Ireland, but many European countries, such as Denmark and Portugal, setting out their stalls to attract grants. The WDA was established in 1976. In its early days it felt overshadowed by its Scottish equivalent and the Irish devel- opment agency which had been in business longer and could offer extremely attractive pack ages in terms of grants, train ing aids and tax concessions. At first the Welsh Develop- ment Agency tried to capture anything that moved. It wanted to create jobs - any iobs. Slowly they began to attract prestige projects, and persuade indigenous busi- nesses to grow. Mr Head says: \"We are still interested in volume, but we want to target specific sectors more closely so that we can get added value and improve wage levels.\" He is thinking in terms of high technology companies, health care, automotive prod acts and companies with an element of scientific research. Apart from the foreign com- petition, the recession has made life more difficult. \"We seeing fewer inquiries, but of those inquiries more compa- nies follow through to comple- tion. More companies are seri- ous,\" he says. Stewart Dalby",

   "text_content" : "FRIDAY, aay 17 is a,day that the government would prefer to forget Iii the eariy 'hours, the Tories learnt that they had lost Monmouth, their second safest parliamentary seat in Wales. As the returning officer intoned the news in Abergav- enny's leisure centre that Sir John Stradling Thomas's 9,350 majority had been'turned at the by-election into a Labour majority of 2,406, Mr Roger Evans, the Conservative candi- date, his agent and his support- ers listened glumly. By chance, that Friday was the start of the Labour party's annual Welsh conference and hours later Mr Huw Edwards, the victor, was being cheered by Mr Neil Kin- nock, his party leader, and sev- eral hundred delegates in Llan- dudno. A disappointed Mr David Hunt, the Welsh Secretary, was having to come to terms with the fact that a wheel had fallen off the drive to make the Con- servative party a viable force in Wales. The result was not the worst by-election reverse the Conservatives had suffered during the present parliament; two months earlier Ribble Val- ley had fallen to the Liberal Democrats with a 22.4 per cent swing and in October last year the swing at Eastbourne, again to the Liberals, had been 19 per cent. Put in that context, the swing to Labour at Monmouth, at 13.5 per cent, could be seen as almost a \"success\" in dam- age limitation terms. But it fol- lowed the loss in Wales of the Vale of Glamorgan seat two \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Labour oadersr f .rom WM ai James Callaghii, Midi-I Fool nd Nell Kinnock years earlier. Almost a decade ago, the Conservative party believed it was capable of breaking the stranglehold that the Labour party held on Wales. At the 1983 general election the Tories gained four constituencies and ended up with 14 of the princi- pality's 38 seats. Labour was, if not reeling, definitely hanging on outside its industrial base in the South Wales valleys, where they traditionally weigh rather than count majorities that top 30,000. Although there was a set- back for the Tories in 1987, Mr Peter Walker, the incoming Secretary of State, was deter- mined to show that his vision of caring Conservatism could convince the people of Wales there was a healthy alternative to the grip exercised by Labour in so many places. If the Conservatives are to avoid being marginalised, as they have been in Scotland, Mr Hunt has a mountain to climb. Safely ensconced with a major- ity of almost 13,000 in the Wir- ral, which butts onto norti Wales, he now oversees a des erate fight even to hold thi party's remaining six seats Three of these are real margin alr, the \"safest\" cushioned by a majority of 3,024. Only one oi the others has a majority thai runs into five figures. In such a situation, MPs brush up thei. CVs and put their faith in the weather, the economy, Tarol cards - almost anything except the electorate. Mr Hunt's task has not beer eased as Labour has sharpened its act in the past half a dozer years. It has a group of young, able MPs such as Mr Alan Michael and Mr Rhodri Morgan from Cardiff, Newport West's Mr Paul Flynn, Torfaen's MP Paul Murphy and Caerphilly's Mr Ron Davies, several oi whom are seen as ministerial talent. It has also improved ii the constituencies. Winnable seats have been targeted and all the aids of the modem comr puterised society employed - something more usually associ. ated with the Tories. Labour, happy to be able to. \"ignore\" a dozen of its own seats safe in the knowledge that a cataclysmic upset would be needed to suffer defeat, goes into the election aiming to win more. While the Tories have been battered, their cause is not completely lost. Curiously, they could win seats even if there were a strong swing against them. Wales has a number of constituencies where the votes are spread fairly thinly among four candi- dates. Strategic voting could throw up unexpected results. This happened in 1987 in Ynys Mon, where Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists, captured a seat from the Conservatives that had once been Labour. The Tories could regain this seat with a little luck as they could Brecon and Radnor, real finger- nail country, which Mr Rich- ard Livsey won in a by-election for the Liberal Democrats from the Conservatives in 1985 (it had been Labour in the 1970s) and nnrw hnlrA hv hiut 5 vntes Plaid Cymru appears to be firmly established in its other two seats in North Wales at Caernarfon and Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and the Liberals' other MP, the highly-popular Mr Geraint Howells, seems equally assured of gracing the Commons benches once more from his Ceredigion and Pem- broke North base. At the second tier of govern- ment Mr Hunt has started the process of the reorganisation of local authorities that is being undertaken contemporane- ously in England and Scotland. He has proposed a major shake-up in which the eight counties and the 37 district councils disappear and a single tier of all-purpose councils is introduced in about 20 areas. It is an irony that will not go unnoticed on him that this course largely undoes what his predecessor introduced in 1974. Then Mr Walker, who was at the time environment secre- tary in the Heath government, introduced an enormous reor- ganisation of local government that was aimed at undermining Labour's stranglehold on the large cities and industrialised counties of Britain. That reorganisation has been overturned. The Greater Lon- don Council has been abol- ished as have the English met- ropolitan counties such as West Yorkshire and the West Midlands. All that remains are the unloved counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland and a lot of smaller councils with names to which no one can put a geographic face. In Wales the main effect of the reorganisation was to reduce the counties from 13 to eight. Now Mr Hunt suggests they, too, should disappear although some of the county names, such as Montgomery- shire, will reappear - this time as unitary authorities. Mr Hunt has firmly set himself against the introduction of an elected Welsh assembly. Not everyone in his own party agrees on that, and others are broadly in favour of an assem- bly. As he knows, the Welsh Secretary can expect consider- able flak on this subject.",

The Japanese company has been manufacturing colour televisions at Bridgend in South Wales for 18 years. It will now move its colour television production from Bridgend industrial estate to the greenfield site at nearby Pencoed. This will release space on the existing site to expand its cathode ray tube manufacturing operation. The new factory will include production facilities for colour televisions and computer dis- play monitors, a research and development centre and a mul- ti-purpose sports facility. It will eventually provide 1,400 jobs, a mix of both skilled and semi-skilled. Training will be provided. The Welsh Development Agency has thus continued to make big catches in the com- petitive business of attracting investments. Last year British Airways decided to build a new mainte- nance base for its aircraft at Cardiff-Wales Airport. That should lead to 1,200 jobs and involve a capital investment of Â£100m. Earlier, Toyota said it would build a Â£140m engine plant on Deeside in North Wales, while Bosch announced plans for an alternators factory outside Car- diff at a cost of Â£120m. In all, there are now 330 for- eign manufacturing concerns in Wales. There are 41 from Japan, and these usually attract a lot of publicity. It is claimed that this is the biggest cluster of Japanese companies in Britain, more than the 20 concerns in Telford and the 34 in Milton Keynes. However, Wales has also pulled in 150 companies from Europe and 140 from North America. The large incoming foreign concerns are the ones which create news but they are not the whole picture. Around half the investment is from British or indigenous companies or from expansions by already established foreign companies such as Sony. The WDA, in its annual report for 1990-1991, claims it had a record year attracting 147 projects, involving Â£585m of capital investment. This could pave the way to 15,000 jobs. Since the WDA was set up in 1976, nearly Â£2.3bn has been committed or invested and more than 60,000 jobs have been created or safeguarded.

Like other old industrial areas, Wales had a pattern of dependence on a few big employers. Twenty years ago, steel, coal and related engi- neering and transport indus- tries accounted for a third of all manufacturing jobs. The recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s hit Wales particularly hard. The steel industry is much reduced and coal mining has virtually dis- appeared. There are just 2,000 jobs left in coal. This time the downturn in the economy has had a greater effect on white-collar compa- nies. The early 1980s recession hit manufacturing concerns. Wales has attracted some service industries. TSB general insurance and Bisley Office Equipment both set up operations in Newport. National Provident Institution went to Cardiff. Lloyds Bank moved some activities to Swan- sea. Despite a financial services initiative by Mr Peter Walker when he was Welsh Secretary, the principality's industries remain predominantly in man ufacturing. According to the WDA, around 80 per cent of new investments are in manu- facturing companies. But it is a different kind of manufacturing economy. It is more diversified, has less reli- ance on a few large employers and has a greater proportion of science-based or high technol ogy concerns. Recession has caught up with Wales, if a bit later than in the south-east. Unemploy- mnenit is 8.8 per cent overall, compared with a national aver age of 8.1 per cent and 6.9 per cent for the south-east. Statistics in the local news- papers indicate that about two thirds of manufacturing com- panies are not working at capacity. Business failures and bankruptcies are growing, and there is a lot of empty office property, at least in Cardiff. The WDA admits that the cli- mate has become harsher, with fewer inquiries. Gaining investment is harder work. Yet it seems unlikely that Wales will be hit as hard this time as it was in the last reces- sion. But the economic down- turn does raise the question of whether companies which have established themselves in Wales will disappear in adverse conditions. Everyone connected with promotion of the local economy has in mind the 1960s and 1970s when the governments of the day tried to encourage companies to go to the regions using incentives and subsidies. Often, these branch factories of large national or interna- tional companies left the areas when the economic climate turned nasty or the assistance ran out. On the train from London to Cardiff, a businessman told me he was going to see the WDA about two plastics companies he represented. Only small, with turnovers of about Â£5m to Â£6m, they had been in Wales for about five years and were now thinking of moving because they faced difficulties and the incentives had dried up. One company was consider- ing a move to Warwickshire and the other to Kent. Neither of these places was an assisted area as such, but in both cases help was on offer. Mr Philip Head, chief execu- tive of the WDA, says that some small companies do try to get more help, while others go under or move away. But most of the investments are more durable than those in the 1960s and 1970s. Over 40 per cent of all pro- jects in 1990-91 were to expand existing companies. The Japanese, in particular, tend to be stayers according to Mr Head. Given the capital out- lay involved and the individual corporate cultures which the Japanese like to develop with their workforces, it is unlikely that they will decamp to Portu- gal or Belgium in a hurry. Mr Head feels that subsidies and assistance are not the only factors that draw companies to Wales. Indeed, they are often not even the main influences. Stewart Dalby",

W(. 1wUG. Ukafy dA Arkuiwe. Fifn &Wd food PENTREGWYN lies on the side of Epynt, a mountain range where the only noise besides that of sheep is of the wind in the trees. From the farm's front door there are stunning views across the valley and the Bran, its gentle stream, toward Brecon six miles away. But views do not buy vegeta- bles and the Joneses who farm Pentregwyn - Bryan and his wife Fiona - are at the sharp end of the problems that face everyone in the Welsh farming community, especially in the upland areas of mid-Wales. Bryan Jones, together with his father Roy and brother Owen on next-door Gwar- thilan, have worked the area efficiently for years. As with most farmers every- where, farming is more than a livelihood: it is a living, a way of life. Now, like others throughout mid-Wales, they are having to come to terms with changes in agriculture forced on them by the need to control the colossus which the EC's common agricultural pol- icy has become. Ten years ago they were pre- dominantly sheep farmers; today their 211 acres are home to 45 cattle and 450 sheep. \"There is great uncertainty about the future,\" Bryan Jones says. \"Costs are rising, prices falling and all the farmers around here are under pres- sure.\" A report this summer on future agricultural prospects in mid-Wales showed how farm- ing would have to change even further if it was to survive. Farming would become almost a part-time occupation, wrote David Bateman, professor of agricultural economics at Uni- versity College, Aberystwyth. Farmers would have to sup- plement their incomes by doing other things. Bryan Jones already knows the truth of this. He has become an agent for Osmond's, a producer of animal nutrition products. Professor Bateman's report pointed out that the rate of decline in agricultural incomes in the 1980s was \"significant\" despite the vital role the indus- try plays in the economy of mid-Wales. Prices of all the main products were lower towards the end of the decade than at the start - by some 10 per cent for cattle and milk and by 15-25 per cent for sheep products. This year, it is hard to give the wool away because of world oversupply. Output of cattle and milk has also declined in mid-Wales - by between 9 and 12 per cent - though the sheep farmers have fared better since the profitability of the sector in the early 1960s led to an expansion of some 29 per cent. But with interest rates rising sharply, other costs going up and gov- ernment support levels coming down, economic pressures on those earning a living from farming have increased and average incomes have fallen since people tend not to move out of the industry. But Prof Bateman believes, that this trend might be reversed in the years ahead as the farming community is age- ing so that its numbers will decline, leading to a rise in incomes. What worries Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the Development Board for Rural Wales, a quango set up to regenerate the economic life of the area, and himself a sheep and cattle farmer near Welsh- pool, is that the industry is becoming subsidy-dependent. \"Twice as much subsidy is being paid for sheep as the price we get for it. That cannot be a good thing.\" The develop- ment hnoard commissioned the Bateman report and has accepted that it must do some- thing to underpin the sector. So it is helping to build an abattoir in Llanidloes for sheep and lambs, entering into part- nership with the area's main Training and Enterprise Coun- cil to provide business advice, assisting an animal-feed com- pany to expand and increasing its grant to Food Promotion Wales, which co-ordinates the marketing of Welsh foodstuffs, from Â£15,000 to Â£100,000 a year over the next three years. In the background, still, are the proposed changes emana- ting from Mr Ray MacSharry, the European commissioner for agriculture. These are strongly opposed by Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister on behalf of Britain's farming industry, but Mr Davies and Prof Bateman believe that many of the changes could benefit mid-Wales. Significantly, the Farmers' Union of Wales, which is much closer to the small Welsh farmer than the National Farmers Union, which is domi- nated by the big English farm- ers, has played down criticism of the MacSharry plans. The essence of these is mod- ulation, which in the jargon of Eurospeak means discriminat- ing in favour of the small man. Mr MacSharry has produced proposals which would benefit farmers with up to 750 sheep or with milk quotas up to 200,000 litres a year. About half the Welsh farmers come within these brackets and if the quota figure were raised to 300,000 lit- res it would encompass virtu- ally every one of them. Mr Gummer is opposing these limits and while it is acknowledged he is doing so because the proposed policy is intended to help poorer farm- ing countries such as Portugal, Greece and Italy, the Mac- Sharry scheme could be of ben- efit to mid-Wales and much of the rest of the principality. The arguments in Brussels illustrate just how far the abil- ity of government, or govern- ment-appointed bodies such as the development board, to help with local issues is now severely circumscribed. A pol- icy that may be geared to southern Portugal or the north German plain now has to be accepted, willy-nilly, for Wales. Prof Bateman is not one to search for a crock of gold at the end of a rainbow. It is of no use to the Joneses or Davieses of mid-Wales since their land is unsuitable for such conversion. But they can hardly be blamed for thinking of how they will be able to make ends meet in 10 years' time. Anthony Morton",

Hostilities started - last December when Welsh Water bought a 10 per cent stake in Swalec when it went private. The shareholding has since been raised to 14.9 per cent. Mr Jones has said that this is not with a view to a full takeover. That would be diffi- cult because the government holds a five-year golden share in Swalec and its articles limit any shareholder to a maximum stake of 15 per cent. (It would difficult but not impossible. The 15 per cent threshold could be removed if the Welsh Office and the Department of Trade could be persuaded that a merger of the two companies would create savings for customers and ben- efits to shareholders.) The reason for the share- holding is to concentrate the board of Swalec's mind on Mr Jones's belief that there could be savings from co-operation i'9Wrii ,6641 os repo t Jeibnwitit ttisthJU nvetures is culde ;ri ihtohe areas that' are sJis- engineering and maInIni i o tices, but s.

Yes, he'does want to build a strong indige- nous Welsh company which is capable of competing on a world stage. Far too many con- cerns in Wales, he believes, are satellites or branches of inter- national companies where con- trol over jobs and investment rests outside the country. Critics say the profits should be used to concentrate on core business and on clearing up the environment. Any profits after that should used to reduce prices to the benefit of the consumer. There is an implicit feeling that the WW company should not be using its resources to build a bigger monopoly than it already has, even though it would be a Wakfsh mrnnnnlr rthpr thaiin John Elfed Jones, across the Tass from Cardiff Arms Park an English one. In the year 1990-1991 Welsb Water made pre-tax profits o Â£128m on turnover of Â£29Mi This was a 32 per cent increase. The dividend was increased by 16.4 per cent. The reason for the good prof- its was that the company's debt was \"forgiven\" when it was privatised, and the com- pany was given a large amount of money as a \"green dowry\" at the time. Welsh Water man aged this dowry well and in 1990-91 it made Â£21m profits from the increase in interest rates over 1990-1991 alone. The company also started life as a private company with a generous \"J\" factor. That is the amount it is allowed to increase prices over the retail price index. WW was given a \"J\" factor of 6.5 per cent and this meant it could increase prices by around 15 per cent Mr Jones admits that WW is in practice a monopoly. \"That is why there is a regulator,\" he says. \"If the regulator finds we are charging too much for our services he can tell us to reduce prices. \"I get fed up with having to apologise for being successful.\" He denies that the core busi- ness is in any way ignored. \"Nothing is allowed to inter- fere with the safe management Of.Yp~core business.\" ti out that the com- Spa 25m on environ- nts over and a e t capital expenditure prame.

At :the same time, Mr Jones ha1s branched out into related bsisesses. He has bought five country house hotels. The logic here is that they are close to water or good walking and climbing territory. He wants them to develop along the lines of Scotland's fishing lodges. He points out that Welsh Water is the largest land owner in Wales with 93,000 acres. He has also set up a joint venture in environmental con- sultancy which operates in 20 countries and which is also involved in engineering design and maintenance. He is looking at the possibilities in waste disposal. Now, of course he has his eyes on South Wales Electric- ity. Swalec does not cover all of Wales, as Manweb operates in the north of the country. Swalec has around 2.1m cus- tomers compared to WW's 3m. A year ago, Swalec looked vulnerable. A loss of its supply business to utilities outside the country and' a poor perfor- mance from the retail sector resulted in a low return on capital employed. In 1990-91 pre-tax profits were 58.1m, an improvement of 81 per cent. The dividend rose by 6 per cent. Mr Jones, who had spent 15 years in the electricity busi- ness, was one of those who realised the effective monopoly on distribution was the key to profits irrespective of who was the end-supplier of electricity. Mr Wynford Evans, the chairman of Swalec and an erstwhile friend and fishing company of Mr Jones, admitted that prices for distribution had gone up but said in announc- ing the latest results last July: \"We contained our recent tariff increase within the limits set by our regulatory formula, and this increase was more than 5 per cent lower than Welsh Water's.\" Swalec was cutting costs by 4.5 per cent in real terms and working on moreefficiencies. With the company profitable and looking to become more so, there is little enthusiasm for a closer embrace from Welsh Water. Mr Evans said: \"My fellow directors and I are wholly opposed to any concept of a multi-utility grouping which would bring no material benefits and would be contrary to the interests of customers and shareholders.\" Yet Mr Jones genuinely believes there is an industrial logic to co-operation and seems prepared to go to great lengths to press his suit. This little war could run for a long time."

   "text_content" : "AT THE end of next month the Queen will open the Â£190m crossing that will take the A5 expressway under the Conwy in the shadow of one of Britain's greatest castles. The mile-long tunnel, techni- cally an immersed tube, is the first of its type to be built in Britain and the choice of a tun- nel rather than a bridge to cross the river was taken to minimise the environmental impact on Edward I's fortifica- tion which already has one of Telford's bridges alongside it. The A55 was described two years ago by Mr Peter Walker, then Secretary for Wales, in a magnificent piece of hype, as \"the road to opportunity\". With the Conwy crossing open, only one small section remains to be put in place before the dual carriageway links the English motorway system in the east and Bangor in the west. In the next few years the road will cross the Menai Strait and run on to Holyhead. The road has already had an effect in sucking investment westward. One company, Euro/ DPC, a subsidiary of Diagnos- tic Products Corporation of Los Angeles, chose Llanberis, in the shadow of Snowdon, this year as the site of its European headquarters for the produc- tion of medical diagnostic prod- ucts, creating 200 jobs in the first instance. One arrival does not signal an economic upturn, though, and the economic conse- quences of the road have still to be proved. The improvement in the North Wales economy which has undoubtedly taken place in the area centred on Wrexham has still to percolate west- wards. The eastern part of Clwyd, which butts onto England, has been a notable growth sector in the past few years with the arrival of some very big names, such as Toyota. Its engine plant complements those of long-time industrialists such as Pilkington. Even here the recession has COsL In rW urnauff neWm 0o 1 opwnwu W- wmUn IrT1 --r lwwu- Muiniy - Is the St David's Par, (above) at Deeside, on the busrineti pa \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t taken its toll. Mr Richard Ash- ton, the county's marketing manager, admits that the level of inquiries is not running as high now as a year ago. \"We have certainly seen a down- turn,\" he says. \"Companies are reluctant to commit them- selves in the present climate.\" Yet there are welcome signs. Hamilton Brothers, the oil and gas concern, is to build a gas- processing plant at Point of Ayr where it will bring ashore gas and oil from its \"signifi- cant\" find in block 110/13 in the Irish Sea north of Rhyl. \"This will be a important investment for the area,\" according to Mr Ashton, \"and will mean an infusion of new jobs, up to 500 during the con- struction phase and about 50 permanently when the station is operational and possibly as many as 150 indirectly.\" Mr Steve Morgan is watch- ing the economy closely. As chairman of Redrow, the larg- est privately-owned construc- tion company in Wales with a turnover of Â£110m a year, he has just completed the first phase of the Â£120m St David's business park that has already attracted Scottish Amicable, Bank of Wales, Barclays, Allied Dunbar and National Grid. He has also put up the four-star St David's Park hotel on the site. \"We have gone a stage fur- ther than just creating a busi- ness park,\" he says. \"We have just completed the only pur- pose-built day nursery in Wales there. This is a major attraction for any employer since he can offer jobs to mar- ried women who know their children will be both near them and safely looked after. \"Wales has come a long way in the last five years and, while margins in our business are tighter as a result of the reces- sion, there is great optimism that this part of the country will continue to expand. The upgrading of the A55 express- way has presented a number of development opportunities right along the coast. Now Clwyd is just 30 minutes from Manchester's international air- port and no part of north Wales is much more than an hour away, which gives us great competitive pull.\" The Welsh Development Agency is seeking to capitalise on the possibilities of revitali- sation offered by the comple- tion of the road by pumping more money into its urban pro- gramme. Major projects are to be undertaken at Holyhead, Rhyl, Caernarfon, Bangor and Conwy while feasibility appraisals are being under- taken over the next 12 months in Wrexham and Deeside. \"The main thrust of our activity will be concentrated on Holyhead and Rhyl,\" Mr David Farnsworth, the WDA's director in charge of its urban programme, says. \"We can see great market opportunities in these two towns. Each has declined, economically and environmentally, and their decline is clearly affecting the economy of north Wales. \"While we are looking at spe- cific towns this year, we also want to look at Deeside, which is really a mini-conurbation. By the end of this month we should have worked out a multi-million pound pro- gramme for the area which can be put to both the agency and the local authorities. \"Our aim is avoid the experi- ence of the English urban development corporations such as London and Bristol which have been at odds with their local authorities and we have taken the councils into our thinking at every stage.\" The success of all these pro- jects - the road, the urban regeneration, the capital spending - will eventually be measured by the extent to which the more westerly parts of north Wales achieve greater prosperity. Gwynedd county council has its own plans to create facto- ries and site in small towns like Porthmadoc, Penrhyndeu- draeth, Llandegai and Caernar- son. It is working closely with the WDA to enhance its health care industry, which is grow- ing, and media sector, which is strongly entrenched (especially in television and radio). Mr Dafydd Jones, the county's economic develop- ment officer, says that with the increasing acceptance of the concept of electronic home- workers and telecentres as a result of advances in telecom- munications technology, there is no reason why small busi- nesses should not settle and prosper in Gwynedd. The WDA has actually put money through a rural initia- tive into a technology resource centre in Porthmadoc. Mr Jones says that with the county's environmental resources there could hardly be a better place in which to work. From his office he can ee Caernarfon Castle, another of the world's great castles, and over his shoulder is Snow- don. It is, as he says with remarkable understatement, not a bad place in which to live and work. Anwtony Moreon",

   "text_content" : "Swane Dock-* now t uure looks brighter ~$ b. \"i: a; I*iÂ·rÂ·;:''3.'Â·: IT HAS become conventional wisdom to assert now that ports on the west side of Britain are seriously disadvan- taged as a result of the coun- try's trade increasingly moving towards Europe. One who has never accepted that port operators should sit back and watch them gently wither is Mr Govan Davies at Pembroke Dock who argues that the improved road net- work would offer unparalleled opportunities for Welsh ports in particular, as well as others on Britain's west coast, to cap- ture trade that might have gone to docks further east. Rising trade this year within the Milford Haven port com- plex, which includes Pembroke Dock, lends substance to the Davies view; throughput was up 11 per cent between Janu- ary and July this year com- pared with the same months in 1990. The Davies view is gathering strength. Abolition of the national dock labour scheme two years ago has liberated the five South Wales ports con- trolled by Associated British Ports (ABP) - .Newport, Car- diff, Barry, Port Talbot and Swansea - one of which could \"It is an exciting time In port management. Operators are putting In money. They were loth while the dock scheme was In force\" have closed before the end of the decade. Now, according to Mr Stuart Bradley, managing director of ABP, the situation has been transformed. \"It is an exciting time to be in port manage- ment,\" he says. \"We are get- ting operators into the docks, who are putting their own investment in. They were extremely loth to do this while the dock labour scheme was in force.\" He points to the example of Newport where Silcock Express and International Motors have both taken unused land and developed a car-handling export-import business. This investment is not unique in Wales. Sealink Stena is coming to the end of a Elm project at Holyhead and the oil company Elf, which bought the Gulf refinery at Milford Haven last year, is undertaking a large amount of work in the port which should increase the throughput. Mr Maurice Storey, a direc- tor of Sealink Stena, says that the Holybead programme has included infrastructure work as a Joint venture with British Rail and Anglesey Council to complem nent work being under taken in the town by the local authority and the Welsh Devel opment Agency. Within the port the invest- ment has gone towards a deep- water berth. Holyhead will now be able to berth the new generation of large roll-on roll off freighters which were previ ously kept out because of the port's relatively shallow water. Throughput in both Holyhead and Fishguard has been expanding and Mr Storey is confident that with extra ves- sels, and more money spent on the vessels themselves, such as the Â£7m refit on the Stena Hib- ernia, this trend will continue. On the Holyhead-to-Dun Laoghaire run passenger traf- sic went up by 10 per cent last year and the number of cars by 16 per cent. In the south, on the Fishguard-Rosslare run, passengers and car traffic rose by about 10 per cent despite the Swansea Cork Ferries bringing back a summer ser- vice and fierce competition from a Pembroke-to-Cork run. \"Traffic to Ireland has been building up by a steady 3-4 per cent a year,\" Mr Storey says, \"which augurs well for future expansion at the ports.\" Milford Haven's problems are different. Being outside the 1 dock labour scheme, no bene- fits accrued from abolition. Its problems relate to the future of the trust ports, of which it is one. Government plans to put these ports on the market will be opposed by Milford Haven according to Mr Michael Hys- lop, general manager of its port authority. \"Running the navi- gation of a port such as ours,\" he says, \"is rather different from running a dock-oriented one. With our large oil throughput we have to be par- ticularly mindful of the envi- ronmental needs of the area.\" Milford Haven is also a con- servancy authority, which dis- tinguishes us from other ports in Wales. \"Our relationship with the three major custom- ers has also to be considered.\" The port is a vital landing point for Gulf Oil, Elf and Tex- aco and if any one of those were to become the controlling authority on privatisation it could affect relations with the others. \"For those reasons we feel privatisation is unlikely to be suitable here at the moment.\" It is in the four dock labour scheme ports owned by ABP, though, that the real changes can be seen. The fifth, Port Tal- bot, is a slight exception. ABP owns the port but British Steel has a long lease on it and brings in all the iron ore and coking coal it needs for the nearby steelworks and for tran- shipment by rail to the Llan- wern works at Newport. To all intents, this is a steelworks-ori- ented docks. The other four were built around the middle of the last century to handle coal exports from the pits of the South Wales valleys. That trade has all-but disappeared, though there is a small but growing trade in coal imports. The ports, Mr Bradley con- cedes, faced an uncertain future had the dock labour scheme remained. \"They were struggling and while no deci- sions had been made, one won- ders if they would all have been open and working in 10 years' time. \"Now the position has been completely altered and they look forward to a future with some confidence. All of them have improved their perfor- mance with total traffic since abolition up by 7-8 per cent. Barry has expanded its fruit and vegetables trade, Newport, with its nearness to the motor- way system, is also doing well with fruit and there is a signifi- cant timber trade in both New- port and Cardiff. \"All the ports are operating on a low-cost basis now,\" he says. \"We no longer have to carry the high fixed costs involved in the labour scheme and we have gained freedom of action.\" ABP has one other great advantage. Through Grosvenor Waterside it is developing up to 160 acres in Cardiff for lei- sure, offices and hotels around its waterfront, part of the rede- velopment of Cardiff Bay. The centrepiece of this develop- ment will be an opera house for the Welsh capital which will be home to the renowned Welsh National Opera Com- pany. Cardiff was the largest coal- exporting port in the world in its Edwardian heyday. With the opening of the opera house the area could gain a new kind of glory."

   "text_content" : "DEEP RECESSION? So what? That is the attitude Mr Ian Spratling adopts as he gets on with the Job of chairing the Swansea Bay Partnership: a community of towns, county and government agency which is striving to bring fresh business to the far west of Britain. The optimism may be professionally ,adopted, but the energy which is being poured into the partnership by Swansea city, the towns of Neath, Port Talbot and Llanelli together with smaller bor- oughs, the counties of Dyfed and West Glamorgan, and the Welsh Develop- ment Agency, cannot be denied. That they have persuaded 32 private companies to join them in the midst of a black recession in an ambitious plan to renew the economy of south-west Wales, is a tribute to Mr Spratling's commitment and that of all his fellow executives. It also makes the Swansea Bay Partnership one of the govern- ment's better ideas in 1989. Government backing initially amounted to a commitment to fund administration costs of Â£250,000 for just two years. But when the period expired last March, the partnership's remit was renewed for a further two years. It is also on the brink of winning a further year's subsidy from the European Regional Development Fund which will extend its life into 1994. Some uncertainties remain. The gov- ernment's suggestion (no more than a debating point so far) that local govern- ment should be reduced to a single layer - the so-called \"unitary arrange- ments\" - would threaten some of the partners. No-one can yet be certain whether county, district or parish coun- cils are the most likely to be aed. A general election before the period Is up adds another factor, and a pened or prolonged recession could in the patnership if its members think they must concentrate on charity at home.. Short of all these elements turning sour, however, the partnership looks both stable and effective. In fact, according to Mr Spratling, \"the next three years should be better thani the last two\". That is quite a claim. In the 1989-90 fiscal year new business invest-. ment in the Swansea Bay area totalled Â£106m. The following year that had soared to 3SO0m and the partnership could claim responsibility for bringing in 513 new jobs, or seven of the 28 projects. Largest of all the converts so far has been Alberto Culver, the haircare prod- ucts manufacturer whose capital invest- ment has topped Â£7m. But partnership officials confidently expect that figure shortly to be topped. \"We have four major companies plus 30 smaller ones showing strong possibilities of moving into the region,\" says Mr Spratling, \"and several of those are much larger than Culver\". That view is shared by Mr Mike Bourke, his chief executive, who con- firms that the area is particularly attractive to US companies looking to expand eastward into the European Community and eastern Europe but wanting the reassurance of a common language, culture and political stability. \"Americans feel relaxed in Britain,\" says Mr Bourke. For those without the deep pockets of the top multinationals in the Dow Jones Index, there is the attraction of low land prices relative to the rest of Bitain. \"If industrial development' land costs around Â£800,000 an acre at Heath- row, it is only Â£45,000 down here,\" Mr Bourke points out. Not that the new masters of ,south-west Wales are ready to welcome every new arrival with open arms. Swansea - and even more, Port Talbot and Neath - have had their fill of sus- fering local economies which danced to the tune of a single cyclical industry. The area never wants'to be dependent again on a single employer. Today's measured development is to be based on diversity. What that means in practice has already changed in the two years since the partnership was formed. \"Last year the companies we talk to were predomi- nantly in the service sector,\" Mr Spratl- ing says. \"This year they are manufac- turers, mostly in light engineering. Manufacturing tends to create more jobs.\" Mr Bourke shares that view: \"I do not see how you can ever have an economy that is service-led. It would be like the mythical island whose inhabitants eked out a precarious living taking in each other's washing. Services must be there to support or give a push to manufac- turing.\" As a part of the service sector itself, the partnership's task is both to push productive industries to choose the Swansea Bay region and to support them with suitable premises and attractive commercial and social facili- ties. The M4 motorway connection to both London and the Midlands is a 4trng card in theaprtnershp 's bnd. So is the'stable wr .ore; With labour turnover of less than 6 pdr cent a year even in bbom times, Mr Spratlng says he can make a rfeal fture out of staff loyalty. The reciprocal of that, he concedes, is to attract companies which deserve that loyalty. In the search for investors who will create long-term jobs suited to the skills of the local workforce, Mr Spratl- ing is more than ready to pay tribute to the role of the Welsh Development Agency. \"I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the WDA,\" he says. \"In their travels abroad, they frequently come across companies that fit our pro- file. They pass on the names and then stand back and let us get on with it It is a terribly good working partnership.\" That partnership, plus the executives' own efforts and advisers have paid early dividends. Besides the manufac- turers like Culver and Fiox, the fibre optics group which invested in a Â£2m factory in Port Talbot last year, there have been some prize catches from the service sector. All the back office work for Lloyds Bank's Cox & King's Pall Mall branch is now handled from a building in the Swansea Enterprise Park, while the Inland Revenue is on the point of expanding its centre there to 551,000 sq ft, thus creating 270 jobs. If this trend continues at the pace of the sad decline in Welsh rugby, the day may come before the end of the partner- ship's current remit when Port Talbot and Neath will be known for men in suits and boilersuits rather than jer- seys.",

   "text_content" : "THESE DAYS development in South Wales is inextricably linked to the notion of river barrage schemes - a highly controversial form of environ- mental engineering. No fewer than three towns in the area are building or planning to build barrages as the corner- stones of urban regeneration projects, writes Christine Moir. Controversy has dogged all three in proportion to their size and relation to the town's cen- tral core. Thus Cardiff, where the barrage has been publicly called the cornerstone of the Cardiff Bay redevelopment, has faced the most outspoken criti- cism, followed by Newport, whose River Usk barrage plan will indelibly change an area running right through the core of the town. By contrast, Swansea's River Tawe barrage, which is less central to the town and to its main development area, has successfully run the gauntlet of environmental objections and is already well advanced. While the other two are still in the throes of the consulta- tion process, conservation groups which had hoped to halt them seem likely to be dis- appointed. Cardiff's private barrage bill may have col- lapsed in Parliament in April, but Mr David Hunt, the Welsh Secretary, has just reaffirmed his intention to reintroduce it as a government bill in Novem- ber. For its part Newport, which withdrew its bill earlier this year, has a fixed date - November 27 - for its rein- troduction in amended form. Supporters are daily regain- ing their optimism, particu- larly as amendments to the schemes are seen to be success- ful in addressing the most pressing oojecuons to me orgi- nal plans. In Newport, for instance, the nub of the criti- cisms had been the question of safe passage up and down the Usk for migratory fish. Mr Roger Davies, manager of the River Usk Regeneration Proj- ect, is now confident that this issue has been resolved. \"We will create a variation of the revolutionary Borland fish pass, involving twin locks which fish will be able to use to move either from higher to lower levels or in reverse order,\" says Mr Davies. \"In addition, on more than half of all tides fish will be able to swim over the barrage, across half the river's width.\" In Cardiff, one of the main concerns has been aesthetic: objectors have feared that Car- diff Bay would simply be sealed off by an ugly concrete wall. On September 4, how- ever, Mr Geoffrey Inkin, chair- man of the Cardiff Bay Rede- velopment Corporation, was able to unveil the final design form of the barrage showing that Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, the engineers, have made public access and enjoy- ment of the area a top priority. The barrage itself will be landscaped to form a park sim- ilar in style and size to the town's Sophia Gardens. A freshwater lake will be created with fishing piers and groynes, backed by walled gardens, pic- nic areas and lavish planting on the embankment itself. Redesigned sluice gates will not only offer greater flood pro- tection than the originals but involve less intrusive construc- tion. They will also be used to flush out the lower parts of the bay, improving its water qual- ity, and have a slightly larger capacity to take into account any rise in sea levels which might be caused by the green- house effect. Water quality has also been a concern at Newport but a report commissioned from Environmental Resources, independent consultants, sug- gests it may even be improved by the barrage. Environmental Resources, which has been used by the European Commission, the Channel Tunnel contractors and on the Merseyside Sea Bar rage, points out that the bar rage across the Usk will reduce scouring of the banks upstream, making it more likely that otters will recolon ise the area once it has been cleaned up and replanted. That assessment forms part of the vital environmental statement which had been delayed by two years of unusu- ally dry weather. That delay prompted the borough council to have the parliamentary bill *withdrawn. Since May, however, the statement has been circulated to members of the environmen- tal consultative committee which includes the National Rivers Authority, Nature Con- servancy Council and a range of fishing and conservation groups, including the Gwent Wildlife Trust. By early September only the National Rivers Authority, one of the petitioners against the original bill, had givenits views, but Mr Davies was con sident that the consultation process would speed up now that the holiday season is past. One of the key amendments to the original bill, which i expected to appease many of the envirormental groups, is the inclusion of an advisory committee on the management of the barrage which will be able to guarantee that it is used sensitively so as to create the least disturbance. For its part, the local author- ity is all the more committed to the barrage project since receiving an economic report from management consultants, Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, which favours the barrage above a bridge or a limited ren- ovation of the old dockside. The consultants believe the Â£42.4m barrage scheme, which involves developing 365,000 sq ft of industrial space and 515,000 sq ft of offices together with 2,400 houses, plus leisure and retail facilities, is the best chance to repair a century of neglect and dereliction and cre- ate an area which would attract new investment and quality housing to an attrac- tive environment. In Cardiff the docklands development corporation is equally certain that the bar- rage is \"absolutely central if we are to realise the full poten- tial of the bay,\" as Mr Inkin said on unveiling the detailed design. He expects it to provide \"many thousands of jobs\". The Cardiff Bay barrage is an integral part of the city's most important development project. This is not true of Swansea's barrage scheme which is somewhat peripheral to the key development areas in the Swansea Bay Partner- ship. Although the barrage across the River Tawe will result in a clean-up of derelict riverside, create a maritime quarter and attract a Â£150m investment by Associated Brit- ish Ports in the planned Port Tawe development, it has not received nearly so much pub- licity as the Cardiff barrage. Cynics suggest that this is why it is so much further advanced. Whatever the rea- son, the Â£13m construction contract was awarded nearly a year ago, and development is expected to be completed by 1994. In all three cases, however, environmentalists have proved that their concerns cannot sim- ply be ignored and their fears and objections will continue to be effective influences even after all three schemes have been - as seems likely - approved and built.",

   "text_content" : "ONE-OFF commercial property deals - be they lettings or Investment purchases - are thin on the pound everywhere round the country. Tenants are rarely in the mood to con- sider future accommodation Aeeds; short-term ressure to survive mop Ip au the diree- tors' energies. Long-term investors, disillusioned with the performance of their prop- erty portfolios, are in no rush to ca llthe bottom of the mar- ket and start buying again. Wales Is not immune from these baleful influences, but it does display some defensive qualities In recession that are not shared by other regions. Access for one: anywhere in South Wales is little more than a hop from Bristol these days along the M4, and the upgrading of the Heads of the Valleys Road to Merthyr is reinforcing the valley towns' climb out of the coal era. The Welsh Development Agency for another: town planners and development offi- cers throughout the principal- ity are united in commending the commitment and under- standing that the WDA brings to its role. A third factor is the success the people of Wales have shown in adapting from tradi- tional heavy industries to such sectors as financial services. Success breeds success; and since thousands of Insurers and investment advisers have ousted the miners of south- east Wales, a continuing stream of high tech companies has been encouraged to pin- point the area. These factors have devel- oped self-confidence at local level to the point where sev- eral towns have embarked on ambitions central area rede- velopment schemes in defiance of the recession. Newport, the first town encountered on driving into South Wales, is completely revamping its centre with the help of the WDA and govern- ment grant-aided refurbish- ment, particularly in the High Street, is beginning to give the town a buzz. There have been disappoint- ments: the town was hoping to renovate its bus station as part of a Â£100m 220,000 sq ft commercial development by the Barton Property Trust: thit is now on ice. But other ambitios projects - the 150- acre Celtic Liakes area for light indutry close to both Imperial Park and Tredegar, and Lang-y tone Park on the eastern edge of the town where Stakis has already opened a hotel - look promiising. Local agents report that commercial rents in Newport, while not rising, have held steady during the recession. Prime office space would com mand about Â£12 a sq ft, though the lack of recent lettings makes that figure a bit of a guess. Industrial activity has held up better, with small units fetching Â£5, and those over 10,000 sq ft approaching Â£4.50. Agents Debenham Tewson & Chinnocks report the recent letting at Â£4.25 of a 25,000 sq ft newly-built unit on Queen- sway Meadows (a joint devel- opment by the WDA and Bai- ley Group) as a recent benchmark. In the capital itself, the past year has been very quiet; the last significant office letting - at Â£16.40 - was last autumn when the Company of Design- ers, an architectural practice, took space in Sun Alliance's Windsor Place. Just out of the centre prices fall to Â£11.50 and there is no avoiding a verdict of over-supply. Yet agents have detected some stirrings in recent weeks, led by industrial units which fetch Â£5.75 at the small end, and Â£5 for large units. In the city core, all eyes are peeled for signs of activity at Imperial Gate, the planned development by Regalian Properties which has not got beyond site demolition. Cardiff's tight retail heart may also be stirring. Recent encouragement has come with 'he opening of the Capital Cen- tre at the top end of the Hign Street which has persuaded Jaeger to move from Queen Street, previously the unassail- -ble spot for high fashion. On the extreme eastern edge of the Bay area the proposed Pengham Green shopping cen- tre has not yet attracted a developer, but the county is pushing ahead with its Capital Waterside scheme to the south of County Hall, and brain's mixed brewery, residential, retail, restaurant and studios complex, The Wharf, is letting well. Swansea's town centre is even tighter than Cardiff which is proving no bad thing during the recession. Office rents have scarcely topped Â£8 and supply remains more than dequate. Yet the Enterprise Park within the Swansea Bay area is coming back to life of a sort with terms just agreed on a 110,000 sq ft industrial unit, albeit at below Â£2.50. In the valleys industrial rents hover around the Â£3.50 mark which has not led pri- vate developers to muscle in on the WDA's patch. But retail schemes may prove more of a draw when some towns put their plans out to tender. Caer- philly and Llanelli are con- ducting feasibility plans at present, while in west Wales, Mr Richard Branson is sitting on a site close to Tesco ready to pick his moment. Lampeter too has a proposed centre waiting to go. For those companies in a position to make their prop- erty moves, the increase in supply and generally quiet commercial scene, is a gift. From the WDA to county eco- nomic development depart- ments and firms of specialist advisers, everyone is ready to tailor a proposal to suit the incomer. One such adviser is Integra, set up two years ago by Mr Wyn Price, a former WDA offi cial, to assist companies want- ing to move into west Wales. Since 1989 Mr Price has brought forward Â£12m of industrial property deals on 126,000 sq ft, mostly in small factory units. Current projects, for over another 45,000 sq ft are being negotiated at Ammanford, Dafen, Bridgend and Portardulais. Integra's deals rely heavily on grants, both from the UK government and the European Coal and Steel Community. But the number of companies seeking to take up the funds is an indication of the area's fun- damental attractions. Christine Moir",

   "text_content" : "WJALKS I AS not done as well from tourism as it might. The country has a rich and varied environment with national -arks, areas of outstanding beauty and 300 miles of heri- tage coast. These make up a quarter of the total land are of the principality. There are more castles per square mile in Wales than in any other country in Europe Most stand in magnificent surroundings. These settings, together with standing stones, hermit caves, cathedrals and churches reflect the pre- history, pre-Christian and Christian past of Wales. Its ancient culture and distinct identity with its own language can be seen in pag- eants and festivals. There are mountains, rivers and rugged coastline for activity holidays of all kinds fishing, walking or climbing breaks. Yet, despite all this, in rela- tive terms, Wales does not seem to have built up a tourist industry comparable with other Celtic countries or areas with similar attractions, such as Scotland or Cornwall or Ireland, particularly when it comes to upmarket and inter- national tourism. In 1990 there were around 8.5m tourist trips. This probably means there were between 3m to 4m tourists, assuming an average stay of three or four nights. This was more than Cornwall which in the same year probably had fewer than 3m tourists. But Cornwall is much smaller and less accessible. Moreover, of the total tourist \"spend\" of around Â£1.4m in 1990, day visitors accounted for 2375m. Foreign visitors contrib- uted only Â£117m. Compara- tively speaking, this is a small proportion of what interna- tional tourism earned for Scot- land. A United Kingdom Tourism Survey (UKTS), sponsored jointly by the national tourist boards for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, found in 1989 that Wales earned less than 2 per cent of the total foreign tourist spend in Britain and Northern Ireland. Part of the reason why tourism lags behind is that, until quite recently, South Wales hardly needed to encourage visitors. It was an area of heavy industry: coal and steel. True, the mountains of North Wales attracted walkers and climbers and the coastal resorts appealed to old-style bucket-and-spade holiday makers. Indeed, two-thirds of all holidays taken in Wales are on the coast. These are at bed- and-breakfast or budget hotels, or at self-catering properties or at the numerous caravan or camping parks. The resort towns, with the arguable exception of Llan- dudno, do not really cater for conferences or upmarket short- break holidays. The official attitude towards tourism has changed radically in the past few years as the realisation has sunk in that the industry is a growth area which can be a huge revenue earner for the country. An international passenger survey recently estimated that the number of overseas visitors to the UK grew by 4 per cent between 1989 and 1990 to nearly 18m. Their spending went up 11 per cent to Â£7.7'lbn. As the traditional industries have declined, Wales has discovered, as other parts of the UK have done, that it has assets which can be turned to good account. The Wales Tourist Board is spending Elm over five years from 1989 in the South Wales valleys. The money will be spent on projects and environ- ment improvements. The hope is that the money will lever out further investment from the private sector. At the same time, the brew- eries have been improving their pubs and in some cases converting them to hotels. Hotel groups have also been building in the valleys, which were once neglected. Using money available under Section 4 of the 1969 Tourism Act, the board is spending Elm each in three resorts: Langollen, Rhyl/Prestatyn and Tenby. And Â£lm each will be allocated to three historic towns: Chepstow, Conwy and LI dod Wells, These'come under the toardrt board', l;Wa -ente and dovelopment progranime Othr t e Icldr M800 000 for country house hte up to Â£00,0 so r coaching hotels, up to 000,i000 for development of unique ttractions of national or Interi national sgnlflcance and up t 0MOOO0 for the development of activity centres of quality. The board will spend more than 20m to assist potential developers of all-year holiday complexes in areas of high -opulation catchment, according to Mr Norman Poole, a director. That is apart from the S25m annual budget used for promotion and administra- tion. In all areas, the hope is that the money will be closely co-or dinated with private sector inance and that a greater pro portion of private capital will be levered out. One area in which private investment is taking place is country house hotels. Welsh Water, the privatised utility, has bought five of these. Mr John Elfed Jones, the chair- man of Welsh Water is an avid fisherman, and a great Welsn patriot. The idea is that these hotels will be developed as upmarket The per t LUeandu : fishing and walking lodges, along the lines of the hotels in Scotland besides the salmon rivers. Apart from being a fish- erman, Mr Jones has an inter- est in maintaining river qual- ity. Another area that seems ripe for development is first-class hotels with golf courses. At least three of these were under consideration not too long ago. One of these was foreseen as being the Gleneagles of Wales. But recession may have killed off one or more of these golf courses for the time being. Mr Poole feels it is a \"bit unfair\" to say that Wales has lost out to Scotland. \"We do not have the same instantly recognisable products as Scot- land like whisky for example.\" But he admits that more should be done to attract for- eign visitors. Mr Jones goes further. He says that a lot more should be done to upgrade the tourist industry. \"Nowhere here is on the international circuit ezcep Chester and technically speak- ing that is in England. We should do more to promote ourselves, particularly in the US.\" By the end of the century, Cardiff could have an opera house on the bay to rival any. Though its castle is not as majestic as Edinburgh's, it is well preserved but few people outside the principality know it is there. Wales needs to get on the lucrative international circuit.

   "text_content" : "FIVE YTEARS ago, Techniquest was just an idea in the mind of John Beetlestone, then professor of science education at Car- diE's university college. Today, it is the second largest visitor attraction in the Welsh capital, bowing the knee only to the city's castle, writes Anthony Moreton. Techniquest is a hands-on centre full of objects designed to illustrate scientific matters. Just inside the front door is a Bernoulli Blower in which a beach ball appears to be suspended in mid-air. It looks like gravity being defied; but Ber- noulli devised the process 200 years ago and there is no trick. Air s pumped out at an angle and the ball is caught in the slipstream. \"fry it with your vacuum cleaner attachment and a table-tennis ball,\" Pro- fesor Beetlestone says. \"The principle is the same whatever the mechanics of the operation.\" xTechn liquest is fMI of such exhib its.: Its aim is to \"educate by stealth through let asre activities,\" he says. Mr Beetlestone simply babbles with enthusiasm as he moves from object to object. The idea behind Techniquest i nothing new. Hands-on centres were born in North America in the late 1960s, with Exploratorium at San Francisco and the- Ontario Science Centre in Toronto. They are, however, relatively new to the UK. Prof Richard Gregory's Exploratory i. Bristol was the first in the UK, closely followed by Techniquest. There are now getting on for a dozen, including one in the Science Museum in London. Techniquest is now attracting 114,000 visitors a year, many in school parties, and Prof Beetlestone has ambitious plans to move to larger premises. Others have r-esponded to his enthusiasm, notably the rGtsby Charitable Foundation, David Sainsbury's pesonami trust, which put In =n initial Â£83,000 and followed with a further Â£600,000. ASW, the Cardiff steel company, Associated British Ports, the Nuffield Foundation, Marks and Spencer and Cardiff Bay Development Corporation nave all put up money. Now Shell has come forward with a Â£250,000 grant to allow Prof Beetlestone's team to see if ways can be found to present chemistry in the science centre. \"The trouble with chemistry,\" he says. -is that it is smelly, often needs heat and can sometimes be dangerous. It we could finad a way to make it adaptable to the hands-on treatment all our pieces or equipment go through, it would be an enormous breakthrough in the under- standing of this branch of science.\" You come away with the feeling that Ri anyone can achieve that breakthrough i:t will be John Beet lstore.",

   "text_content" : "WHER TVl steeilworks awle stlessl over a scene on on the edge of Ebbw Vale in south-east WPle same' 8.0 e and shrubs have been plainted. The trans- ormi an ris eaiy amazinu by the time the Ubbw Vale GearnPi etlval opens on May iieuxt year the greening of the valley will be complete. Mr Robert Webb, chief exec- utive of the festival company, has been cautious in his esti- mates of the number of visitors - Ebbw Vale is, after all, in a relatively remote, rural area - but he will be disappointed if there are not at least 2m for the five months of the festival. A working farm and moun- tain railway, a greenhouse dis- playing exotic blooms from Singapore, a wetlands develop- ment sponsored by British Coal which has stumped up Â£300,000 in recognition of its historical links with the town, and overall supervision by Dutch horticultural designers are all evidence of the plan- ning which has been put in. Efforts have also been made to pack the festival with attrac- tions beyond the 95-acre gar- den site itself. In what Mr Webb calls a series of \"festivals within the festival\", the site will host an American festival, a Keep Fit event and a Schools fea4hval Hale',e enmine t+aALt tions will be maintained by a of an exchange of choirs i Baden-Wurttemberg. However successful the festi- val itself though, what matters is what comes afterwards when the tents and pavilions have made way for the permanent housing and commercial dwell- ings which, it is hoped, will rejuvenate an area of nearly 200 acres and bring new eco- nomic prosperity to the town. Backed by the Welsh Office and the Welsh Development Agency, and with the support of Gwent County Council and the surrounding local authori- ties, Ebbw Vale expects to mar- shal Â£20m of public money for the redevelopment project. A similar sum is hoped for from the private sector by way of inward investment into the area and a residual Â£5m or so may come from selling assets left over from the festival. For the moment, those two latter sums are just back-of-en- velope guesses while a joint working party thrashes out the detailed after-use plan. But the prospects are promising, according to Mr Andy Fretter, assistant county planning offi- cer for Gwent and a member of the working party. Already, it is agreed that the bulk of the commercial part of the site should be redeveloped as a business park to attract a better class of business than has historically been associ- ated with the valleys: more ser- vice industries including sinan- cial services. \"Ebbw Vale is not going to attract TSB-type investment (as Newport on the M4 corridor has done),\" says Mr Fretter. \"But we know of others in the same sector looking for better-value-for- money premises, and one or two actively looking for valley locations.\" Gwent is very active in the IT Wales Initiative which has attracted international com- puter majors such as Aiwa into the valleys. It will hope to build on that in Ebbw Vale. \"We also expect local indus- tries to see it as a natural focus for expansion,\" says Mr Fret- ter. \"Environmentally, it will be the most attractive site in South Wales with its mixture of landscaping, environmental- ly-sensitive housing, open space and business park. I am confident that it will all be developed within five years.\" Care has been taken to match the enhancement of the immediate area with improved infrastructure and access to the town. Three months ago, the Welsh Office announced the upgrading to dual carriagen way of the final stretch of the Heads of the Valleys road - the seven miles between Aber- gavenny and Ebbw Vale. That will take several years to com- plete but the last of the bottle- necks in the route down the valley, particularly round Cwm, will be eliminated in the next three years. Thus, while Ebbw Vale's rural charm is to be main- tained, the town will become easily accessible for all short of those needing full-scale motor- way facilities. Yet questionmarks still hang over the future of the town once the festival tents have been folded. Ebbw Vale's will be the fifth - and last - gar- den festival in Britain. Mod- elled on a European concept, they have not taken quite so well on British soil and the results of the previous four have been mixed. At Stoke, for instance, the heavily industrialised nature of the town did not lend itself to an outstanding garden display. Yet the increase in inward investment since the end of its festival has been encouraging. Liverpool's less successful out- come may have been due to its size: possibly it was too large a city to benefit from the boost that a garden festival can bring, although Glasgow's town planners claim that their festival had a measurable effect on inward investment. Gateshead, with its indus- trial past and immediate access to open countryside, may be the most comparable of the previous four, although Ebbw Vale does not have a large neighbour - Newcastle - looming over it. And, since Gateshead's festival has been judged a success if not a run- away hit, Ebbw Vale must hope that the similarities out- weigh the differences between the two. Christine Moir",

UK eldsrg k s km eiRg N.O 1.5 pWr Mt from Spmtubr 4. 131 Merrill Lynch claimed recently that trends in long-term interest rates, economic growth and inflation differentials suggest that the dollar could rise above DM2.00 in the next year, but said that the trend will probably be restrained by other factors anu the likely level in 12 months is DM1.80. Merrill Lynch also stated that the dollar is undervalued by 7.65 per cent in terms of Purchasing Power Parity, but admitted that there have been times when it has been under or over valued by 20 per cent or more.

The urinciples of PPP gauge what a currency should be worth ir relation to a country's rate of inflation. According to this theory over the next 12 months the dollar will rise. to DM2.39 against the D-Mark and sterling will fall to $1.57, giving an implied value for the pound of DM3.75. This of course fails to take into account other factors, such as the linkage of the D-Mark and the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism. Nomura points out that the whole point of the ERM is to insure that measures are taken to enable currencies to avoid the implications of PPP. Nomura forecasts that rather than rise the dollar is likely to fall to DM1.60 and that sterling will rise to $1.83, putting the pound's D-Mark value at a more acceptable DM2.9280. The conclusions of this exercise are that PPP cannot be used unless currencies are free floating and even then no forecasts can be made with confidence for periods shorter than five years.

   "text_content" : "Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, talks to Peter Norman t is unlikely that Mr Nor- man Lamont would be cen- tral casting's first choice to play the Iron Chancellor in an epic about the British econ- omy. At 49, his youthful, puckish face creases too easily into a smile. He has a disconcerting habit of chuckling while dis- cussing the most serious mat- ters. But since taking over as chancellor of the exchequer nine and a half months ago, Mr Lamont has been unwavering in his determination' to bring down Britain's rate of infla- tion. And in an interview atNo 1 Downing Street last week, he made clear that reducing inflation remains \"very much my overriding objective\". His goal has meant a steely adherence to austerity that seems difficult to reconcile with his well-known fondness for parties and the good things of life. But it matches his roots. For although Mr Lamont looks every inch the merchant banker that he once was, friends testify to a streak of puritanism and melancholy in his character that is typical of windswept Shetland where he was born. The past nine months have been a testing time for a man whose promotion to the chan- cellorship was seen by many as a reward for the successful management of John Major's leadership campaign rather than a natural step up the greasy pole of politics. It has meant sticking to an unpopular policy of only grudgingly reducing interest rates against a background of soaring unemployment, rising bankruptcies and house repos- sessions. Mr Lamont has been subjected to savage criticism from some of the Conservative party's traiitionial su pporters in the press. There have recently been whispers at Westminster that his relations with the prime minister are not what they were, when he acted as kingmaker to Mr Major. The chancellor dismisses such talk. He says he has an \"extremely easy and good rela- tionship\" with John Major, sees him privately every week and talks all the time on the telephone with him. His forthright answer con- trasts with an otherwise cau- tious way of dealing with ques- tions. Mr Lamont picks his words with care, often pausing in mid-sentence, in a way that carries hints of the Scottish accent that he lost during his progress through Cambridge and Conservative politics. But natural caution apart, the chancellor looks relaxed. That is because he feels the economy is going hi way. He says he is \"increasingly confident\" that there will be a recovery in the second half of this year. \"Britain is coming out of recession,\" he says. \"I think we are at or around the turning point. The statistics are highly encouraging and pointing very much in the right direction.\" \"It won't be a smooth recov- ery. Life doesn't consist of straight lines there are always jagged edges,\" he says. How- ever, he recalls that there has been a very considerable relax- ation of policy in recent months to help it on its way. But hasn't pegging sterling to the D-mark in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System, doomed the UK to a future of low growth and high unem- ployment of the kind France experienced during the 1980s? \"I don't think it follows, because we are better posi- tioned than France was when it joined the ERM... We fought a battle against infla- tion and had low inflation iiin the mid-Eighties. The reduc- tion we are having to make now, difficult though it has been, is not what it was in 1980-81. But furthermore the supply-side changes - the greater productivity, the flexi- bility, the competitiveness, the improved industrial relations - all those things put us in a much stronger position than France was when it first joined the ERM. I don't think it fol- lows, though I know a lot of people say this, that we have to have a long period of nig- gardly growth.\" Looking back on his term as chancellor, he is pleased with progress. \"I do actually thnk* that tfie last nine months have really gone quite well. It has been extremely difficult, but we've managed to reduce infla- tion, to less than half what it was,we've managed to make reductions in interest rates that some people at this time last autumn thought couldn't be done, we've managed to build up our credibility within the ERM and we've also had a Budget that I think had some worthwhile long-term reforms, but also had a dramatic switch from local to central govern- ment taxation, and reduced community charge bills by 140 quid.\" Mr Lamont's message is that these achievements will help the government win the next election in spite of rising unemployment and recent riots in Britain's cities. \"The percep \"Tony Andm ritain is cominu out of recesm Â·:i r: Â·r :Â· \":: '' ~:Â·Â·- ~;IÂ·-Â·-Â· Â·Â·Â·~Â·; ? ..... ,I8Â·;~?iÂ·: Â·~Â·Â·:Â· Â·i:Â·; '''~: :I:..Lr :.LÂ· Â·Â·i~] Â·;~;:,- Â·-Â·Â·Â· \"';I~ i:\":\":L'\":: 'Â·i \"~ i ~,r Â·Â·Â·~.'Â·~-,trl~':Â· ~Â·..-Â· tion of the economy has changed markedly and confi- dence has very considerably improved, particularly con- sumer confidence,\" he says. \"I think the electorate will give credit to a government that has done what it believes is the right thing - that is, not cho- sen the easy way, but has actu- ally stuck to its guns, stuck to its interest rate policy and has manifestly behaved in a pr- dent and responsible way.\" ERSONAL FILE 1942 Born Lerwick, Shetland. 1963 Chairman Cambridge University Conservative Association. 1964 President, Cambridge Union. 1968 Joins NM Rothschild - Sons. 1972 Elected Conservative MP for Kingston-upon- Thames. 1981 Minister of state, Depart- ment of Trade and Industry. 1985 Minister of state for defence procurement. 1986 Financial secretary to the Treasury. 1989 Chief secretary to the Treasury. 1990 Chancellor of the exche quer. He forecasts that the results of the government's economic policy \"are going to be increas- mgly clear as the months go by,\" adding \"I think we will win the election, whenever it is\". So does this talk of months going by, mark him down as preferring an election in 1992 rather than this autumn? He hesitates before finding a suitably ambiguous formula. \"We're well positioned when ever it comes,\" he says. Whatever the electoral pres sures, the chancellor has no intention of easing up in his battle against inflation. \"The battle against inflation is a bat- tle that has to be fought all the time,\" he says. His aim of making Britain \"a low-inflation country perma- nently\" runs like a thread through his discussion of eco- nomic policy. Sound and pru- dent financial policies will be the hallmark of the govern- ment's next term of office, although he also wants further privatisation and tax reform as part of a programme of build- ing on the supply-side changes of the 1980s. His determination \"to lock us into a low rate of inflation and achieve convergence\" of economic performance with the UK's partners in the Euro- pean Community also under- pins his approach to the cur- rent negotiations on economic and monetary union. Although last week's announcement of a fall in the annual rate of retail price infla- tion to 4.7 per cent in August was \"very encouraging\", there is more to be done. \"My aim is to get inflation down to that of the best-performing countries in the Community. If we want to be a major economic player, we must have a rate of infla- tion comparable with theirs.\" The sharp drop in the infla- tion rate from last year's peak of nearly 11 per cent has turned out to be a boon for the UK in the negotiations on Emu. The draft proposals put forward recently by the EC's Dutch presidency have stressed the importance of con- vergence of inflation and inter- est rates in determining the eli- gibility of countries to move to full union in the final, third stage of Emu. \"The Dutch proposals have demonstrated moves by other countries very much towards our own way of thinking,\" Mr Lamont says. Britain's aim regarding Emu remains \"that there should be no imposition of a single currency and that it should above all be evolution- ary. And on that point the emergence of the criterion of convergence as a key point in the negotiations is very much in line with our own wishes and objectives.\" Britain's \"own way of think ing is not designed - I very much want to emphasise - to wreck, stall or put anybody in a difficult position,\" he insists. \"'e want whatever stage three consists of to be the...most practical and the most sensible blueprint.\" Mr Lamont underlines that the negotiations on Emu are far from over. \"We are a long way from getting an agreement yet,\" he says. There are \"very many difficult decisions still to be made and many difficul: areas to be covered\" between now and the European summit in Maastricht in December. But his policies should soor allow Britain to be among the countries able to contemplate early membership of Emu. noes this and his co-operative approach to the negotiations mean that one of the cabinet-s most prominent Euro-sceptics is undergoing conversion? Mr Lamont hesitates and chuckles. \"Hardly... I think that would be a most unlikely thing to happen.",

   "text_content" : "SIast week in Paris the long-running European antagonism between the federalists and the anti-federal- ists was jerked to life again by contradictory declarations by France and Britain. On Wednesday, President Mitter- rand insisted that the Commu- nity's top priority must be the completion this year of new treaties on economic and politi- cal union; the Community must not disintegrate into a vast free trade area, he said. The next day Mr John Maj-r urged that the EC should immediately adopt a compre- hensive open-door policy for the eventual admission of all European countries able and willing to meet the political and economic conditions. It should not adopt new internal policies, he said, which might make it more difficult cr potential candidates to Joh.

He is strengthening his credentials as a creative world statesman, and he is playing on the average Briton's instinctive scepticism towards the inteationist tendencies of the European Community. No doubt Mr Major shares that instinctive cepticism. But it is a racing rtainty that he will not sacrifice multidimen- aonal British interests on the altar of some abstract doctrine about the shape of Europe. The bottom line is that Britain has no option but to keep in step with its main west European partners. Right now, a large majority of the other Community states, including all the most important, are ltlcaily committed to take a step d in Community integration in the current treaty negotiations. Unless some crisis explodes, that adority is likely to insist at the and of the year on a new treaty or treaties.

But in opera- tional terms they are empty shells: the only thing which has real political life in the new Europe is the EC, and that is why everyone wants to join. The act that the countries of eastern Europe want to join does not, however, give them a right to join. To argue as Mr Mafor does, that the Commu- nity's over-riding obligation is not the interests of its existing members, but the interests of non-members, is simply batty. That is not a principle followed by the British Conservative party, the British government or any other constituted body. The most one can say, is that the Community should have a reaWnk regard for the inter- ts of other Buropean coun- tries, but no more.

   "text_content" : "he1: Senate confirmation T hearings for Judge Cmi- Sence Thomas, Preident Beorge Bush's nominee for the upreme Court, are making g pping television. The splt tween a Republican White House and a Democrat-con- roalled Senate turns any confi- mation hearing into a public du between the litical par ties. But these hearings are unusually charged. A decade of Republican appointments has hifted the court sharply to the right, to the point where it may be in danger of losing touch with public opinion. Many fear the court may soon strike down the important Roe v Wade decision, which estab- ished a woman's legal right to an abortion. Mr Thomas is a black conser- vative who held high office in the Reagan administration. For many liberal (left-wing) Americans, the phrase \"black conservative\" is profoundly contradictory. Mr Thomas, born in abject poverty in Geor- gin, embodies the American dream of betterment through hard work and personal endea- vour. Yet, but for the affirma tive action policies championed by his political opponents, he would not have attended Yale Law School nor attained his present eminence. The irony, however, runs deeper. Mr Bush has spoken strongly against the policy of establish- ing hiring quotas - intended to promote the employment of minorities even when better qualified whites are available. Yet in nominating Mr Thomas for the court he has relied on quota logic. Mr Thomas, who was only appointed an appeals court judge last year and has little practical experience as a lawyer, was chosen in prefer- ence to hundreds of better qualified whites largely because Mr Bush saw the need for diversity. Mr Thomas, if confirmed, will take the seat of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the legendary black civil rights lawyer. The irony is that Dem- ocrats, who believe in prefer- ences for minorities, are suspi- cious of his political beliefs. Republicans support him but logically ought to argue that the job should go to someone better qualified. With the benefit of intensive MICHAELPROWSE on America White House coaching, Mr Thomas is making a reason- able fist of the confirmation hearings. He comes across as decent and intelligent. Indeed he is a good deal more impres- sive than some of the senators cross-examining him. He has refused to be drawn on abor- tion and has attempted to dis- tance himself from extreme stances he adopted in numer- ous speeches and articles dur- ing the 1980s. The result is a credibillty gap but not one that appears large enough to pre- vent his confirmation. Mr Thomas's conservative views are distasteful to many Democrats and most of the important pressure groups rep- resenting minorities. But he does accurately represent a strand of black opinion that may grow more powerful in coming decades. One way of appreciating this point of view is to read The Character of Our Race (Harper Perennial, 1991), a persuasively argued analysis of racial issues by Mr Shelby Steele. Mr Steele is a professor of literature in California, but his life story parallels that of Mr Thomas. Like the Supreme Court nominee, he is black, married to a white woman and resides in a predominantly white middle class neighbour- hood. Like Mr Thomas, he is a member of an expanding black professional class. Like Mr Thomas, he overcame the dis- advantages of poverty and early discrimination. Like Mr Thomas, he has no sympathy for policies which strive to compensate for past discrimi- nation by giving minorities special advantages today. He does not dispute the achieve. ments of the civil rights activ- ists of the 1960s, but be argues that times have changed. He says the biggest obstacle to black advancement lW not lack of opportunity but blacks' lack of belief in themselves. Affirmative action policies have perverse effects because they solidify blacks in their historical rotle of victim while underlining white superiority. Blacks should stop relying on collective action by pressure groups and accept more per- sonal responsibility for better- ing themselves. Government, meanwhile, should concentrate on vigorously penalising dis- crimination and improving educational opportunities for minorities. The criteria for spe- cial assistance should be based, not on the colour of people's skins, but on measures of eco- nomic and social deprivation. Mr Thomas's testimony sug- gests similar views. In the 1990s, he is a credible role model for young blacks even if his opinions depart radically from those of liberal activists such as the Rev Jesse Jackson. One way or another, Mr Bush will ensure that a conservative is appointed to the Supreme Court - and probably one who opposes abortion. Given this reality, Mr Thomas may not be the worst possible choice. However, behind these argu- ments lies a more fundamental issue: the fitness of the rules governing the appointment and tenure of Supreme Court justices. The anxiety which many Americans feel about how the court may rule on the abortion issue reflects the appointments policy of Repub- lican presidents who have con- trolled the White House for so long. In Congress, big Demo- crat majorities are evidence that the public's political loyal- ties are split. It would seem reasonable that these divisions ought to be reflected in a bet- ter balanced court. The problem could also be alleviated if the lifetime tenure of justices was abolished. Lengthy but fixed terms - say 10 to 15 years - would ensure faster turnover and keep the court in touch with changing public opinion. Judge Thomas is only 43; he could be still adjudicating cases in 2031.",

   "text_content" : "party's traditional monopoly on. power coming under challenge and questions ,whether the scope of the new measures is broad enough to pull the country out of its troubles s india Oetters an era of unprecedented .economic change, David Housego finds the ruling Congress INDIA during the past 12 months has passed through what has probably been its most momentous period since independence. The economic reforms introduced by the new Congress administration of prime minister PV Narasimha Rao go further than any previ- ous deregulation measures towards integrating into the world economy what has been a highly protectionist country. Reforms were precipitated by India's coming close to default earlier this year on repayments of its foreign debt - a shock to national pride that itself reflected the failure of the doctrines of self reliance and central planning that have guided economic management over the past 40 years. The Congress party, which has had an almost uninter- rupted monopoly of power since independence, has come under challenge as the natural party of government from a Hindu militant movement, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP now controls three north Indian states - includ- ing Uttar Pradesh, the largest - and is the main Opposition party in the Parliament. Its success in the June general elections - riding on the back of several months of Hindu- Moslem violence in north India - reflects widespread disillu- sion with Congress rule and the appeal of its alternative vision of India as a Hindu state. The assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister and leader of the Con- gress party, by extremist Tam- ils from Sri Lanka, brought at least a temporary end to the domination of India by the Nehru family. It has left the Congress party without a national symbol around which to rally, divided over the long term leadership of the party, and uncertain over which direction to follow. Its confusion reflects the frag- mentation of the centre ground of Indian politics. The collapse of the Soviet Union - India's leading ally - has removed a cornerstone of Indian foreign policy which has traditionally looked to the Soviet Union as a counter- weight to US influence in the world. It is also bound to give an impetus to India's own sepa- ratist and regional movements which see in the example of the Russian Republics a model for their own campaigns for independence or autonomy. Many of the ideas and insti- tutions that have moulded to relomn, Du *wn may nor pwrnu me uieury Umuwm u that he and many sntor Indian offcals would prefer India since independence - the Nehru framework of self-re- liance, socialism, central plan- ning, secularism and the Con- gress party - seem under attack or no longer relevant. Political parties are still unwilling to espouse the alter- natives of market economics, and of an Indian union refor- mulated to make a virtue out of giving more autonomy to the states. But these are likely to be the fundamental tenets of a successful centrist party seeking to achieve higher rates of economic growth. By comparison with the eco nomic reforms in East Europe - or. the more ambitious restructuring undertaken by Indonesia - the policies adopted in India seem modest. They include a programme of iscal and balance of payments itabilisation: the removal of maost industrial licensing; the lifting of restrictions on the further growth of large compa- nies; trade deregulation: and further encouragement to for- eign investment. The measures mark a funda- mental shift in direction - away from an environment where the main focus of busi- ness strategy was on obtaining licences to one where increas- ingly competition will deter- miine which firms succeed. The measures give compa- nies a new freedom to expand capacity to achieve high vol- ume production, to diversify into other products and to grow through mergers and acquisitions. For aggressive, well managed or financially strong groups, they provide tremendous opportunities. More vulnerable ones fear they will not survive. In this sense the reforms mark a turn- ing point in a country where \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t capitalism and profit have long been regarded as distasteful. The shift in direction was announced against the back- ground of a virtual halt to com- mercial lending to India by international banks because of fears that India might default on debt repayments. The exter- nal situation still remains frag- ile. Foreign exchange reserves are low - although India should soon start drawing on a new $2.3bn standby credit from the International Monetary Fund which is due for approval by the board of the Fund. India still is not able to count on automatically rolling over its short term debts. It will need over $9bn this sinan- cial year in fresh funds from the multilateral institutions, donor nations and commercial banks in order to finance its current account deficit as well as loan repayments on its out- mdiing $fbn forenign debt However, the institutions and the banks believe that faI more radical measures are needed to improve export per formance in an economy that generally suffers from high costs, low productivity and poor quality. Mr Michel Cam- dessus, the managing director of the IMF, recently told an Indian newspaper that \"the support of the international community is quite dependent on the boldness and determina- tion of your national efforts\". The type of measures they are pressing for include a sub- stantial reduction in high domestic tariff rates which make it more profitable for industry to produce for the domestic market than for exports; cuts in the labour force in the heavily overman- ned public sector, the phasina out of government directed lending in the banking sector and AIckeased oautonomy for public sector companies and nationalised banks as a pre- lide to privatisatiol. It s hard to see how sectors such as telecommunications, banking, steel, canrs and elec- tronics wll be made interna- tionally competitive without subtiauil Inflows of foreign capital and technology. But ssicgions of foreign multina- tionals still remain. The confidence of the inter- national financial markets in India will not fully return until the government is heading fur- ther down the path of relorm. The best guarantee of main- taining the momentum would be for India to seek - and Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has said that this is his intention - a further three year loan from the IMF under the extended fund facility. This would provide $5-7bn over the period and closer monitoring of the Indian economy. Although Dr Singh and some of his colleagues are aware that the new measures are the first step in a long haul, many in the government and the Congress party are half hearted in their support. Experience elsewhere sug- gests that where an IMF restructuring programme is carried through with the full backing of an administration - as in Indonesia - it stands more chance of success. In India's case the main threat to macroeconomic management comes of an inflationary spiral getting out of control - with a devaluation fuelling inflation that leads to further deprecia- tion of the currency. At 70, Mr Narasimha Rao seems an elderly figure to be leading his country through a period of tumultuous change. He has proved a stronger and more clear-headed Prime Min- ister than many had expected. But as the head of a minority administration he remains politically vulnerable. His own instincts for cau- tious change came through in comments he made immedi- ately after the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev - seem- ingly warning that it showed the risks of hasty reform. But the pressure of events may not allow the more leisurely time- table that he and many senior Indian officials would prefer.",

   "text_content" : "K K Sharma finds the Congress facing a formidable oposition MR P VPaAaOinha:Bao, who heads the nminotit Congress government in I.ndia, is an apparently phlegmatic prime minister ,who, has Ishown remarkably alacrity in initi- ating urgently needed eco- nomic reforms in the few weeks during which he has been in power. He has done this without forming a coalition and with only occasional consultations with the opposition parties, which together outnumber the Congress members and their allies in parliament. National elections earlier this year, the third in just over two years, have led to hung parliament. With Mr Rajiv Gandhi having been assassi- nated in the middle of the elec- tion, the Congress has emerged as the single largest party but with its leadership issue only temporarily resolved. Political instability is inher- ent in the situation. This could be prolonged as rival parties contend for power at a time when no single party can hope for a majority. For the present, the Con- gress is faced with a formida- ble, if divided, opposition which has strong segments that aspire to replace it in the next elections, whenever these might come. The threat to the faction-rid- den Congress - which Mr Rao has so far unsuccessfully tried to weld together after becom- ing the consensus choice of its leader as an elder statesman - comes mainly from the Hindu- revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This now has as many as 117 members in the Lok Sabba, the lower house of parliament, in contrast to the nominal two members it was represented by when Mr Gandhi was Prime Minister. The BJP already forms the governments in four northern states, including the political- ly-important Uttar Pradest, and thus controls large seg- *ments of the Hindi heartland. Its rapid accretion of strength brings to the fore a new force with strong, publicly announced policies of Hindu nationalism that many Indians find attractive. The BJP is now the official opposition, promoting itself as the alternative to the Congress, eager to gain respectability by playing an effective role both in parliament and outside. However, its performance in the states it controls has detracted from its image of a disciplined force and it still carries the stigma - Itafolow- ers would say appeal - of lead- ing a bloody mass moVement on the issue of demolis4hig a Moslem shine in Ayodhys. But its fevered cadre have Mr Rao Is weaki d also by the fiat that the Congress stillI rkhlen with factions allowed the BJP to act as an effective opposition, at least in parliament. As the party has shown in the past, even the moderates within it will not find it easy to compromise on many issues on which it has taken extreme views publicly The threat to Mr Rao is stron- gest from the BJP. Mr Rao is weakened also by the fact that the Congress, as it has emerged in the post Gandhi era, is still ridden witn factions and continues a barely hidden tussle for the leader ship. Many of its members still yearn for the umbrella of the Gandhi family and there is considerable pressure on Mr Gapdhi' siwdow. the ::talini bmn Sonia, to take her hu. bailr's olace .. aMet in Si e ubrc ti. antI 0thwi.In the *ihrty .ll C Woulfyfsoafty b to her t=m.

As a Communist member said: \"The people will stone us if we ask for their votes ain.\" For the time being, Mr Rao is also protectedby the consen- ss among al parties that con- certed action is needed to tackle the economic crisis. Yet they have differed on some crucial issues - such as with- drawal of the fertiliser subsidy - and the government has been forced to compromise to save Itself. It is possible to visualise a situation when such a compro- mise would be difficult, when one or the other of the opposi- tion groups or, worse, the groups combined, might feel they could not give in on an issue on which they had taken a strong public position or on which they had given commit- ments they felt they could not withdraw. The BJP has already had 0me1 conrontations with the government and it will be even more intractable when it acts on the Ayodbya issue. For the nt however, the BJP is h ingtself back because of the common wish to avoid elec- tions and because of disagree ments with other opp tion groups, notably the National Front-Left combine, whose members are openly critical of the party's coqmunal politics. Indeed, Mr Rao survives from dayto-day, hoping for an increase in his party's numeri- cal strength by the not unlikely break up of such par- ties as Mr V P Sngh's Janata Dal - the dominant partner in the National Front - which is torn by Internal dissensions and personal rivalries. Clearly, this is a fragile basis for the kind of strong government that India now needs.",

   "text_content" : "I David Housego finds the benefits of the changes will take several years to be felt AFItER coming close to default on its foreign debt repayments earlier this year, India under its new government has embarked on a programme of macroeconomic stabilisation and of wide ranging structural reforms which are aimed at improving industrial competi- tiveness. The measures still fall well short of what is necessary to bring about a substantial improvement in India's eco- nomic performance - and the real benefits will take two to three years to be felt. Over tne short term, the government faces an uncomfortable period of high inflation, sagging out put and a fragile balance of payments that will test its determination to stick to the policies. Public opinion has been ill prepared that change is bound to be painful. If the measures are to work, substantial cuts will be needed in the labour force of the public sector and the nationalised banks. One of the first actions of Dri Manmohan Singh, the new finance minister, was a bold 18 per cent devaluation of the rupee intended to halt a flight of short term capital and to provide a more competitive exchange rate. The delayed budget that hn announced in July reduced the fiscal deficit from 9 per cent of ross domestic product in the mancial year 1990-91 to a planned 6.5 per cent this year. A cumulative fiscal deficit averaging more than 8 per cent of GDP over the past six years has been the principal factor behind growing inflationary and balance of payments strains. The finance minister has also said that the the deficit would be brought down to between 5 and 5.5 per cent of GDP in next year's budget. These stabilisation measures have been accompanied by a relaxation of tariff and trade controls and a further liberalls- ation of foreign investment. But many of the big struc tural reforms - cuts in protec- tive tariffs where India has rates a mong the highest in the 1mr mukmm urtm Wh Inflation _I_______I world, using market mecha- nisms to allocate bank credit, providing autonomy for public sector banks and industries, and reducing the public sector work force - have yet to be carried out. The International Monetary Fund - which provided rapid balance of payments assistance to India earlier this year - and the World Bank are expected to back these reforms with fur- ther loans. Approval for a fur- ther $2.3bn IMF stand-by credit and a $500m World Bank struc- tural adjustment loan is expec- ted in the coming weeks. Dr Singh also told the Sinan- cial Times that India would apply for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) loan from the IMF. This could provide India with a much needed cushion of a further $5-7bn over three years. But the loan is accompanied by much tighter monitoring of the Indian economy, that would provide some guarantee to India's external creditors that the momentum of reform would be maintained. Because of this, there is still resistance to it within the government and the Congress party. An announcement of the opening of negotiations with the IMF on an EFF borrowing would, more than any other measure, help boost confidence in India on the international financial markets. Since fears of default earlier this year, India continues to be placed in a risk category by the big US and Japanese credit rat- ing agencies. It cannot count on automatically rolling over short-term credits of about $4bn. Important Indian public sector borrowers still reckon it will be several months before they are able to borrow com- mercially abroad at non-pro- hibitive rates. The foreign exchange reserves have been boosted by sales of gold and will be fur- ther boosted by the first tranche of the new IMF loan. Many of the big atructural refornu have yet to be carried out But they provide little room for manoeuvre. The government hopes to cut the current account deficit - calculated on the World Bank definition which includes interest pay- ments on Non-Resident Depos- its - to $6bn from $10bn in 1990-1991. But principal repayments on outstanding loans will add a further burden of $3.2bn. India has an outstanding debt of over $70bn. This requirement of a capital inflow of over 91bn in the cur- rent financial year will be diffi- cult to realise. Normal aid flows from multilateral institu- tions and bilateral donors will rovide about $5.5bn. Fresh foreign investment could account for a further $200m.

Domestically the biggest test of the government's macroeco- nomic policy - and thus the Diggest threat to confidence abroad - will be its ability to curb inflation. As measured by the wholesale price index, the year-on-year inflation rate rose in August to 15.2 per cent as against 7.7 per cent a year before. Devaluation, import shortages as a result of the for- eign exchange crisis, and the high level of liquidity in the economy are all contributing to accelerating inflation. Through a tight money pol- icy, the government's aim is tc bring the inflation rate down to 9 per cent by March. In sup uort of this, the Reserve Bank has reduced its target for the gowth in the money supply from 14 per cent last year to 13 per cent this year. But the gov- ernment also has to hold the line against public sector wage increases. The risk remains that India will find it difficult to break free of the cycle of devaluation fuelling inflation and hence further depreciation that has knocked IMF programmes on the rails in other countries. Another danger is that industrial restructuring will be jeopardised by the shortage of foreign exchange and of imports. As a result of restrictions imposed earlier this year, imports of capital equipment and components have been drastically curbed in recently. Mr S Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank, says he wants to relax them, but not before the foreign exchange reserves have reached a \"reasonable and sus- ficient level\". This could be delayed by the unexpected tumble of exports in the first quarter of the financial year. They fell 6.6 per cent in dollar terms as against the same quarter in 1990. The squeeze on imports, the cuts in government expendi- ture and higher interest rates are all pointing to a slowdown in economic growth. The most visible sign of this at the moment is the drop in fixed capital investment. Industrial- ists are also holding back on fresh outlays of capital because of uncertainty over the impact of reforms and over what tariff cuts to expect. Industrial output is still being buoyed up by the strength of rural demand. Farmers' incomes have bene- sited from four good monsoons and concessions such as the waiving of rural debt last year. But some industrialists believe that industrial growth could drop to 4 per cent - bringing the growth in real gross domes- tic product to below the 3 per cent increase being forecast by the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank).",

   "text_content" : "A NUMBER of - recent developments have sent alarm bells ringing among the hawks in India's armed forces and the ministry of defence. A financial crunch has forced the government to cut expenditure on defence in,real terms, the Soviet Union - India's main supplier of sophis- ticated weaponry - is going through an internal upheaval and the recent Gulf war has shown that the three services are in need of modernisation. The reappraisal that these events have prompted has caused contradictory pulls. The chiefs of the three services have made strong cases for acquisition of new weapons, arguing that defence prepared- ness cannot be sacrificed with- out harming national interests. This has come at a time when the government is mak- ing studies to reduce expendi- ture and is, in fact, examining recommendations of a high power committee that recently scrutinised India's defence pre- paredness. This has recom- mended changes in the context of the country's new security environment. The committee's recommen- dations will probably never be made public but they are said to be in line with the school of thought that favours a restructuring of the armed forces, making them more effi- cient while accepting that cuts in expenditure are inevitable as part of India's economic reforms. The main argument of the doves, or those who believe that India must take current realities into account while planning its defence needs, is that the threats on the border have changed in recent years. They maintain that the Sino- Indian border does not need the same degree of protection that led to a massive increase in defence expenditure for more than two decades after the bitter and bloody war of 1962. That this lesson is being accepted by the country's defence planners is borne out by the fact that the forces deployed on the Himalayan borders in the north-east were recently reduced by three divi- sions which were sent to Kash- mir - reinforcing the widely- accepted belief that India's main adversary remains Pakis- tan, not China. This, by itself, has not A soldier In Kahmr: -Most aseep trat t main adversary Is Pakitan, not Chin reduced overall defence expen- diture but has strengthened the arguments of those who believe that the days of free spending on the armed forces are over and a more realistic approach is necessary. This approach has already been reflected in decisions such as abandonning the plan to buy a third, and highly expensive, aircraft carrier or not adding to the existing sub- marine fleet. There are also clear signs that the programme to develop the army's armoured fire-power is being pruned. The budget presented in July places defence expenditure in 1991-92 at Rsl63bn which, tak- ing inflation into account, makes for a reduction of around 8 per cent over the pre- vious year in real terms. How- ever, unlike the attempt by Mr Rajiv Gandhi during the end of his prime ministership to make an across-the-board cut, the reduction is to be applied unevenly. Details are not being announced for obvious reasons but clearly the chiefs of the three services are not happy at the decision. They argue that cuts should be on the basis of a position of confidence, as part of an overall agreement with Pakistan and China. This is nowhere on the horizon, although bilateral talks with China have led to on-the- ground steps to reduce the pos- sibility of clashes on the bor- der. That India's defence expendi- ture is well beyond its means, particularly at a time of the current financial stringency, is clear from the fact that it has been a high 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product (or even 5 per cent, if the outlays on the related felds of atomic energy and space are taken into account). Much of this is accounted for by imports of hardware. Although the defence import bill is also a closely-guarded secret, analysts have estimated this at variously at $2.85bn to $10.3bn a year in the past five years. This has increased the stri- king abilities of the three ser- vices with the acquisition of more tanks, artillery and ships 'together with re-equipment with modern high-performance aircraft and upgrading of air defence infrastructure. IAccompanying this is the ris- ingunitcosts weapons. The cuts will mean smaller imports although this does not neces- sarily mean that purchases from western sources will be the most greatly affected. This is because supplies from the Soviet Union, the cheapest because they involved payment in rupees and on low credit terms, have become uncertain. As it is, some analysts fear that the erratic supply of spares will soon make a consid- erable part of Soviet-supplied hardware useless for opera- tional use. The case of the hawks has been strengthened by the recent Gulf war and the ease with which sophisticated elec- tronics neutralised Iraq's air force. Their case for expensive equipment to counter this is being met with the argument that in the future they need to deal only with Pakistan's lim- ited capabilities and these have already been reduced because of the cuts in US aid. Yet the question of the reduction in defence expendi- ture, if only because of India's current financial difficulties and pressure from the interna- tional lending agencies, remains difficult because of the problem of identifying the areas where cuts could be applied. If Soviet-acquired weaponry is no longer reliable until sup- plies of hardware and spares again become assured, capital expenditure will need to be increased, rather than to be allowed to fall. At least part of the replacement costs will -have to be on imports from western sources, particularly because of the slow progress of India's efforts'to develop its own weaponry (projects such as the development of a main battle tank and an indigenous light combat aircraft have made notoriously slow prog- ress at a high cost). The answer seems to lie in cuts in manpower since, if it is accepted that China is no lon- ger the threat it was, an army of over a million strong - the fourth largest in the world - is an unnecessary extrava- gance. A redeployment of forces could achieve much more within the new financial parameters. K K Sharma New Delhi",

   "text_content" : "MR S Venkitaramanan had a baptism of fire as governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank. Shortly after he was appointed earlier this year by former prime minister, Mr Chandra Shekhar, India's long- running balance of payments problems escalated into crisis as its foreign exchange reserves fell to dangerously low levels. There was a grave risk that the country would be unable to meet its day-to-day needs for foreign exchange, and that it would therefore have to default, creating a debt crisis similar to that suffered by many Latin American coun- tries in the 1980s. The new central bank chief played a key role in overcom- ing the crisis. He quietly gave firm undertakings to leading foreign central and commercial banks that India would not default, and he took emergency measures to meet the need for cash. These included sales and pledges of gold. Indian banks no longer appear to have day-today diffi- culties in rolling over their short-term credit lines in the international money markets. With the immediate criis over, Mr Venkitarammanan hs been able to turn to the pressing structural problas of the Indian banking industry.

He proceeded into central government, and held the top civil servant posts in both the commerce and finance ministries. He left office at the fall of the govern- ment of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, and re-emerged this year. Will he take a more indepen- dent approach? \"Autonomy and independence are two dif- ferent things,\" he says. \"Autonomy of operations is a totally desirable goal. But in the Reserve Bank of India, you cannot be independent of the central government of the country in taking decisions which affect the economic well-being of the people.\" Mr Venkitaramanan plans to withdraw the Reserve Bank's representatives from the boards of nationalised banks - although the government rep- resentatives will stay. He will not be drawn on the role of the large banking department within the finance ministry - and whether it should be abolished - but sim- ply points out that the govern- ment has an interest as owner of the banks. The area in which the Reserve Bank's role is unques- tioned is in bank supervision.

   "text_content" : "INDIA'S banksl are facing a reversal of the socialist 9hilcs- ophy which has guided thei= business for maore than 20 years. Since Mrs Indira Gandhi began their nationalisation in 1969, banks have been used as instruments of government policy to redistribute resources to rural areas and public sector industry, as well as to help fund the budget defcit throwm the chanfllngo a large pro portion of their, deposits into lending to the goverment. Although the policy achieved many of its goals - especilHy by spreading banking services throughout the country's vil- lages - it also created a mono- lithic, overstaffed, bureaucra- tised and inefficient banking industry with no competition, a distorted interest rate struc- ture, poor loan portfolios, weak profitability, and a severely eroded capital base. The government recognises that reforms of the banks are an essential underpinning to its the liberalisation of the economy upon which it has embarked. But there are few easy options. The key test of will- ingness to tackle banks' pron- lems head-on will come in November when a committee of the country's top bankers and oficials, appointed by the government, submits its recommendations. Commitment to a credible reform programme would win a $500m loan from the World Bank, now under discussion, specifically to support the financial sector. The committee's broad terms of references cover the effi- ciency, accountability, profit- ability, modernisation, comp- tition, capital structure, supervision and legislative framework of banks, as well as their role relative to other financial institutions. They make no specific reference to perhaps the most sensitive issue, privatisation. The possibility that banks will be privatised is already stirring the banks' enormous, uniounsed sta B into indul t Ri action, although a one-id strike planned for September a as calledoff after .pat overnmuent statendats it Osd no plans toprivatie thei. Dr Manmohan Singh, unance minister, say: \"We have no intention to private existing nationalised banks... we want more competition in our banking industry but that does not necessarilyean that you must privatise existing nationallsed banks.' Mr S Venkitaramanan, gov- ernor of the Reserve Bank of India (the central bank), which oversees the banking system, says that there are a number of ways with which to increase banks' capital base without pri- vatisation, \"even when there is complete public sector orienta- tion, capital can be enhanced\", he says. He is especially attracted by the means used for Frencn state-owned banks - which included non-voting stock - and has also suggested that other public sector entities, as important users of banking ser- vices, subscribe to stakes in anksa. However, it is unlikely that any prudent investor would agree to fund a capital restructuring of the banks in their current state without being assured of the commit- ment of government, bureau- crats, and the banks them- selves to radical reform. Mr M N Goiporia, chairman of the State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, is clear that India cannot simply aban- don the concept of \"social banking\" which lay behind nationalisation and the subse- ouent direction of the banks. \"The gains that have been made as a result of nationalisa- tion cannot be frittered away,\" he says. Through the expansion or branches - the banking sys- tem as a whole has some 58,000 throughout India - Mr Goipo- ria says that \"a serious social need has been met\". But he acknowledges that \"the time han come for consolidatior, to 1 rut the emphasis on profitabil- ity and productivity and the commercial aspects of bank- ing\". The first issue which reform- ers will need to address is the extraordinarily high propor- tion of banks' deposits - cur- -ently totalling more than 58 -er cent - which they must set aside for the government's They must place 38 per cent of their depoedits in government bonds and other eligible instru- ments as a \"statutory liquidity ratio\", and have cash reserve requirements under which they must place 15 per cent of heir deposits with the central bank as well as 10 per cent of the incremental growth in their deposits. The return earned by banks on this money is break-even at best. However, forcing the govern- ment to pay more for its money - either by reducing the proportion of banks equired investments or rais- iag their yields - would only Increase the fiscal deficit, which the requirements help to fund. Therefore, the govern- ment is adamant that it cannot alter the statutory liquidity ratio until the budget deficit starts to fall, as it is targetted to do this year. Mr Venkitaramanan says: \"There is agreement that the banks' rofitablitv will depend on whether we can allow them more free play with their money and less pre-emption for government requirements. That can happen the moment the deficit starts coming dIwim\" Secondly, banks need greater freedom in lending. They are required to make 40 per cent of their advances to so-called pri- ority sectors, essentially agri culture and small industry, a: subsidised interest rates. The need for such support has con siderably diminished. Banks have also been directed to forgive loans - for example under a recent scheme when farmers' loans of up to RslO,000 were waived, damaging farmers' creditwor thiness, reducing loan recov- eries because of expectations of ftrther waivers, and weaken- ing banks financial state. Banks often have non-per- forming loans out to effectively bankrupt industrial companies but are expected to advance new money to keep them oper- ating. Their loan portfolios are thus in poor shape. The third need is for banks to compete with each other, as well as with other types of financial institutions, in every field. Until recently, banks' customers were not allowed even to change their bank, and there was no competition on interest rates. Specialised developmental financial institutions, also state-owned, have handled all longer term lending and have developed similar problems because of lack of competition Ltbtenul and weak- There have aready been moves towards g eiatercompe i tton Including the fr-p V some iterst rates. egn banks which comnrise a smal bt dynamic sector of the banking market, provide a -t cmpetitlv atmosphere at the margin. Fourthly, nationallaed banks nsed to shake up managements - imping muh resxater Inde- :iPe~ndeeirom'tbIh of Maurads nDelhiand Bomby -- and to addfress the most politically sensitive issue of al their mas- sive overstaffing and ineffi- ciet systems. Trade unions have blocked significant .modernisation and computerisation, resulting in poor customer service and a lac information for man- agement about banks' finances. 'The government is treading softly, suggesting that it will not be a question of large redundancies but of re-training and better use of the existing labour force. Computerisation would make it easier to meet final need: for better accounting systems and supervision of banks' far-flung activities. The Reserve Bank plans to beef-up its accounting expertise and inspection procedures, but this wll be meaningless unless the banks themselves have better oversight of their business. If all these reforms are begun, banks are likely to win substantial infusions of new capital, whether from the pub- lic or private sector at home or abroad. Many would find it dif- ficult to remain in business without them. The ultimate aim, a senior official says, is to achieve \"social lending with sound banking\". It is a daunt- ing task.",

   "text_content" : "INDIA is a country with a massive shortage of housing. Hence the concern of housing finance institutions that the momentum of new lending to young families purchasing a house for the first time could be hit by the government's credit squeeze. The institution that has done most to pioneer the concept of mortgages in the country is a private sector organisation, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). Started in 1977 in the face of much scepticism that financial institutions could ever recover mortgage payments, HDFC now runs 350,000 accounts for individual house purchasers. Its success has spurred the state owned banks to establish their own mortgage businesses. Over the past 14 years, hous- ing finance institutions have increased their share of invest- ment in new housing from a meagre one per cent to 15 per cent. But the number of new houses being built each year falls way below demand. Of India's 160m urban population (on the basis of 1981 figures), 32m to 42m live in slums. To meet additional demand, 2m houses will need to be put up each year. At the moment about 300,000 new units are being built annually. HDFC, is mana Deepak Parekh, aims to help young families acquire a house and to increase the stock of housing in the country. A typical client of HDFC is an urban household with a combined income of Ras,000 to 5000 a month. Because land prices are so high in India, the ratio of house prices to incomes is 10:1 as compared with 4:1 in most western econo- mies. India's shortage of housing has been in large part due to government policies since inde- pendence. These have channel- led household savings into so called \"priority\" - from agri- culture to steel mills. In the directed credit system still maintained by the Indian gov- ernment, housing is not treated as a priority. HDFC at its outset ran into problems unfamiliar to build- ing societies or mortgage banks in the west. One was that in India buyers and sellers HDFC has a only a marginal proportion of borrowers who default on payments of a house do not declare the fll price of the transaction as purchasers are expected to pay part of the cost in \"black\" money. HDFC normally finances up to 90 per cent of the agreement price which is on average about two-thirds of the real price. Sceptics doubted whether HDFC would be able to recover interest and princi pal repayments because the recovery rate of nationalised banks on other loans is sc poor. Loan default was implicitly encouraged by the government last year when it waived some a40Obn in farmers' debts. But HDFC has a only a marginal proportion of borrowers who default on payments. Only 0.C0 per cent of clients are more than six months behind in their debt repayments. He says that loan officers are encouraged to work with fami- lies to find ways of making payments in times of difficulty - such as during an industrial strike. HDFC has until recently obtained a third of its resources from foreign cur- rency loans - including bor- rowings from the World Bank and a loan guarantee from US Aid for a borrowing on the US capital markets. The rest has come from term deposits and loans from the financial institutions. In sharp contrast to Britain, where 50 per cent of cash assets are in building societies, Indian hous- ing institutions are forbidden by law from taking deposits of less than 24 months maturity. This year, however, HDFC is finding resources difficult to raise and more costly. The halt that India's foreign exchange crisis has imposed on borrow- ings abroad by Indian institu- tions has robbed it of this source of funds. Domestically it has been hit by the credit squeeze. Thus its average cost of funds has risen from 115 to 13 per cent a year ago to 14.5 to 15 per cent. The immediate effect of this has been to put Its marglns under strains. It fears the br- den on families if it passed on the entire cost of Interest rate increases. HDFC has now taken the initiative in coordin- ating new housing finance schemes with other countries in Asia. The emphasis is on drawing in low-income house- holds. David HouMege New Delhi"

   "text_content" : "BANKS have not been the principalsource for longer- term riance 'In India. This role has been :left to speciallsed development finance institu- tions operating at both state and federal level. Though these were success- ful in channelling long-term funds to industry, their lack of competition with each other and their lending to concerns, which have run into financial troubles, have brought upon them similar weaknesses to those of the banks. At the same time, there are facing increased competition from the banks and the capital markets. If the government-appointed committee considering reforms of the financial sector decides upon a radical overhaul, it would include a shake-up of the term lending institutions. The chairmen of the two larg- est - the Industrial Develop- ment Bank of India (IDBI) and the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICI) - are members of the committee. The third big institution is the Industrial Finance Corpo- ration of India, while the Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India concentrates on what are known in India as \"sick\" industries. In practice, however, the financial institu- tions are a large interlocking network, with IDBI having shareholdings in several of the other large institutions as well as in many state bodies provid- ing term finance. Moreover, the country's main shareholding institu- tions, also state-run - Unit Trust of India, Life Insurance Company and General Insur- ance Corporation of India - are closely involved as pur- chasers of the debt of the insti- tutions. Although the institutions have a reputation as innova- tors and are looking forward to India's more liberalised econ- omy with a degree of dyna- mism - assessing the pros- pects for new markets such as merchant banking - they are saddled with the legacy of their past. Their lending policy has been monolithic. Loans have been arranged through consor- tia, with no question of compe- tition for business. They have used the same procedures, and have not conducted analysis of projects independen tly of each other. Recently, however, the start of deregulation of interest rates, with the government specifying a \"minimum lending rate\", and also introducing more competition into the rais- ing of funds by the institutions themselves, have begun to usher in a new era. They also face pressure to relax their hold on companies because they often can put directors on to the boards of companies they finance. Any restructuring, however, will have to deal with the large proportions of their loans out to sick industries in the public sector. Bankers believe that the institutions' profitability is likely to decline further - although not fatally - as a result of these. For the private sector, the Board for Industrial and Sinan- cial Reconstruction is charged with rehabilitating or closing troubled companies (although it operates under severe con- straints because it can only step in when a company's net worth is completely eroded). However, the government has yet to formulate a so-called \"exit\" policy for public sector companies to determine the conditions in which they should be closed down. Government policy, princi- pally the protection of jobs, has tended to prevent measures which would allow sick compa- nies to adjust themselves or to close. It has also provided an incentive to companies to exag- gerate their problems and to refrain from tackling them. A new \"exit\" policy will be of crucial importance to the lending institutions who have financed these industries and could well determine their lon- ger-term future. Alexander Nicoll"

   "text_content" : "THERE are not many stock markets of which the leading regulator would say of invest- ments in shares: \"Entry, hold- ing and exit are all hazards in this market.\" This is the frank admission of Mr G V Ramak- rishna, chairman of the Securi- ties and Exchange Board of India. The SEBI was formed three years ago as part of a drive to simplify and strengthen regula- tion of India's large capital markets. However, it remains virtually toothless until a bill, now before parliament, is passed to give it statutory reg- ulatory powers as well as responsibilities now held by several other official bodies. It will have a big task. There is a wide gap between the effi- cient, fair, modern and national trading mechanisms which leading practitioners foresee in the future and Indian markets as they exist today. It will be especially important to have sound capi- tal markets as the government seeks a more competitive econ- omy under its reform plans. India's established stock- broking community, faced by widespread criticisms of its practices, is seeking to improve and modernise them. However, it may be too late. A govern- ment-appointed committee, headed by Mr MJPherwani, former chairman of the huge Unit Trust of India, has recom- mended a completely re- vamped national market sys- tem and a new stock exchange in Bombay. Because of an uncertain political situation and delays in authorisation by the Con- troller of Capital Issues, new issues of equity and convert- ible bonds fell sharply in the last financial year. However, large companies such as the Reliance and Tata groups can still raise substantial amounts of money. The country's principal mar- kets are its 19 stock exchanges, of which Bombay is by far the largest, accounting for 65 to 70 per cent of business. Although government securities repre- sent the largest amount of securities issued, there is little trading in them. However, there is active trading of shares, and .this year it has been particularly buoyant with the market rising sharply, often moving against interna- tional trends. Mr Hamendra Kothari, presi- dent of the Bombay Stock Exchange, says the market is taking a long-term view of the prospects for India's private sector in a more decontrolled economy, even though growth in corporate profits is expected to decline this year. Institutions such as govern- ment-run mutual funds - pri- vate mutual funds are planned but not yet allowed - are extremely liquid, and supply of new issues has been limited. However, some bankers believe Indian industry could face a tougher environment when the country's high tariff barriers come down - a process expec- ted to begin next year. It is clear that there is a strong speculative element in the markets. The Bombay exchange recently increased its levels of margin - down-pay- ments as security - to 40 per cent of the value of transac- tions in active stocks, from 25 per cent previously. About 90 per cent of trades are carried forward from one settlement period to another and do not result in delivery. While Bombay dealers engage in this frenetic activity, investors and issuing compa- nies are unhappy. Mr Ramak- rishna says the SEBI receives about 500 complaints per day. These are some of the market's inadequacies: * Liquidity is poor. An inade- quately capitalised jobbing sys- tem creates erratic bid/offered spreads. * New issues are absurdly underpriced - the government sets them. This creates a spec- ulative rush and multiple applications. Prospectuses may tell less than the whole truth. * Insider trading is rife. Mr BURMA Kothari admits that the con- cept is not well understood. Corporate disclosure standards are weak. 0 All systems are Inadequate. The Bombay exchange trades for only two hours a day four or five days a week, but cannot keep trade processing and set- tlement up-to-date. There are mis-matches - disagreements on the details of trades - on 30 to 40 per cent of reported trades. Reported prices and volumes are unreliable. The market is fragmented with inadequate links between exchanges. 0 Delivery of shares is woe- fully bad. Companies can delay transfer of shares to new own- ers as a means of manipulating prices. The Bombay exchange has begun to tackle these problems with a plan to upgrade its tech- nology, introducing screen- based trading for less active stocks, leaving active stocks for open outcry trading. Meanwhile, considerable momentum has built up behind the recommendations of Mr Pherwani's committee, which include a second stock exchange in Bombay provoca- tively called the National Stock Exchange. The committee pro. poses an integrated national stock market system creating much closer links between exchanges through streamlined systems and telecommunica- tions. The new Bombay exchange would deal initially in bonds and medium-sized stocks, to which the committee says the existing exchange has paid no iattention. Mr Pberwani's pUB- lic posture is that this would complement the present exchange, but the proposal has clearly been interpreted as a threat. The Bombay exchange feels that an alternative stock exchange would confuse Inves- tors, particularly abroad, and weaken the liquidity of each .arket. Whoever wins this battle will undoubtedly have, in any case, to fall under atighter sys- tem of regulation as the SEBE takes on its new powers. Although it plans to create an self-regulatory system along the lines of London's structure, with self-regulatory bodies overseen by SEBI as an umbrella, some aspects will be statutory, such as a takeover code. Mr Ramakrishna belleves that the market lacks the self-discipline for voluntary code. The capital markets may therefore be one of the few sec- tors to see tougher regulation, though without too much cumr- bersome bureaucracy, amid the new liberal atmosphere. Mr Ramakrishna says: \"There is call for a great deal of liberaia- ation in some areas, but there is also call for more meaning ful protection of the investor in other armeas.\" Alexander Nicoll",

Public sector loaes and inef ficencies are not only a drain on the budget and push up Iterest rates on the capital market. They a also passed through the economy In terms f higher costs, often poorer ality products and in delays ni delivery. There are, however, wide diffrenceas between the pn-be sector enterprises. The bige losses have been concentrated n coal, stel, heavy enginelaer -ag, fertlisn, shipyards ad textiles. The most profitable comnanies have been the Oil and Nitural Commission (ONGC) and 0l Corporation of India whtich benefit from a vir tld monopoly. ONGC, how- ever, has come under criticism this year for bad mangemen Of wells and for allowing oil exploration to slip. A number of public sector enterprises have a reputation for good management. They nclude Indian Petrochemical Corporation (IPCL), HMT, Bharat Electronics (BEL) Bharat Earth Movers, the National Thermal Power Cor poration (NTPC) and Maruti, the car manufacturer. Public sector corporations also operate with incentives- and constraints that deter Improvements. They have to eek government approval for investments and even for such oenditures as the chairman trvelltng abroad. Like government depart- -ents, they are subject to inspection by the Auditor Gen- eal's department, mI concern Is more on deting aste and performance. Pablic sector units have been Judged by the Supreme Court to be a instru- mest of the state under the constitation. They thus face threats f rocao for vio- lating an' ndividual's fnda- mental rih - for Iastace, by alloc a car out of turn. They benefit on the other hand from purchasing and procurement privileges over the private sector in tendering for contracts from government cthe perived wisdom among politicians and techno- crats in Delhi is that public sector reform can be carried through without privatisation. Mr RC Bhargava, managing director of Marut, disagrees. He says: The only answer Is privatisation. With the consti- tutlon and laws that we have it is not possible for the gov- ernment to distance itself [from public sector compa- nies]. Thus effclent manage- ment Is not possible.\" Mr Bhargav has said that he wants Maruti, in which Suzuki of Japan has a 40 per cent state, to have a majority private shareholding. State owned Industries are still unclear what the govern- ment Intends to do with the public sector and how the measures already announced will affect them. Over recent years they have learnt to depend less on the government for funds and more on their own reserves and the borrow- ngs they can make in the cap- Many have already felt the first stirrings of competition as the private sector has been allowed to compete in areas that were before reserved to public sector companies. But most loss making units will have little chance of returning to poftability until they can ed their labour force. The test of public sector reform will be the govern- ment's \"exit\" policy - and thus the attitude it takes towards redundancies and clo- sures. David Housego",

   "text_content" : "SOMETIMES the expected becomes the unexpected. Before the PVNarasimha Rao administration announced the new industrial policy (NIP) on July 24 this year, most people presumed it would be radical. None foresaw just how revolu- tionary it would be. At one stroke, the 10-page document delicenced, deregu- lated and decontrolled vast chunks of the economy. Reac- tions were extreme. Professor Madhu Dandavate, former Jan- ata Dal finance minister, immediately disparaged the NIP's \"fire brigade approach\". The confederation of engineer- ing industry called it \"out- standing\". Boldly breaking away from the traditional Nehruvian brand of socialism, the NIP clearly enunciated a set of eight objectives which centred round two basic needs. Firstly, to encourage entrepreneurship and usher in new technologies, the government would disman- tle \"redundant excessive con- trols\", develop the capital mar- kets, and abolish monopolies. Secondly, the Indian econ- or needed ;tQ belntegrated wit the rest ofthe worid So instead of \"permittIngW foreign investment, linawowid now. \"welcome\" it I vthe hope that it would \"bringfbtter technol- ogy, expand production and help increase exports\". Fifty days after the event, doubts have begun to creep in. Mr JRD Tata, chairman Emer- itus of India's biggest business house, recently warned fellow businessmen that now \"the pri- vate sector will have to do a considerable amount of self- policing, learn to live with the perils of competition and deny itself the joys of a protected market.\" Pampered for the past four decades, lobbies from the private, public and co-opera- tive sectors are reluctant to heed Mr Tata's advice. They are chipping away at the NIP's edges and with some success. In order to protect its own turf, a politically well-con- nected business house has ensured that the petrochemi- cals sector remains licensed. Despite the broad-banding principle, Telco, a truck manu- facturer is blocked from mak- opposition from litics NIP's implIcations, nor care. The bureaucracy does noi like the NIP because it will reduce the discretionary pow en which civil servants find profitable. Those in the labow force do not want the N-: because they are frightene\" that the winds of competitio may blow their jobs away. \"I only hope that vestei interests will not put pressur on the government to dilutt implementation,\" said Mr Sri chand P Hindujya, head of th $2.1bn Hindujya group, whbi has interests in construction film and engineering. Commitment is limited tc the tiny core of top bureau crats who are spear-headinj the structural reforms. Then is a real fear that these ke3 individuals may be eased oui under pressure. Aware of thf awesorme might of thosE Factory wokerfm The labour force lear job loee against the liberalisation movement, the core group is working overtime to make the NIP irreversible. Gordian knots of red tape are being sliced, bureaucratic procedures simplified and laws brought into line with reality with breath-taking haste. A record number of rules and regulations have already been abolished. Entrepreneurs no longer need cabinet approval for pro- jects. Trade laws are simpler. There is a new takeover code, a new small scale industries pol- icy and a new telecom strat- egy. Bottleneck bodies such as the director general of techni- cal development, the chief con- troller of imports and exports, the export inspection agency and the state trading corpora- tion are either being abolished or reduced in importance. Capital market reforms are being energetically discussed as well as the role of the con- troller of capital issues. Its power will be sharply clipped once the proposal is passed that companies no longer need its approvals for issues under Rs250m. It is widely expected that pivotal acts such as those gov- erning foreign investments (SERA) and monopolies (MRTP) as well as the compa- nies act will be amended shortly. By correcting these Frankensteins, the government will simultaneously force healthy competition and reduce corruption among the bureaucracy. Even if all goes as planned, questions remain. Will busi- nessmen respond to the new opportunities? Can the NIP make India globally competi- tive? Are multinationals truly welcome or is this just dust for World Bank and IMF eyes? What will corporate India look like after five years? The long-term looks just as optimis- tic as the short-term appears pessimistic. The liberalisation program is radical. It will take three - possibly more - years before the benefits are visible. Until then, most economists predict inflation and social unrest, although the good monsoon is a redeeming feature. Clearly, the NIP will quicken the pace of industrial growth, as past experience shows. The limited liberalisation of the 1960s led to an amazing con- sumer surge which in turn fuelled a 10 per cent industrial growth rate. The current reforms should have an even bigger impact, but not immediately. As Mr N Vaghul, chairman of the indus- trial credit and investment cor- poration of India, points out: \"The high cost of money is hit- ting fresh capital investment\". With interest rates of 21 per cent and above, the viability of any projects starting today is uncertain. Most businessmen appear to be holding back on new investment, if they can, until rates come down. Inevitably 'corporate India will look quite different. The composition of the big business houses will change signifi- cantly as operational effi- ciency, marketing and other managerial inputs become more important than political connections. As competition increases, analysts predict many more takeovers and mergers as in the West. The quality of Indian products are expected to improve dramatically although it may not directly lead to India becoming a global opera- tor. Nonetheless, \"companies who export will do far better than those which are basically geared to import-substitution\" says Dr Freddie Mehta, eco- nomic adviser to the Tata group. From this, it is evident that economic liberalisation is today a juggernaut that is impossible to stop. Mr Singh Is more than half-way to fulfilling his dream of going down in history as the man who uncaged the Indian tiger.",

   "text_content" : ":THE sad reality of corporate life in India U* that the moment thae government levels the ind rial playing field by r.iemovin controls, business- en suddenly realise thatthey do not, In a like free and \"air- This point Is becom- ing increaingly visible in almost every sphere of eco- Snomic activity, particularly in the steel sector. \"Lberaliatlon is gdod - but not in my busi- ness,\" is the refrain suddenly being sung by Indian captains of Industry. In Dr Manmohan Singh's brave new world, anyone may now promote an integrated steel plant. On July 24, 1991, the new industrial policy reversed a 41-year-old tradition reserving steel for the public sector. In January, the government received 49 applications from the private sector, all clamour- ing to expand into steel. After July, there was a sudden, curi- ous silence. By August, almost half had backed off abruptly once the ability to raise large sums of money became more important than the cornering of a licence. Nonetheless, if all the remaining paper applications take concrete shape, India could add an incredible 20m tonnes per annum (mtpa) of steel capacty, easing the exist- ing famine considerably. During 1990-91, India pro- duced 13.4mtpa of steel and imported 1.5mtpa. Per capita consumption is 16kg but is sup- ply-determined rather than demand-determined. If iron and steel were freely available, demand would shoot up. According to the planning commission, the demand for finished steel will exceed 19mtpa by 1995. The price tag for the proj- ected capacity is over Rs500bn. However, it is unlikely that local entrepreneurs will be able to raise this kind of money. One consequence of 40 years of tight government controls is that few Indian business groups possess the financial muscle which large industrial complexes need. For example, the cost of a Imtpa crude steel plant is roughly Rs25bn at today's post- devaluation prices. Business- men will thus need sufficient resources to provide for their equity contribution as well as a glamorous reputation among investors to attract support for a long-gestation project. The magic mix should also include the ability to raise for- eign funds and tough manage- rial competence and to be able build an entire township round a lant located In a !siby remote part of India efl tly and costffectively. The Bombry based Tata roup, India's biggest business house, iserhaps the only one to possI all these attributes. the highly diversified 76. comapany group runs the only privately-heldsteel company in the country, Tate Steel, which is currently expanding its existing 2.32mtpa capacity to amtpa. It is one of the few Indian business houses known outside the country. It as a strong management cadre and is mancially well-stacked. Addi- tionally, Mr Russi Mody, Tate Steel's chairman, is confident that some member companies ill pitch in to help him. Al these traits will play a crucial role it, as is widely epected, Tata Steel's proposal for a RslSbn, Imtpa integrated steel plant at Daitari in the state of Orissa is accepted. Of the remaining 20 or so entrepreneurs who also have dreams of steel, four stand a fighting chance: = The Essar group. Last Feb- ruary, it successfully outbid the steel majors for a Rs20bn imtpa crude steel project at Vijaynagar in Karnataka. The group's plus points are managerial competence (it operates the biggest sponge 'ron plant in India), its proven ability to raise large amounts from the capital markets and excellent political connections. it is also a nimble head-hunter and has already drawn the .head of Bhilai Steel into the Vijaynagar project. But it is a relatively small group with sales last year of only RsSObn and has over-sized ambitions. Of greater signifi- cance is the rupee's devalua- tion and inflation. \"We are re- ass-essing the project's cost,\" admits Mr Ravi K Rula, the group's director. Coal linkages culd be another source of anx- iety. 0 Mukand. Operating India's biggest electric arc furnace complex, it wants to integrate backwards through a Rs20bn imtpa crude steel plant in Madhya Pradesh. Managerially competent and with the right political connec- tions, Mukand could probably make a successful domestic mega-Issue and be able (with some difficulty) to put forward the promoter's equity. Nonetheless, Mukand will nave to turn to BajaJ Auto (BA), a sister concern and a scooter manufacturer, for financial help. Exactly how much help Mukand will get is uncertain. Mr Rahul Bajaj, BA's chair- man, is guarded. \"As a Bajaj group company, Mukand's expansion plans will have U port, but it is premature to a about the kind aof support that may be required,\" he says. SGrasim. Mr Aditya Bira's The project has several strong points. Mr Birla has wide experience of erecting large industrial complexes in a timely and cost-effective man- ner. 0 The group einjoys excellent politica connections, is cash- rich and can easily raise funds both locally and internation- ally. It is already running a highly-profitable aluminium company and is in the process of setting up a sponge iron unit. The problem is one of plenty. Most group companies are busy expanding their existing businesses. Grasim, which is, India's second biggest business house has also drawn up ambi- tious blueprints for a total investment of over Rs50bn. Over the next couple of years, the steel plant will have to compete for the management's attention with projects such as an oil refinery, a power plant and new tyre, cement and alu- minium facilities. * Mahindra Ugine. Already operating one of the most effi- cient special steel companies in India, the move into crude steel in Maharashtra will be one of backward integration for the group. Key factors in its favour are engineering experience and a high quality of corporate cul- ture. In common with Mukand, the Mahindra group may find it difficult to raise the pro- moter's contribution. Unlike Mukand however, it appears that the entire group is back- ing the project. One crucial difference between the Mahindra pro- posal and the others is that the group plans to bring in a for- eign collaborator. \"We hope that whoever it is will provide a substantial chunk of the proj- ect's equity,\" says Mr Anand Mahindra, who holds key posi- tions in the RslSbn group's two biggest companies. Clearly, India will increase her steel capacity over the next few years. Equally evident is that government go-aheads are no longer licences to print money as they used to be. Would-be steel barons will need to develop an alloy of entrepreneurial dynamism with a way of tapping into large resources before they can succeed. Gita PIramal Bombay",

Its USIm plant - stone built amid a carefully landscaped tropical garden - is an integrated unit where precision engineers make all parts of a watch from movements to casings from Titan's own designs. The pieces are put together in an assembly shop that is as dust free and clean as a labora- tory. The average age of the work force - all recruited from local village schools after aptitude and attitude tests - is Mr Xerxes Desal, the founder and managing director of Titan, claims: \"We have the competitive advantage of low labour costs and of productiv- ity levels comparable to any- thing in the world.\" Titan is still a minnow oy world standards producing 3m watches a year as compared with the 178m movements manufactured by Citizen, the Japanese manufacturer and the largest watch company in the world.

I has also made a name for itsel by stylish design and aggres -ive marketing to an India- middle class hungry for morn fashionable products. Titan was set up as a join venture between the Tati group and the Tamil Nadu gov ernment to take advantage o the lock of competition in thi Indian watch market. The onl: large producer when the proj Oct was conceived was HMT, the state-owned machine tools company also based in Banga- lore. They produced functional time pieces rather than fashion products. Titan reckons that 20m watches are sold in a year in India - a market growing annually by 2m. But half those sold are smuggled into the country. India forbids the import of watches. Smugglers bring the movements into the country - most often Citizen - and backyard shops make the caslngs. Titan, which now produces 80 models ranging from gold plated presentation pieces to watches fashioned after Swatch watches, has pushed out the smuggled watches in the middle class price bracket of Rs5001500. \"The reason why we succeed in India,\" says Mr Desai \"is that the Indian con- sumer will pay a slightly Shast - uou lttc such jewel 4 fBinuid watches-as w ifu other brands - are t old: by watch repairers albnteetshop6.

For many yeus, Tata, one of the biggest Indian was told that this was a sector reserved for small scale industry.

Titan's aosts are higher than those in Â·HoPg Kong and Japan because t suffers from a 6080 per cent customs duty on imported capi- tal equipment. Mr Desai shifts this cost differential to the watches he sells in the domes- tic market. I\"All government interven- tion which leads to higher costs I shift to the domestic market,\" he says.

   "article_dc_title" : "BEL Hit by Defence Cuts",
   "article_dc_subject" : "article",
   "text_content" : "BHARAT ELECTRONICS (BEL), the diversified electron- ics group with the reputation of being one of India's better managed public sector compa- nies, is in an introspective mood. Government spending on defence - which accounts for 57 per cent of BEL's turnover - has been falling. Expendi- ture cuts and increased excise duties have also hit sales of telecommunications and broad- casting equipment, and of elec- tronic components - all important markets for BEL. Capital spending this year is half as high as in recent years because credit is tight and the government has temporarily banned the import of capital plant from abroad. Also, as a result of the foreign exchange shortage, BEL can only obtain 40 to 50 per cent of the imports of raw materials and compo- nents that it requires. Imported parts are normally the equivalent of 25 per cent of turnover which in 1990-91 reached Rs7.2bn. Mr PD Modak, the newly appointed chairman of the group whose headquarters are at Bangalore, believes in mak- ing the best of the difficult sit- uation. He sees the problems as \"an opportunity more than a threat. They will force us to rely on our own resources. It is better that we don't have soft options any more.\" Mr Modak has thus embarked on a review of BEL's corporate strategy designed to BEL Is a conglomerate that now finds Itself in too many products and too many sectors take advantage of the openings provided by industrial deregu- lation. BEL is a conglomerate that now finds itself in too many products and too many sectors. This is a reflection of its role which was originally conceived as one of making India as self reliant as possible in defence electronics and in communica- lions equipment. BE: was soe up in 1954 but expanded afte. India's war with China in 1962. It now produces radars for civil and military use, weapons guidance systems, microwave transmitters, TV studio equip ment, satellite stations, anten nae, television tubes and a wide range of components. . recent venture was the manu facture of electronic voting machines. But orders by the central government have dried up leaving the assembly line idle. The large growth of turnover in the past 10 years has no been matched by a similar rise in profitability. Profit before tax as a percentage of sales dropped from 15.7 per cent in 1981 to 6.1 per cent in 1990-91 The company says this is in part because defence sales as a proportion of turnover also dropped from 65 per cent at the beginning of the I960s. Mr Modak says that \"obvi- ously defence is the most prof- itable\" part of the business. He says orders are hard to obtain but margins are better and sales less volatile than in the civilian sector. Another legacy of the past for a public sector company that finds great difficulty in shedding labour is that the age of the work force is high. At Bangalore - the oldest and largest plant in the group - the average age of the 12,000 employees is over 40. Mr Modak wants defence to remain BEL's biggest market accounting for 50 per cent of its business. He says this is the government's intention - which means that as a defence contractor it would not be eli- gible for privatisation. Many bankers believe, however, that BEL is one of the companies in which the public could be offered a minority stake. Mr Modak wants to regroup BEL into divisions that would reflect its main business inter- ests. Though he does not admit publicly to the possibility of the state's equity capital being diluted, he is enthusiastic for BEL to be involved in new joint venture subsidiaries with 'The challenges ahead are technological rather than financial or organisational' foreign companies. His biggest proviso is that such ventures should have advantages for BEL in backward integration. Among areas he would like to expand in are IC (integrated circuit) manufacture and medi- cal equipment. Currently BEL's exports are small - only Rs3380m. But Mr Modak sees the need to increase them, if only because under the new system of exim- scrips (instrument linking availability of imports to exports) the import of compo- nents will be closely tied to what the group exports. Mr Modak says he would like to see BEL doing more compo- nent and sub-assembly manu- facture for foreign defence pro- ducers, thus taking advantage of India's lower labour costs. The group recently signed a joint venture to produce image intensifiers for Oldelft. Mr Modak has spent much of his career at BEL in research and development work. He sees the challenges ahead as more technological than financial or organisational. To any defence electronics group, the Gulf war provided a jolt as to the possi- bilities of precision guided weapons. Mr Modak plans to expand R&D work. With the foreign exchange squeeze likely to limit pur- chases by the Indian defence forces of foreign equipment, he sees increased opportunities for BEL as a domestic supplier if it can develop the right prod- ucts.

   "text_content" : "Mr P Chidambaram, the minister of commerce, says that cutting tariff levels to an average of 30per cent would be a desirable objective for India. For a country with one of the highest tariff levels in the world - the average weighted tariff is over 112 per cent - such a reduction would mark a radical shift in policy. But Mr Chidambaram adds a 'The main problem Is not the los of revenue from customs duties but the foreign exchange shortage' note of caution. \"That would be desirable (a 30 per cent tar- iff level). But whether it would be achievable in the medium term is something we have to wait and see.\" He feels that the main prob- lem is not the loss of revenue from customs duties but the foreign exchange shortage. \"If we allow large imports of capi- tal goods that would mean a severe drain on foreign exchange.\" A lawyer from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Mr Chi- dambaram was a junior minis- ter in the Congress govern- ment of Mr Rajiv Gandhi. As a close associate of the former prime minister, he was involved in drawing up the package of economic reforms that went into the Congress party manifesto. When prime minister PVNarasimha Rao formed his government he was angry that he was not given a post in the cabinet - and let his irritation show. Since then, however, he has been one of the ministers most concerned with present- ing the government's reform package. Aged 46, he is self-assured, articulate and ambitious. But his popularity in his native Tamil Nadu has taken a knock- ing after the government was perceived as supporting the neighbouring state of Karna- taka in the dispute over the division of the waters from the Cauvery river. As a result of this dispute his car was stoned when he was on a recent visit to the state and he was injured. As minister of commerce he has had responsibility for the partial delicencing of imports, the introduction of eximscrips - the new instrument that links the volume of imports to the growth of exports - and to new incentives for export zones. The biggest blow to his pol- icy of tariff and import liberal- isation has been the unex- pected drop in exports for the first quarter of this financial year. Exports fell 6.6 per cent in dollar terms in the April-June period as against the same period last year - so reducing foreign exchange receipts. Understandably, he has blamed this on his controversial prede- cessor, Dr Subramanian Swamy. Both by coincidence were at Harvard. Officials say the drop in exports was mostly due to the exceptional curbs on imports imposed to prevent India defaulting on payment of its foreign debt. They expect exports over the current year to grow by a still disappointing 6 per cent in dollar terms - hopefully rising to 18 per cent next year. Mr Chidambaram has been campaigning hard to get the import curbs removed for export industries. Mr Chidambaram believes 'The government will move rapidly to remove obstacles that have blocked foreign Investment proposals' that as a result of the new measures foreign investment will pick-up. He says the gov- ernment will move rapidly to remove obstacles that have blocked important foreign investment proposals. \"We will clear at least a dozen proposals before the year is out,\" he says.",

   "text_content" : "EVERY night, the harsh light from dull orange flames plays eerily over the inky waters of the Indian ocean. Burning Just off Bombay's shore-line, the fierce fire is easily visible from the Gateway of India, a promi- nent landmark. The blaze is actually 8.33 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas being flared daily by the oil and nat- ural gas corporation (ONGC). While tourists stop to gape at the awesome sight, execu- tives of power companies rail at the wanton waste of a scarce natural resource. This flame has been burning since 1978. In total India flares almost 17mcm daily. \"I could have used this gas to solve Bombay's chronic power shortage,\" says Mr P Abraham, who recently resigned as the chairman of the Maharashtra State Electric- ity Board (MSEB). According to MSEB's esti- mates, it can erect a gas-based power plant within eight months and write off the investment within two years. Instead of letting MSEB do that, however, bureaucrats squabble over what to do with the precious gas and how it should be divided between energy, petrochemicals and ser- tilisers. Unfortunately, such spend- thrift apathy is not restricted to the department of petroleum alone. It prevails particularly in the State Electricity Boards (SEB) which control 63 per cent of India's power genera- tion. As of March last year, 13 out of the 17 functioning SEBs had run up losses of over Rs47.85bn. This shows up in India's average plant load factor, which was a paltry 53.8 per cent between April 1990 and March 1991. As a result, power has become an infrastructural bottleneck. According to Mr Kalpnath Rai, energy minister, the total generation from thermal, nuclear and hydro power plants during 1990-91 was 264bn units. What Mr Rai's impressive figures hide is the yawning gap between demand and supply, a gap which is wid- ening each year. The power ministry estimates that there is already an average shortfall At .o serf cent, Which rime to 172 per centin, pea times.

In the centre of Bombay, India's commercial heartland, the city has teetered on the verge of riots twice in three years after grid collapses which crippled the transport system on which over Sm peo- ple depend. Galvanised by the grim future but handicapped by empty coffers, in June last year, the VP Singh administra- tion invited the private sector to generate and distribute power. In July this year, Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress government went a step fur- ther by inviting foreign compa- nies to build power plants in India, either alone or in part- nership with Indian firms. Although the initial response was enthusiastic, interest quickly waned leaving just two important business houses seriously including power in their long-term planning. \"We have identified power as one of two thrust areas for the 1990s,\" says Mr Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, India's fourth largest business house. Over the past five years, the highly diversified group has quietly acquired and pro- moted six companies through which it now controls almost every sector of the industry, from generation to distribu- tion, and transmission towers to cables. mostly iir*Â«Â»ft htlu in Blhar and\" West CBenpol - lectively that trzasl into over 1000mtw of new g' ra. tion and Ra24bn in flh capi- tal investment. The Tata group is the secoid interested group. Through the three Tata electric companies, India's largest business house already operates one of the mist eficient power networks in the country. The Bombay- based group is now actively involved in ett up four new power plants, a1,d is biddmw. for over two others. This could add up to l,45tmw. Even their fervour for power may fade away because of leg- islative apathy. Some 15 months and three prime minis- ters later, the archaic Electric- ity (Supply) Act of 1948 has still not been amended despite open support by almost all lob- bies. On September 9 the much delayed bill was Introduced in parliament, but with just two working days left before this session is over the issue may be carried on into the winter session. Other groups, such as the Birlas, the Ambanis and Video- con who have shown interest in the new policy, are more concerned with improving the quality of energy near their manufacturing facilities than getting into the power business per se. In any case, the private sec- tor does not have the financial muscle to build plants bigger than 500mw. And if there are too many small power stations dotted across the country, they will become stumbling blocks in creating a cost-effective national transmission network. Meanwhile, things are unlikely to improve unless two big problem areas are tackled effectively: subsidies to farm- ers and pilferage. In some states, farmnners get free electricity. In Andhra Pradesh they pay just Rs5 per month. In all states, they pay rates far below urban ones. Ifiasive ubiid'dies to agrc in total energy consumptlo is about 25 per cent. Earlier during the year, at an energy conference called by the prime minister for a1 the state chief ministers, the pwer ministrybluntly asked that the burden of subsidy should be shouldered by the state gov- ernment rather than the SEBs\". It was a harassed reac- tion to curb the tendency of chief ministers of promising free electricity to farmers the moment elections are announced. The SEBs are almost equally badly hit by pilferage. The theft of power is escalatin to intolerable lvels. For example, a recent inquiry conducted by the MSEB revealed that some MSEB officials had colluded with a factory owner to under- bill him by RsSOOm. Such inci- dents are increasingly becom- ing common. Experts suspect that nearly 25bn units are stolen annually. This figure is based on national transmission and dis- tribution (T&D) losses, which in the case of SEBs have climbed from 13 per cent in 1961 to 23 per cent in 1990. According to the centre for monitoring Indian economy, as much as 11 per cent of this is not T&D losses at all but ille- gal tapping. Unless this phenomenon is effectively checked, policies to increase generation will remain a mockery. At the same time, it is clear that load-shed- ding the problem on to the pri- vate sector will not add sub- stantially to capacity. What is needed is that the government action. The first step should be to improve the working of existing facilities. If the average plant load factor increases by just one per cent, 500mw of electricity can be generated without spending one extra rupee. Until politi- cians and civil servants sum- mon up their courage to act immediately, Indians will sim- ply have to get used to dark days and idle factories. Glta PIramal",

   "text_content" : "R Y more than any of the enomy, P dh n-o no~n-9jal~ed; agricultural w kers, unionsed labour a pnts.aifor only about 6 per ent of Ithe oerll workfoceL However, it is powerful and vocal. Many offioais, bankers and industralists believe that the unions, if they so chose, could block the government's efforts to fre up the economy. It . difficult to escape the conclusion that whole-hearted efforts to streamline bureau- cracy and make companies more efficient and competitive - especially if they involved privatisation - would result in considerable paring of man- power. The government is at pres- ent making strenuous efforts to play down the likely effects. And unions, for their part, are adopting a cautious approach. The new industrial policy has therefore, so far, produced lit- tle overt conflict. But a lot will depend on how the dialogue proceeds over the coming months. Until this year, the unions have found themselves in tune with the philosophy, if not always with the execution, of government policy since inde- pendence. There has been strong emphasis on the role of government and thepublic sec tor in meeting social heeds providing employentand subasfisnce for India's masses, and rjfectlng foreign imp eral- ism and stressing the need for the country to be self-suffi- :ient. The. need to avoid sacking people has resulted in many unvlable industrial concerns being kept'in operation. Unions have blocked any sig- nificant cputesaton in the vast nationalised anks with the result that most informa- tion is still on pperprevent- ing proper centralined control of anks' operations and perpe- tuating poor service and mas- sive over-staffing. Public sector employees receive a \"dearness allowance\" to compensate them for inflation. The result has been an uncompetitive economy and an unsustainable budget deficit. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister who is spear- heading the attempt to change the direction of public policy, called together labour leaders last month to explain his mea- sures, provide reassurances about their consequences, and promise full consultation. While emphasising that both the public and private sectors urgently needed to be made more competitive and cost-ef- fective, he also said the govern- ment would ensure that the burden of adjustment did not fall on the working classes. Mr Sngh has specifically ruled out privatisation of banks, thus averting a one-day strike of bank staffs which had been planned for September 6 in anticipation that the govern- ment's plans would involve pri- vatisation. Unions are sceptical, how- ever, about the posibilities for dialogue. Mr Ram Lal Thakur, secretary . of the Indian National Trade Union Con- gress, says: \"There has not been consultation for four to five years. The bureaucracy has the upper hand Ministers call occasional meetings, but they only remember the trade unions when they're in trou- ble. They want to create the impression of good dialogue when they need it.\" Neverthe- less, he feels the meeting with 'The Industrial policy has not uttered one word about generation of now employment' the finance minister was a good beginning and that the union - which as traditionally been aligned with the ruling Congress party - will not adopt a confrontational approach. This spirit of co-operation may not be taken up by all other unions, however. Mr TNSiddhanta, secretary of All- India Trade Union Congress, foresees big reductions in man- power as a result of the new government policies. \"The industrial policy has not uttered one word about genera- tion of new employment,\" he says. The policy - which opened up private sector companies to the possibility of foreign con- trol - has not taken into account the rise in unemploy- ment, the slowing in employ- ment growth, and the fact that India has the third largest technically qualified labour force in the world, Mr Sid- dhanta says. \"India is not Sing- apore, Taiwan or even Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka will be drow- ned in tea if it doesn't export. But we will not be drowned in tea.\" He adds: \"I am not saying that the purpose of production Is only to give employment, but employment has to be taken into account. We think the government is not impervi- ous to protests and views. It is amenable to pressure. It is democratically elected and above all a minority govern- ment.\" Mr George Fernandes, for- mer industry minister under a Janata party government and a leading socialist critic of the government, feels that little serious opposition is being mobilised at present. \"I do not believe the unions are in any sort of fighting shape.\" Mr Ser- nandes is setting up an action committee and calling together union leaders. He feels in par- ticular that an influx of foreign technology will mean wasting investment which has already been made in Indian industry. But he admits: \"At the moment I am truly whistling in the dark.\" Public sector employers, meanwhile, are adopting a con- ciliatory tone. Mr S Venkita- ramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, which oversees the banks, says that in reforming them \"we have to improve the work culture of banks, we have to carry the workers and staff members of banks. The human resource component of banking reform is often neglected. It's a very important component. They are a very important segment of banking reform. They have to be trained, they have to be given proper motivation and they have to have a sense of involvement and participation in the whole system.\" It is not a question, he says, of redundancies, but of using the existing labour force better and retraining. The Reserve Bank has not allowed banks to expand their staffs for some time. \"I do not visualise that as a result of reform there will be a need for getting rid of peo- ple.\" It is clear, however, that hard decisions will have to be taken. Government and busi- ness will both be seeking to maintain dialogue with the unions and to blunt their for- midable potential to derail the new policies.",

The trade policy announced in early August and moves for an open economy are expected to give an impetus to exports from the zone. Devaluation of the rupee by 18 per cent this July will encourage businesses in Santa- cruz Electronics Export Pro- cessing Zone (Seepz) to source their raw material needs locally and official permission to sell a quarter of production in the domestic market at half of the import tariff will boost their profitability.

Exports from Seeps have more than trebled in three years from RsLbn in 198748 (April - March). The growth is projected to slow down this year to Rs4bn.

The zone is yet to attract Japanese multinationals, *hich, up to now, have pre- ferred Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Pacific Rim countries. Seepz has not mar- keted vigorously, as many Far East countries have done. \"The problem is lack of clarity,\" says Mr. Tandon. At the beginning, the main consideration for entry to Seeps was export earnings, but the focus shifted to to employ- ment and technology. Mr Tan- don emphasises the need for clear policies and simplified systems in order to attract multi-national companies. \"There should be no discretion- ary powers,\" he says. However, the Seeps track record has been good in all spheres except technology transfer. \"Our original objec- tives have been achieved,\" says Mr Premkumar.

   "text_content" : "'MR Mahendra Singh Tikait, the burly and charismatic pres- ident of the Indian Farmers' Union, squats on the ground in .front of his mud-and-brick house in Sisauli village in .western Uttar Pradesh. He -frowns constantly and grunts replies to questions on the demands of his vast following of landowners in the region. Surrounded by bodyguards armed with shotguns, Mr Tikalt brushes aside the con- cessions made to farmers by politicians and threatens a national agitation if they are not given a better deal. He scoffs at the government's deci- sion to introduce a two-tier price policy on fertilisers and * demands restoration of the full subsidy that has been only par- tially restored by the finance minister. Fertiliser prices are topical and controversial because the government first raised them by 40 per cent in last July's budget and then, after severe criticism from within the rul- ing Congress party and the opposition, announced a two- tier policy that aimed at soften- .ing the impact of the subsidy cut. The policy is to sell fertilis- ers at a subsidised rate to what are called \"small and marginal .farmers\" (those with holdings of less then two-and-a-half acres) and at the full price for richer farmers. The aim is to save about Rs3Obn on fertiliser subsidies but the policy will have to be implemented by the -state governments which have *declared it impossible to administer. Mr Tikait is not worried by such academic arguments and * insists on farmers' rights to a .reasonable income based on cheap inputs such as fertilis- ers, electricity rates and diesel. His threatened agitation is real for Mr Tikait has shown he is capable of organising an effec- tive farmers' movement (in November, 1989, he organised a week-long sit-in by hundreds of thousands of farmers in front * of the Central government's offices in New Delhi). Mr Tikait cannot be ignored, even though his own following is restricted to the Jat (a farm- ers' caste) districts of western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Indian farmers are largely unorganised. The only other farmers' movement, that has A flar atends his rie paddy: crtlcsm fOclum mon Â« gained some momentum is that organised by Mr Sharad Joshi, a former World Bank official, who heads his own union in the western state of Maharash- tra and voices much the same demands as Mr Tikait. Farmers' leaders say that they need to be properly organ- ised if they are to improve their lot. Mr Joshi has argued that they cannot get a better deal unless they use pressure tactics on politicians and administrators to improve the terms of trade which, he claims, are heavily in favour of the urban areas. Yet, as the criticism of the fertiliser policy showed, India's politicians are all too aware of the need to nurture the land- owning and landless farmers who form 80 per cent of popula- tion of the country. Each has a vote and hence their political importance. The government itself insists that much of the current year's budget, in spite of the cuts in fertiliser and other subsidies, aims at providing for the wel- fare of farmers. Since farmers live in India's 1m villages and most are among the poorest in the country, many of the schemes for rural development are aimed at improving their lot. Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance, devoted a considerable part of his budget speech to show how the \"gov- ernment is committed to the uplift of the weakest and the most vulnerable sections of our society\". The schemes he outlined include projects such as employment generation, provi- sion of irrigation facilities, improving rural water supply Mr Tikait and Mr Joshi con- sider all this to be hogwash. There is no doubt that farmers have a genuine problem. Even though they have considerably raised the country's agricul- tural production and food-grain output reached a record 178m tonnes last year, their real incomes have been falling. This is despite a substantial rise in purchase prices of agri- cultural products early in Sep- tember to compensate the farmers for the higher costs of inputs such as fertilisers - and such populist schemes as waiver of loans by the VP Singh government which have raised the fiscal deficit. The waiver added nearly Rs40bn to the deficit. The movements organised by Mr Tikait and Mr Joshi are no peasants' revolts. Indeed, the mass of Indian peasantry remains unorganised because they are made up by landless labourers who are grossly under-employed and live in conditions of near poverty or are farmers with uneconomic holdings. The followers of Mr Tikait and Mr Joshi are land-owners cultivating farms which vary from two to 15 acres in size. What angers them is the fact that they have not shared in the gains that the country's undoubted progress in agricul- lure has made and that farm- ing continues to be unremuner- ative, in spite of the increase in production of all crops. One official study has shown that at present farmers owning up to seven acres have \"nega- tive household savings\" while those with 25 acres have incomes equal to clerks in gov- ernmient offices. Only the top 10 per cent of farmers owning more than 35 acres have size- able per capita incomes. The government faces big problems in. improving farm- ers' incomes since it is under pressure to cut subsidies on agricultural inputs in an attempt to cut the fiscal deficit. Dr Singh has already carried out his promise to raise the minimum support prices at which official agencies buy farm products, but this is at the cost of further fueling the strong inflationary pressures that are already evident. As the criticism of the with- drawal of the fertiliser subsidy shows, politicians and the farmers on whose vote they depend could block the govern- ment from fully carrying out fiscal reforms. In any case, Mr Tikait is not impressed by the government's case for reforms since he points to the growing economic disparities between the urban and rural sectors. \"We are totally disillusioned by the treatment meted out to farmers,\" says Mr Tikait. Hav- ing repeatedly demonstrated his ability to create turmoil, his threat to give New Delhi another taste of the farmers' power has to be taken seri- ously. K K Sharma",

   "text_content" : "THEil.arxists have been In ' pioweril WVest \"Die sall iic I77. But in Mr Jyoti Basu they have a chief minister who has the ) -ramtsm to welcome Hiis g good relations w stt ss community have not been sufficient to attract much investment to the , State over the past 14 years: Mr Basu blames this on the hostile apo h of Congress govern- mints In New Delhi. He says that bt1 h Mrs Indira Gandhi and her son Mr Rajiv Gandhi used the system of industrial licencing to divert private sec- tor Investment away from West Bengal. On top of this, since the Marxist accession to power, the -only new central project to be located in the state is the low temperature carbonisation plant involving an investment of 81.36 bn. The Marxists have clashed with Congress governments in New Delhi over a number of issues. They wanted a thor- ough overhaul of central-state relations, much to the distaste - of New Delhi. They asked the states to be given greater pow- ers in raising their own taxes- and for more funds to be trans- ferred to them from the-central government. Both Indira and Rajiv Gandhi realised that the Marx- ists enjoying popular support in the rural areas - where nearly 75 per cent of West Ben- gal's almost 60m people - live could not be dislodged from power by the state Congress party which was ridden with dissent. The Marxists contend that since they could not be defeated in elections, New Delhi hoped to keep them on a tight leash by denying them industrial investment. The scenario now is alto- gether different. Following delicensing, which released business houses from their obligation to turn to New Delhi for guidance, the states will have to compete among them- selves for private sector invest- ment. MrBasu is aware of the fundamental changes that have taken place. \"There is going to be competition among states. In the new competitive environment we must survive and prosper,\" he said. Politics of the past apart, the rather fragile infrastructure - power, telecommunication and roads - of West Bengal did put off many potential investors. For example, while demand for power has been growing by more then 100MW a year, there has been a zero growth in power capacity for nearly four years since 1986. It was only in Traffic In Calcutta: ti fragirl Intrastructure of West 1990-91 that new capacity of 277.5MW was brought on stream. Mr Basu admits that \"there is of course significant need for an' adequate and effi- cient infrastructure\". Mr Sanjiv Goenka, president of the Indian Chamber of Com- merce and vice chairman of the Rs21bn turnover RPG Group, is optimistic about the prospects for West Bengal. He says: \"West Bengal today pro- vides a very secure and peace- ful climate for commerce and industry. There is an air of expectancy all around with a government at Writers Build- ing (as the state secretariat is called) which understands its people and enjoys their sup- port.\" Mr Goenka knows West Ben- gal well. His group has four companies in the state, includ- ing CESC, the only power gen- erating enterprise in the pri- vate sector. As if to confirm his optimism about the state, Mr Goenka says that CESC, which supplies power to Calcutta, is undertaking an up to 500MW power project at Budge. The Rs 16bn power project is the second biggest private sec- tor investment in West Bengal assuming that the Haldia Pet- rochemicals project - which has suffered overrunning costs of over Rs25bn to 55bn - will finally take off. But it is only in recent years that West Bengal has been able to live down its negative image. The extremist move- ment and militant trade unionsm of the 70s took a heavy toll on the state. There was a flight of capital The suc- cess of the Marxists in the 1977 elections further complicated the situation. The Marxists then did not inspire confidence among the business community. Accord- ing to Mr Basu, the flight of capital from West Bengal has not altogether stopped. But he does not object as long as the local business houses \"invest a good portion of their profits in the state.\" The CKBirla group and the Mukand group have shown interest in setting up 2m tonne capacity steel plants. The Tatas along with Korf of Ger- many are setting up a pig iron plant at Kharagpur. The SK Birla group has just fin- ished a polypropylene film project. What could also stand West Bengal in good stead is that a large number of multinational affiliates are headquartered in Calcutta. Dr Abhiit Sen, presi- dent of the Bengal Chamber, believes that now that foreign companies can acquire a majority holding in Indian ven- tures, Calcutta based foregn affiliates might expand their business. Some Marxist colleagues of Mr Basu feel that he goes too far in befriending business- men. Mr Basu's reply to any such remarks is: \"I can't let West Bengal turn into a des- ert.\" He is anxious to draw the private sector into building new power plants. He asks: \"Where do I have the money to build new plants? I have invited the Tatas to set up a 1000MW power unit in my state. But I don't think it is necessary to sell off the power units in the government sector [to private industry],\" he says. Mr Basu's words of welcome to the private sector are in sharp contrast to the reception it gets from the state bureau- cracy. In spite of the relaxation of licencing by the central gov- ernment, new investment pro- posals will still have to clear to obtain clearances from the state government. Unless the state bureaucracy is responsive to the needs of business and industry, the new found enthusiasm about West Bengal will peter out. Much will also depend on how aggressively the West Bengal Industrial Developmental Cor- poration, a state agency, mar- kets the state among the entre- preneurs outside West Bengal.

   "text_content" : "THL goverment of prime minister Mr P V Narasimha l&ao initiated a series of reformo in July to stabilise the economy and deregulate trade and industry. These include: 0 Curency: The rupee was devalutied in two stages on July I and 8 against the major cur rencies by just under 20 - cent. Since then, the rupee ha been allowed to depreciate fur- ther so that Â£1 is equal to 15s43.90. 0 Budget: Dr Manmohan Singh, the minister of finance, aid this aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit from 9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.5 per cent. As a result, current expendi- ture in 1991-92 is being cut by 4.9 per cent in real terms to Rsl,141.03bn. The cuts in expenditure include those on subsidies, particularly fertilis ers, export and sugar, which are reduced by Rs27.26bn. Defence expenditure, at lsl63bn shows a fall of about 8 per cent in real terms over the previous year. Since the budget was pres- ented, the International Mone- tary Fund has asked for a cut of another 5 per cent in govern- ment expenditure to compen- sate for the partial restoration of the fertiliser subsidy amounting to Rs8bn and its belief that the government had over-estimated its revenues from customs duties by RslObn. The budget raised income tax on companies by 5 per cent while continuing the surcharge of 15 per cent. 2 Foreign trade: Several changes aim at eliminating a substantial volume of import licensing and strengthening export incentives. Under a new requirement, imports by companies have been linked to their export per- formance. This has been achieved by a new instrument called \"eximscrip\" which enables companies to make imports at the rate of 30 per cent of the value of their exports. Eximscrips are freely tradea- ble. Imports of capital goods for new veturescan be made reely up to rvalueotRs20m. Items reerved for import and export by- government- owned triding jhouses Ã½have been reduced.Te matther will be reviewed next March to reduce the number further. : Industrial polic Industrial licensing has been abolished for all industries except those related to security ana strate- gic concerns. The Monopolies and Restric- tive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act is to be restructured. The government's approval will no longer be required for expan- sion of existing units and for setting up new ones by comp- nies with assets of over Rslgn. : Foreign investment: Approval will be given auto- matically for direct foreign' equity investment up to 51 per cent for 34 categories of indus- tries. The foreign equity should cover the foreign exchange needed for imported capital goods. A special empowered board has been formed to negotiate with large foreign companies who wish to make long term investments in India covering several projects. Equity partici- pation up to 100 per cent will be allowed in certain cases. Payment of dividends will be monitored by the Reserve Bank to ensure that outflows on foreign exchange on this count are balanced by export earnings over a period of time. Automatic permission will be given for foreign technology agreements in \"high priority industries\" involving a maxi- mum lump sum payment of RslOm. Royalties of 5 per cent for domestic sales and 8 per cent for exports, subject to total payments of eight per cent of sales over a 10-year period, will be allowed. - Public sector: The govern- ment has announced its inten- tion to partially privatise selected public sector units by offering up to 20 per cent of their equity to investment institutions and to workers in the concerns. Government-owned indus- tries are to be given more involve cuts in -the-publlc sc tor labour foiirce tbroui cl- sure of, some compaies. The only detail the government has given so fair of t \"exit\" poly is that a fud is to be set up Jointly by the government, ri- vate companies, public sector units and state governments for workers to be offered early retirement. Investments by the gvern- ment in industry will be lim- ited mainly to areas of strate- gic importance, high technology and essential infra- structure. However, the private sector will not be barred from some of these. * Interest rates: The mini- mum lending rate for top qual- ity commercial borrowers has been fixed at 18.5 per cent and greater flexibility on fixing interest rates has been allowed to banks and financial institu- tions. The government is commit- ted in principle to further reforms. These include: * Foreign trade: Dr Manmo- han Singh, the finance minis- ter told the Financial Times that he would announce a timetable for tariff cuts in the next budget to be presented to parliament in February, 1992. India has an average weighted tariff of about 112 per cent, among the highest in the world. * Taxation: As tariffs account for 50 per cent of the govern- ment's revenues, losses from cuts will have to be made up by raising direct taxes and excise duties. A reform of India's complicated direct and indirect taxation structure is overdue. * Financial sector: A commit- tee has been set up and is to submit its report in mid-No- vember. This will consider issues such as increased use of market mechanisms in allocat- ing credit, recapitalisation of the nationalised banks and giv- ing the banks greater auton- omy. K K Sharma",

   "text_content" : "vowed thait outhey bula ty the hat aaa Partywbich has won ovr The temple s cntroversial because it would.b beuilt on the site of a mosque which although disused, is still treated as sacred by Mosl'es, who number some inOm or 12 per cent of India's mopopulation indus allegeae tht.e msue was built in the 16th century on the site of a destroyed ter'. pie. The BJP did not capture the Delhi parliament, but it did win for the first time in Utter Pradesh, India's most populous -state with 138m people. Mr Singh thus became the BJPs most senior elected official yet. Although the party has previ- ously run some of India's smaller states, its tenure in Utter Pradesh will be seen as a key test of its ability to govern the country. Mr Singh has impeccable credentials as an opposition politician and must now trans- late them into his position as head of government. Born in 1982 of a famnning family in Aligarh district, he made his name as a powerful speaker and champion of rural communities when being elected seven times to the state's legislative assembly. He has been jailed seven times for political activities, including a 20-month detention under emergency rule. He kept the Ayodhya issue in the limelight in state poll- tics. Only a year ago, while leader of the BJP opposition in the legislative assembly, he was detained for six weeks under the National Security Act after agitation over Ayod- hya. The BJP's support is a mix of religious hardliners and middle class Hindus, particu- larly in the business commu- nity, who feel attracted by the idea of a Hindu state and by BJP tenets such as \"justice for all, appeasement for none\" which refer to concessions made to Muslim laws. They are also disillusioned with the Congress party which has been ruling India for most P.poC aUMra W - mo-Ull U AVOI VaO. Cenre o reuIMIou comronWvr: Wsinn Kgem in Iuxs in W pDolumul Iinugni of the years since indepen- dence, and by corruption in the government. The BJP's rise threatens the concept of a sec- ular state. The BJP takes a moderate line on economic matters - it probably has little quarrel with the economic liberalisation measures now being intro- duced by the government - and therefore depends on whip- ping up the religious funda- mentalist line in order to win further support nationally. It is thus caught somewhat in a trap: to appear credible as a governing party, it must appear sober and responsible, but it must also carry forward the momentum of the Ayodhya issue upon which it has staked itself. If Mr Singh is aware of this awkwardness, his determined manner betrafi no sign of it. \"At the election we got a man- date from the people to get the temple built. My government will remove all hindrances,\" he Kulyan Singh: the BJP's most senior elected official yet said. \"It is a national issue. It is a symbol of our national pride ... and a symbol of our national independence.\" Moves to begin construction without immediate demolition of the mosque are under way in Ayodhya. Meanwhile, however, Mr Singh's government finds itself IWW am W =M m W financially strapped and at the mercy of the government in Delhi. It is the first time that the ruling party in Lucknow has been different from that in Delhi, and the chief minister finds himself seeking an emer- gency loan of Rs7.9bn from the central government to meet an inherited budgetary emer- gency. Mr Singh has been forced to enact unpopular austerity mea- sures to cut the state govern- ment's spending, and is also concerned about the local effects of the Delhi govern- ment's economic measures, such as rising fertiliser prices - although he will not com- ment on whether he feels the measures are justified. He Is keen that Uttar Pradesh should attract foreign investment under the liberalised approach from Delhi. A clearer picture of the BJP's approach to government will appear over the coming months, with the Ayodhya issue likely to become more heated, despite the fervent desires of the state's powerful top civil servants that it should be settled locally by the com- munities at Ayodhya itself - and as the BJP administration evolves its own budgetary and economic policies. For Mr Singh, the way ahead is clear as he contemplates the minority government in Delhi. He says that BJP support for the Congress government - so far it has essentially backed the economic reform pro- gramme - will not be uncondi- tional. \"We will support or oppose depending on the merits and de-merits of central govern- ment,\" he says. But he clearly has few doubts as to the out- come of the next general elec- tion: '\"The prospects for Delhi are quite bright and the way to Delhi passes through Uttar Pradesh.\" Alexander Nicoll",
